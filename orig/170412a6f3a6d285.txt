*Today’s Verse:*

*Jesus said…”You shall Love the Lord your God with all **your heart, with
all your soul, and with *

*all your mind. **This is the first and great command. And the second is **like
it, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself. *(Mt. 22:37-39)



*Today’s Reflection: *

When I was young I had to memorized these

verses but it became difficult for me to under-

stand the third part of this verse because I thought loving myself a vain,
prideful thing to do. In other words, not a Christian thing. But it was
explained to me that it grieves God when we treat ourselves

poorly. Just as it would if we treated a brother or

sister in Christ poorly. When you find yourself being to critical,
negative, or demanding with yourself today, ask yourself: *Is this how I
would treat my best friend?*

*[Then be kind to yourself.] Remember Jesus loves **you and wants you to
love yourself too.*

*Pastor Al*
