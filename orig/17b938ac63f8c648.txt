*Today’s Verse:*

*A man who finds a wife finds a treasure and receives*

* favor from the Lord. *(Pro. 18:22)



*Today’s Reflection:*

This verse states that it is good to be married. Today’s

emphasis on individual freedom is misguided. Strong

individuals are important but so are strong marriages.

God created marriages for our enjoyment, and He pro-

nounced it good.



Amid the cares of married life—In spite of toil and

business strife—If you value you wife *Tell her so!*



There was a time you thought it bliss—To get the

favor of a kiss—A dozen now won’t come a miss—

*Tell her so!*



Do not act as if she has passed her prime—As though

to please her were a crime—If ever you loved her

now is the time to—*Tell her so*!



Never let her heart grow cold—Richer beauties will

unfold—She is worth her weight in gold—*Tell her so*!

*Pastor Sather*

*Help me to never grow inconsiderate of the gift You*

*have blest me with, I pray this all in Jesus name.*
