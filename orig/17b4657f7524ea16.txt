*Today’s Verse:*

*The lord demands fairness in every business deal;*

*He sets the stand. *(Pro. 16:11)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Whether we buy or sell, make a product or offer a

service, we know what is fair and honest and what

is unfair and dishonest. Sometimes we feel pressure

to be dishonest to advance ourselves or gain more

profit. But we want to obey God, there is no middle

ground. God demands honesty in every business

transaction. No amount of rationalizing can justify

a dishonest business practice. Honesty and fairness

are not always easy, but they are what God demands.

Ask Him for discernment and courage to be consist-

ently honest and fair.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Heavenly Father, I pray for discernment on *

*all my dealings. **Amen.*
