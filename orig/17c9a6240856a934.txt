*Today’s Verse:*

*Have you never heard or understood? Don’t you know*

* that the Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of all*

* the earth? He never grows faint or tired? No one can *

*measure the depths of His understanding. *(Isa. 40:28)



*Today’s Reflection:*

We did not come this far—nor to this place—alone,

but in the presence and power of our God. The circum-

stances of this moment are not greater than our God.

He knows them better than we do, yet He permits them.

And He will overcome them—within us if we will

allow Him. Ours is not to fret as though He does not

know, or care, or cannot overcome. Ours is to walk on

knowing that He is here. We are His by His creation,

and His by new birth. We are His to do with as He chooses—

to bless or to use up, to serve or to simply endure. The day

belongs to our Lord, and it is the only day we have to

serve and glorify Him. And so *I shall *give all that *I have* and

*am t*hat for this one day He shall be honored.

*Pastor Sather*

*I pray that I will continue to honor and glorify You*

* for the rest of my days**. *Amen.
