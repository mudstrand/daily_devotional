*Today's Verse:*
*For we do not have a High priest who is unable*
*to empathize with our weakness, but we have*
*One who has been tempted in every way, just*
*as we are--yet he did not sin. (Heb. 4:15) *NIV

*Today's Reflection:*
Jesus like us was tempted, but when He was
tempted in the desert by the devil He fought
back by speaking the word itself. We can be
comforted knowing that Jesus faced temptations
so He can sympathize with us. We can draw
encouraged from the fact that He did not fall
into sin. By His life he shows us that we to don't
have to sin when facing the seductive lure of
temptation. Remember Jesus is the only perfect
human being who has ever lived. *Ask Jesus to*
*direct you to Scriptures when you are tempted*
*Then prepare for the victory.*
* Pastor Sather*
