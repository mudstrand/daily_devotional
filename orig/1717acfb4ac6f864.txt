*Today’s Verse:*

*And all who believe in God’s Son have life. To those who **don’t believe
the Son will never experience eternal life, **but the *

*wrath of God remains upon them. *(Jn.3:36)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Jesus says that those who believe in Him *have (*not *will *have) eternal
life. John, the author of this Gospel, has been demon-strating that Jesus
is the true Son of God.

Jesus sets before us the greatest choice in life. We are responsible to
decide for

ourselves whom we will obey. (Jos. 24:15), and God wants us to choose Him

and live (Deut. 30:15-20). The wrath of God is God’s final Judgement and
rejection of the sinners. To put

off the choice is to choose not to follow Christ. The *great divide* comes
down to

choosing Christ and receiving eternal life *or *not believe and
receive the wrath
of God. *Indecision is a fatal decision,*

*especially at a time* *when none of us know if we **will be one of the
next statistics.*
