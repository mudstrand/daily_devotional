*Today’s Verse:*

*My job was to plant the seed in your hearts, and Apollos **watered it but
it was God, not *

*we, who made it grow. *(I Cor. 3:6)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Paul planted the seed of the Good News message in people’s hearts. He was a
missionary pioneer; he brought the mess-

age of salvation. Apollos watered the seed.

He helped the believers grow stronger in

the faith. Paul founded the church in Cor-

inth, and Apollos built on the foundation. Tragically, the believers in
Corinth had

split into factions, pledging loyalty to diff-

erent teachers (I Cor. 1:11-13). After the preachers’ work is completed, God
is the

one who makes Christians grow. Our lead-

ers should certainly be respected, but we should not put them on a pedestal
that creat-

es barriers between people or set them up as

a substitute for Christ.

*Ask the Holy Spirt to bless the preaching *

*of** Christ’s Gospel in the world and the testimony **we give by our
personal words *

*and deeds.*
