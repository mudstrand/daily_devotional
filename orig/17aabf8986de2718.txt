(Please read Pro. 12:14-19)



My Verses:

*Some people make cutting remarks, but the words of*

*the wise bring healing. Truth stands the test of time; *

*lies are soon exposed.* (Pro. 12:18, 19)



*Today’s Reflection:*

When some people are annoyed or insulted, it is natural for

them to retaliate. But this solves nothing and only encour-

ages trouble*.* *Instead¸ *answer slowly and quietly. Your

positive response will achieve results. (Pro 15:1 says,

“A gentle answer turnes away wrath. Truth is always

timely; it applies today and in the future. Because it is

connected with God’s changeless character. Remember

the Bible has stood the test of time. Because God is truth,

you can trust His Word to guide you.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Lord of all grace and mercy I thank You for the greatest *

*gift ever given—the gift of eternal life, through faith in *

*Your risen Son our Lord Jesus Christ. **Amen.*
