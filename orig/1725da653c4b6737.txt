*Today’s Verse:*

*As water reflects a face, so one’s life reflects **the heart. *(Pro. 27:19)



*Today’s Reflection:*

When I was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago, my response wasn’t anger
or bitterness. But when you first hear that C. word it does shake you. But my
wife and I drew on Jesus for comfort. Even though we did not know what the
outcome would

be, our faith grew. We continued to believe that Jesus was in control and
was drawing us close, and He was. When I look back at that “spiritual checkup”
I realize that we responded with love, faith, strength, and hope because of
Jesus. When we face

adversity, Jesus wants His love and hope

to spill out of us. *His love fills us to overflowing and **changes the way
we respond to life and those **around us.*

*Pastor Sather*
