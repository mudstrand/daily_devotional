*Today’s Verses:*

*Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not **lean on your own
understanding. In all your ways **acknowledge Him, and He will make
straight your **paths. *(Pro. 3:5-6)



*Today’s Reflection:*

When we have an important decision to

make, we sometimes feel we can’t trust anyone—*not **even God*! *But* God
knows what is best for us He is a better judge

of what we need then we are! We

must trust Him completely in every choice we make. We should not omit
careful thinking or belittle our God-

given ability to reason; but we should

Not trust our own ideas to the exclus-

ion of All others. We must not be wise

in our own eyes but be willing to listen

to and be corrected by God’s Word and wise counselors. Bring your decisions

to God in prayer use the Bible as you guide; and then follow God’s leading.

He will direct your paths by both guid-ing and protecting you.
