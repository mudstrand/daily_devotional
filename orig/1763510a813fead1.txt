*Today’s Verse: *

*They worshiped together each day at the temple, met *

*in **homes for the Lord’s Supper., and shared their meals *

*with great joy. *(Acts. 3:46)



*Today’s reflection:*

The common misconception about first Christians

(who were Jews) was that they rejected the Jewish

religion. But these believers saw Jesus message and

resurrection as the fulfilment of everything they

believed from the Old Testament. The Jewish believers

at first did not separate themselves from the rest of the

Jewish community. They still went to the Temple and synagogue for worship
and instruction in the Scriptures.

But their belief in Jesus created great friction with Jews

who did not believe that Jesus *was the messiah.* So believing

Jews were forced to meet in private homes for Communion, prayer. and
teaching about Christ. *By the end of the first century, many* *of these
Jewish believers were excom-*

*municated from the synagogue.*
