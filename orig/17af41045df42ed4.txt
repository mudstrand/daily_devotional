*Today’s Verse:*

*Those who control their anger have great understanding;*

*those with a hasty temper will make mistakes.*

(Pro. 14:29)



*Today’s Reflection:*

A nasty and quick temper can be like a fire out of control.

It can burn us and everyone else in its path. Anger divides

people. It pushes us into hasty decisions that *only* cause

bitterness and guilt. Yet anger, in itself, is not wrong. Anger

can be a legitimate reaction to injustice and sin. When you

feel yourself getting angry, look for the cause. Are you reacting

to an evil situation that you are going to set right? Or are you

responding selfishly to a personal insult? Pray that God will help

you control a quick temper, changing your feelings into effective

action and conquering selfish anger through humility and repen-

tance.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Lord, when I feel that I am losing my temper, please step *

*in and help me bring it under control. **Amen.*
