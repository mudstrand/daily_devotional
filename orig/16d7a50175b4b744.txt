*Verse For Today:*

*[God] will command His angels concerning you to guard you *

*in all your ways. *(Ps. 91:11)



*Thoughts for Today:*

Much has been said about and written about angels. There

are book, songs, movies and even web sites. When the

Psalmist declares that angels attend us in all our ways, the understanding is
that we have their coverage as we discharge our God-pleasing, Christian
vocation. The promise *does not* extend to activities that are sinful or
that put God to the test.

When Satan tempted Jesus to leap from the highest point of

the temple, he quoted this psalm *but* left out some important

words. Our Lord refused to yield to this temptation, for He

knew the omitted phrase “in all your ways” *did not* assure

Him of angelic protection for such a foolish act. *The function *

*of angels is threefold: to praise God **to carry out his commands* *and
to serve mankind.*
