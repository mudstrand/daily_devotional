*Today’s Verse:*

*Don’t speak evil against each other, my dear brothers and sisters. If you
criticize each other and condemn each other, then you are criticizing and
condemning God’s law. But **you are not a judge who can decide whether the
law is**right or wrong. Your job is to obey it. *(Jm. 4:11)


*Today’s Reflection:*

Jesus summarizes the law as love for God and neighbor (Mt. 22:37-40), and
Paul said that love demonstrated toward your neighbor would fully satisfy
the law (Ro. 13:6-10). When we fail to

love, we are actually breaking God’s law. Take

time to examine your attitude and actions toward others. Do you build
people up or do you tear

them down. When you are ready to criticize someone, *remember *God’s law of
love and say something good instead. Saying something benef-

icial to others will cure you of finding fault; and increase your ability
to obey God’s Law of love.

*Pastor Sather*

*God alone has the power to save or destroy. So what *

*right do we have to condemn our neighbor? *
