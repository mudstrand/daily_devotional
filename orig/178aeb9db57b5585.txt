*Today’s Verse:*

*The gold bells and the pomegranates are *

*to alternate around the** hem of the robe. *

(Ex. 28:34)



*Today’s Reflection:*

The verse above gives insight into a

difference between the Old and New Testaments. God’s ceremonial law

prescribed ever so many things, not

only pertaining to the Sabbath and to

circumcision, but down to the details

of the High Priest’s robe. As New

Testament people, we are accustomed

to exercising freedom as to the design

and use of a pastor’s vestments, the

order of worship in church services,

and the like. We have freedom in such

things because God has neither comman-

ded nor forbidden them in the New Test-

ament. *But any freedom is always to be *

*used respons**ibly*.

*Pastor Sather*

*Give thanks to God who, for Jesus’ sake, *

*has freed us from bon**dage to the Law, *

*asking Him that we may never mislead *

*others** by our freedoms.*
