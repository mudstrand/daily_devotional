*Today’s Verses:*

*My dear brothers and sisters, if anyone among *

*you won**ders from the truth and is brought back again, you can be sure
that the one who brings *

*that person back will save** that sinner from death *

*and bring about the forgiveness **of many sins.*




*Today’s Reflection: *We have come to the end of the book of James.

What we should have leaned is the importance

of faith in action. Right living should be the evid-

ence and result of faith. The church *must* serve

with compassion, speak lovingly and truthfully*, *

live in obedience to God’ commands, and love

one another. The body of believers ought to be

an example of heaven *on *earth*, *drawing people

to Christ through love for God and each other.

If we truly believe God’s Word, we will live it day

by day. God’s Word is not merely something we

read or think about, *but something we do.*

*Pastor Sather*

*REMEMBER, belief, faith and trust must have hands **and feet—ours.*
