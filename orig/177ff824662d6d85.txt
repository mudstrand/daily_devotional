*Today’s Verse:*

*Teach your children to choose the right *

*path, and **when they are older, they will *

*remain upon it. *(Pro. 22:6)



*Today’s Reflection:*

In the process of helping our children

“choose the right path,” we must discern differing paths for each child. It
is natural

to want to bring up all our children alike

or train them the same way. This verse im-

plies that parents should discern the individ-

uality and special strengths that God has

given each one. While we should not con-

done or excuse self-will, each child has

natural inclinations that *parents* can develop. By talking to teachers,
other parents, and grandparents, we can better discern and develop the
individual capabilities of each child.

*Pastor Sather*

*Give thanks for your Christian education *

*and **pray to the Lord Jesus to nurture you *

*in the **faith. *
