*Todays Verse: *

*Set your affection on things above, not of things*

* of the earth *(Col. 3:2)



*Todayâ€™s Reflection:*

Setting our sights on heaven means striving

to put heavenly priorities into daily practice.

Letting heaven fill our thoughts means con-

centrating on the eternal instead of the tem-

poral. *We need to let the peace of* *Christ *

*rule in our hearts.*

* Pastor Sather*
