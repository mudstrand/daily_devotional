*Today's Verses:*
*Let me use this illustration. You can not enter a strong*
*man's house and rob him without first tying him up. Only*
*then can his house be robbed. Anyone who isn't helping*
*me opposes me, and anyone who isn't working with me*
*is actually working against me. *(Mt. 12:29-30)

*Today's Reflection:*
We need to remember this, that at Jesus' birth, Satan's power
and control were disrupted. In the wilderness Jesus overcame
Satan's temptations, and at the resurrection He defeated Satan's
ultimate weapon-death. Eventually Satan will be constrained for-
ever. (Rev. 20:10),and evil will no longer prevail on earth.Jesus
has complete power and authority over Satan and all his forces.
it is impossible to be neutral about Christ. Anyone who is not act-
ively following Him has chosen to reject Him. Any person who
attempts to remain neutral in the struggle of good against evil is
choosing to be separated from God who alone is good.*To refuse*
*to follow Christ is to choose to be on Satan's side.*
* Pastor Sather*
