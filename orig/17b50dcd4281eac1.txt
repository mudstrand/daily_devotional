*Today’s Verse:*

*Discretion is a life-giving fountain to those who possess *

*it, but discipline is wasted on fools. *(Pro. 16:22)



*Today’s Reflection:*

For centuries people sought a fountain of youth, a spring

that promised to give eternal life and vitality. It was never

found. But God’s wisdom is a life-giving fountain that can

make a person, happy, healthy, and alive forever. How?

When we live by God’s Word, He washes away the deadly

effects of sin (read Titus 3:4-8), and the hope of eternal

life with Him that gives us a joyful perspective on our

present life. The fountain of life was only a dream, but the

life-giving is a reality. *The choice is yours.* We can be

enlightened by God’s wisdom, or we can be dragged

down by the weight of our own foolishness.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Heavenly Father, search my heart and enlighten it*

*with Your wisdom. **Amen.*
