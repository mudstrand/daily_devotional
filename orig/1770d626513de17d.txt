*Today’s Verse:*

*You know the grace of your Lord Jesus *

*Christ, that though **He was rich, yet for *

*your sakes He became pour, so that **you through His poverty might become
rich. *

(*2 Cor. 8:9).*

*Today’s Reflection:*

The Bible has much to say about greed

as being morally wrong. In the first Commandment, God declares:” You

shall have no other gods before me”

(Deut. 5:7). He tells us to fear, love and

trust in Him above all things. It is a trans-

gression of God’s Law to be greedy, to

make an idol of wealth of any kind. How

do we overcome greed? We need to look

to Jesus Christ. He the Son of God gave

up everything when He Became incarnate

and was born into poverty. He came to

atone for all our sins, greed included, and

to bring us the incomparable riches of

heaven. His poverty resulted in great

spiritual wealth for us: peace with God,

the full and free forgiveness of sins as His children and heirs of eternal
life. The temp-

orary things of this world lose their appeal; greed vanishes, for we have
the riches of Christ’s grace. *Let us **thank Jesus **for His grace in
sacrificing everything, **even His *

*very** life, for our eternal welfare.*
