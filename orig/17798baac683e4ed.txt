*Today’s Verse:*

*Don’t sin by letting your anger gain control over you. Don’t let the sun
go down while *

*you are still angry *(Eph. 4:26)



*Today’s Reflection:*

The Bible doesn’t tell us that we shouldn’t

feel angry, but points out that it is important

to handle our anger properly. If vented thoughtlessly, anger can hurt
others and destroy relationships. If bottled up inside,

it can cause us to become bitter and destroy

us from within. Paul tells us to deal with

our anger immediately in a way that builds relationships rather than
destroy them. If we nurse our anger, we will give Satan an
oppor-tunity to divide
us. Are you angry with some-

one right now? What can you do to resolve your differences? Don’t let the
day end be-

fore you begin to work on mending your relationship.

*Pastor Sather*

*Let us thank Christ for reconciling man-*

*kind with **God so we can live in peace with others.*
