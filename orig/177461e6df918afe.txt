*Today’s Verse:*

*He will be called . . . Prince of Peace. *

(Isa. 9:6)



*Today’s Reflection:*

How can we be sure of the permanence

of Christ’s peace? The prophet continued

with this proof: “For to us a Child is born,

to us a Son is given.” (Isa. 9:6). This Child made a perfect and permanent
peace with

God through the reconciation He effected as

the Lamb of God sacrificed for our sins.

Now the church’s spokesmen can comfort God’s people by proclaiming to them
that

their warfare is accomplished, their iniquity

is pardoned. As God in Christ forgives us,

so we are to forgive others. *We do more *

*than bury the hatch with* *the** handle sticking out. We forgive really
and truly—from **the heart. We are to live in peace *

*with all people.*

* Pastor Sather*



*Let us thank the Savior, the price of peace, for carrying out **His
ministry of reconcil-iation and for granting us peace.*
