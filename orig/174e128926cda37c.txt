*Today’s Verse:*

*Peter says to the crowd, “the name of Jesus has healed this man—**and you
know how lame he was before. Faith in Jesus’ name has **caused the healing
before your very eyes.” *(Acts. 3:16)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Jesus not the apostles, received the glory for the healing

of the lame man. In those days a man’s name represented his charcater. it
stood for his authority and power. By using Jesus’ name, Peter showed who
gave him the auth-ority and power to heal, the apostles did not emphasize
what they could do but what God could do through them. Jesus’ name is not
to be used as magic—it must be used

in faith. When we pray in Jesus name, we must remember that it is Christ
himself *not merely the sound of His name, that gives our prayers **their
power.*
