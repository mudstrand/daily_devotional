*Please read * (Pro. 2:10-15)



*Today’s Verses:*

*Discretion will watch over you, understanding *

*will guard you, delivering you from the way of *

*evil, from men of per-verted speech. *

(Pro. 2:11, 12)



*Today’s Reflection:*

As you continue to read Proverbs you will notice

that it often teaches a “*two way” *theology. There

are two ways, one of life, and one of death., you

will notice there is a great difference between the

*two ways. *The *way of good**ness* is followed by

those who trust in the Lord for salvation,and

of course *the way of evil*, followed by the ungod-

ly. Those who leave the *right* path for the way of

evil eventually come to realize and delight in the

way they have chosen. *It all happened through *

*the effective working** of the devil, what is repul-sive at first becomes
interes**ting, then acceptable, and finally a source of sinful delight.*

* Pastor Sather*

*Dear Lord help us not to fall into the devious *

*path **Satan sets for us. **Amen.*
