*Subject: TO TEACH AND TO TRAIN *(Pro. 3:10-11)


*Today’s Verses:*

*My child do not ignore it when the Lord disciplines **you,*

*and do **not be discouraged when He corrects**you. For **the *

*Lord corrects those He loves, just as **a father corrects **a *

*child in whom he delights.*



*Today’s Reflection:*

It is difficult to know when God has be disciplining us until

we look back on the situation later. Not every calamity comes

from God, of course. But if we rebel against God and refuse

to repent when God has identified some sin in our life, He may

use guilt, crises, or bad experiences to bring us back to Him.

Sometimes, however, difficult times come even when there

is no flagrant sin in our life. Then our response should be

patience, integrity, and confidence that God will show us what

to do.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Heavenly Father, it is my eternal wish that **I will make *

*You a vital part of my life. **Amen.*
