*Today’s Verse:*

* Wait patiently for the Lord. Be brave and *

*courageous.** Yes, wait patiently for the Lord. *

(Ps. 27:14)



*Today’s Reflection:*

David knew from experience what it meant to

wait for the Lord. He had been anointed king at

age 16 but didn’t become king until he was 30.

During the interim, he was chased through the wilderness by jealous king
Saul. David had to

wait on God for the fulfilment of his promise to

reign. Later, after becoming king, He was chased

by his rebellious son, Absalom. Waiting for God

is not easy Often it seems that He isn’t answering

our prayers or doesn’t understand the urgency of

our situation. That kind of thinking implies that

God is not in control or is not fair. But God *IS *

worth waiting for (Lam. 3:24-26 calls us to hope

in and wait for the Lord because often God uses

times of waiting to refresh, renew, and teach us.

*Make good use of your waiting times **by* *discov-*

*ering **what God may be trying to teach you in*

* them.*
