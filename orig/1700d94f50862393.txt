*Today’s Verse:*

*Be full of love for others, following the example of Christ **who loved
you and *

*gave Himself to God as a sacrifice to*

*take away your sins. And God was *

*pleased, for Christ’s **love for you was *

*like a sweet perfume. *(Eph. 5:2)



*Today’s Reflection:*

There is no greater example in all

Scriptures then the one we see in the

first line of (Eph. 5:2). *“Be full of love *

*for others, **following the example of Christ.” * How have we been doing?

Iknow in my own life I have surely

fallen short. A TRUE LOVE—is desires

to please Christ, it’s not something extra

for the Christian. It is basic to Christian sanctity. It is not a dessert,
but the main course—not a sideshow, but he main

tent. It is not a motive to which we can resort to when convenient; it is a
controlling force to which we have committed our lives. *This is the
lifestyle of love: The question we **need to ask ourselves is are we
pleasing Christ**?*
