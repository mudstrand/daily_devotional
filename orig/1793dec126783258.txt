*Today’s Verse:*

*If you need wisdom—If you want to know what *

*God wants you to do—ask Him, and He will *

*gladly tell you, He will not resent your asking. *

*But when you ask Him, be sure you expect an *

*answer, for a doubtful mind is as unsettled as *

*a **wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by *

*the wind.* (Jm. 1:5-6) read (1:5-8)



*Today’s Reflection:*

*Wisdom* means “practical discernment.” It

begins with respect for God—leads to right

living—*and* results in increased ability to

tell right from wrong. We must believe *not*

*only* in the existence of God but also in

His loving care.This includes relying on

God and expecting that He will hear

*and* answer when you pray. We must put

away our critical attitude when we come to

Him. God does not grant every thoughtless

or selfish request. We must have confidence

that God will align our desire with His purpose.

*Pastor Sather*

*Ask Him to stabilize your wavering or *

*doubtful mind, **then commit yourself *

*whole-heartedly to Him. . . . *
