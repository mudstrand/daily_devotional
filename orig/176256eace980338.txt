*Today’s Verses:*

*Their judgment is based on this fact: The light from *

*heaven came into the world, but they loved the dark-*

*ness more then the light, for their actions were evil. *

*They hate the light because they want to sin in the *

*darkness. They stay away from the light for their sins *

*will be exposed and they will be punished. *

(Jn. 3:19-20)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Many people don’t want their lives exposed to God’s

light because they are afraid of what will be revealed.

They don’t want to be changed. Don’t be surprised

when these same people are threatened by your desire

to obey God and do what is right, because they are

afraid that the light in you may expose some of the

darkness in their lives. *Rather* *then giving into dis-*

*courage**ment, keep praying that* *they will come to *

*see how much better it is to live in* *Light **rather *

*than darkness.*
