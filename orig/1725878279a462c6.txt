*Today’s Verse:*

*Jesus said, “I am the living bread that came down **from heaven. Whoever
eats *

*this bread will live **forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will
give **for
the life of *

*the world.” *(Jn. 6:51)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Have we ever taken the time to study the list of medications and
supplements we take, much of which our human bodies

can normally get from a healthy diet

and ten minutes of fresh air and sunshine an provide. How often do we do
the same with our spiritual health?

We depend on supplements—some else’s insights, Sunday sermons, a brief
nugget heard on T V, as our entire spiritual intake for the week. We lean
on supplements rather than a rich diet of daily Bible

reading, prayer time, and reflection with Jesus. In (Jn. 15:7) He says we
should “abide” with Him. *We need to **establish *

*a regular extend time of savoring the*

*Bread of Life, taking time to ensure our spiritual **nutritional balance.*
