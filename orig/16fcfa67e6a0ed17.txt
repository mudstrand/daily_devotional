*Today’s Verse:*

*In the world you will have tribulation; but be *

*of good **cheer, I have overcome the world. *

(Jn. 16:33)



*Today’s Reflection:*

*Do you ever find yourself* uncertain of how to

console someone who is going through a difficult

time? Questions keep swirling through my head

when I am talking to a friend who needs consoling.

I feel compelled to mention a verse or two, because

it is the desire of Jesus to comfort. When Jesus was

surrounded by masses of hurting people, He had

compassion for them. Jesus tells us to “be of good

cheer” even when facing turbulent times. Whether

we are comforting people who share our faith or

others—who are struggling, we should put them,

in remembrance of the sweet, tender words of

Jesus that are able to sustain us when we are hurting.
