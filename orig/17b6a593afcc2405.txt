*Today’s Verse:*

*Disregarding another person’s faults preserves love; *

*Telling about them separates close friends. *(Pro. 17:9)



*Today’s Reflection:*

What is being said here is, that we should be willing to disregard

the faults of others. Covering over offenses is necessary to any
relationship. It is tempting, especially in an argument, to bring

up all the mistakes the other person has ever made. Love, however,

keeps it’s mouth shut—difficult though that may be. Try never to

bring anything into an argument that is unrelated to the topic being

discussed. As we grow to be like Christ, we will acquire God’s ability

to forget the confessed sins of the past.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Heavenly father, help me to disregard the faults **of others, *

*for You know only too well, that I have plenty **of my own. **Amen.*
