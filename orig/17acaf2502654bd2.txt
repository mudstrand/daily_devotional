* My Verse:*

*An unreliable messenger stumbles into trouble, *

*but a reliable messenger brings healing. *

(Pro. 13:17)



*Today’s Reflection:*

In Solomon’s day a king had to rely on a mess-

enger for information about his country. These

messengers had to be trustworthy. Inaccurate

information could lead to blood shed. Reliable

communication is still vital. If the message

received is different from the message sent,

managers, businesses, and diplomatic relations

can all break down. It is important to choose

your words well and avoid reacting until you

clearly understand what the other person means.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Lord, remind me to always examine *

*all information carefully before passing it to *

*others. **Amen.*
