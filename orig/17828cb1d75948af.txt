*Today’s Verse:*

*May you have the power to understand, *

*as all** God’s people should, how wide, *

*how long, how **high, and how deep His *

*love really is. *(Eph. 3:18) (read Eph. 3:14-21)

*Today’s Reflection:*

We can draw strength for the power and

love that exceeds the pressure of all earthly affliction: God’s love for us
in Christ. We

can sing, “Oh the height of Jesus’ love,

higher than the heav’ns above, deeper than

the depth of sea, lasting to eternity!

Love that found me—wonderous thought—found me when I sought Him not.” This

truth is based on the testimony of one who

was found by Jesus, although he was not seeking Him. Paul knew firsthand
the dimensions of Christ’s love. He wrote

that we may try to grasp its dimensions,

but Christ’s love for us is beyond our comprehension. It is a love that
“surpasses knowledge” (Eph. 3:19). In Christ “We

have redemption through His blood, the

forgiveness of sins, in accordance with

the riches of God’s grace. (Eph. 1:7)

*Pastor Sather*

*Give thanks and praise to your Savior for *

*His **boundless love.*
