(read Ps. 146)

*Verse for today:*

*Donâ€™t put your confidence in powerful people there is*

*No help for you there. *(Ps. 146:3)



*Thought for Today:*

The psalmist portrays powerful people as inadequate

saviors, making false promises they cannot deliver

(Ps. 146:3).

God is the hope and the help of the needy. Jesus

confirms His concern for the poor and afflicted in

(Lk. 4:18-21).

He does not separate the physical needs from the

spiritual needs but attends to both. *While God*

*not** the government, is the hope of the needy,*

*we are His instruments to help here on earth.*
