*Today’s Verses;*

*Don’t fail to correct your children. They won’t die if*

* you spank them. Physical discipline may well save *

*them from death. My child, how I will rejoice if you *

*become wise. Yes, my heart will thrill when you speak *

*what is right. *(Pro. 23: 12-16)



*Today’s Reflection:*

The stern tone of discipline here is offset by the affect-

tion expressed in verse 15 and 16. However, many par-

ents are reluctant to discipline their children at all. Some

fear that they will forfeit their relationship, afraid their

children will leave them, or they will resent them, or they

will stifle their children’s development. But correction

won’t kill children, and it may prevent them from foolish

moves that *will*.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Lord, I thank You for my parent’s concern that I *

*would learn the important things needed to live a Chris- *

*tian life. **Amen.*
