*Today’s Verse:*

*Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own
understanding; in all your ways submit to *

*Him, and He will make your paths straight. *(Pro. 3:5-6)



*Today’s Reflections:*

When we have an important decision to make, we sometimes think we can not
even trust God. In my experience it is because I have not had the patience
to wait on God. (Shame on me!) At those times I have forgotten that God
knows what is best for me. I have found through the years that He is a
better judge of

what I need. At the same time we should not omit

careful thinking or belittle our God-given ability to reason; but we should
not trust our own ideas to the exclusion of wise counselors and what the
Bible has

to say. *Let’s make God a vital part of everything *

*we do, then He will guide us, because we will be working to accomplish His
purpose.*
