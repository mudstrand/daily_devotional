*Verse for Today:*

*The seed sprouts and grows, … first the stalk, then the head,*

*Then the full kernel in the head*. (Mk. 4:27-28)



*Thoughts for Today:*

Seeds contain enormous power. Sown into the ground

these little “workers” take of their jackets and get busy.

New plants emerge and mature. We can prepare the

soil, fertilize it, irrigate, and sow the seeds. *But* that is

all we can do. We cannot put the germinating power

into the seed itself. That is the way it is with the Word

of God, the Gospel of Jesus Christ. As Christians we

proclaim it in our neighborhoods and to the world at large.

We prepare ourselves, speak words people can understand,

use the media at our disposal, and the like. *But *there is a

limit to what we can do. When it comes to producing

results in people—creating the saving, heart changing

faith—we can do nothing at all. *“No man can redeem the *

*l**ife of another or **give God a ransom for him” *(Ps. 49:7).

The Gospel has wonderful Power *“* *for the salvation of *

*everyone who believes”* (Ro. 1:16). *It is the Triune **God *

*who effects our salvation.*
