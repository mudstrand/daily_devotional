*Today’s Verse:*

*“Come, follow me,”* *Jesus said, “and I will make you ** fishers of
men.” *(Mk.
1:17)



*Today’s Reflection:*

While some are wishing for the church to somehow grow, others are preparing
themselves to be instruments of God in

church growth as “fishers of men”

(Mk. 1:17)

Some Christians in our time feel called

to leave what they are doing—to quit

their day jobs—so they can concentrate

all their energies on missions They become full time fishers of people. But
it is not the Lord’s will that we all do this. Some of

Christ’s disciples continue in their roles

as fishermen, farmers, mechanics, business executives, teachers, nurses,
secretaries, and housewives. In so doing, we fulfill the over-

all Christian vocation of being Christ’s witnesses wherever we live and
work.

*Pastor Sather*

*Pray that Christian missionaries through-*

*out the **world may win many souls for *

*Christ, the world’s **Savior.*
