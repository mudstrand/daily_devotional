*Today’s Verses:*

*The Lord despises pride; be assured that the proud will*

* be punished. Unfailing love and faithfulness cover sin;*

* evil is avoided by fear of the Lord. *(Pro. 16:5-6)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Some people have a little inner voice that sometimes whispers

“My way is best.” This has been known to be *pride*. To much

pride has a way of resisting God’s leadership and believing that

he or she are able to live without God’s help. If you find yourself wanting
to do it your way or looking down on other people, you

are being controlled by pride. Only when you eliminate pride

can God Help you, become all that He meant you to be.

*Pastor Sather*

*I pray that You will forgive me when my thoughts and actions *

*are less than pleasing to you. **Amen. *
