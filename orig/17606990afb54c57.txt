*Today’s Verse:*

(God provided a ram, in pace of Abraham’s)—*Then *

*Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught by his horns*

* in a bush. So he took the ram and sacrificed it as a burn*

* offering on the altar in place of his son. *(Gen. 22:13)




*Today’s Reflection: *Notice the parallel between the ram offered on the
altar as

a substitute for Isaac and Christ offered on the cross as a

substitute for us. Whereas God stopped Abraham from

sacrificing his son, God did not spare His own Son, Jesus,

from dying, on the cross. If Jesus had lived, the rest of

humankind would have died. God sent His only Son to die

for us so that we can be spared from the eternal death we

deserve and instead receive eternal life (Jn. 3:16)

*Did you remember to give thanks, thanks-giving day for*

* this undeserved gift of eternal life?*

* Pastor Sather *
