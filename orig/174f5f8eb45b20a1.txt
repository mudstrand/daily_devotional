*Subject: THE DANGER OF CRITICISM *(10-5-20)



*Today’s Verse:*

*Accept Christians who are weak in the faith, and do not*

*argue with them about what they think is right or wrong.*

(Ro. 14:1)



*Today’s Reflection:*

These verse assumes there will be differences of opinion

in the church about what is right and wrong. Paul says

we are not to quarrel about issues that are on matters of

opinion. Differences should not be feared or avoided

but accepted and handled with love. Do not expect every-

one, even in the best possible church, to agree on every

subject. Through sharing ideas we can come to a fuller

understanding of what the Bible teaches. Accept—listen

to—*and* respect others. *Differences of opinion need not*

*cause divisions. They can be a source of learning and*

*riches in our relationships.*

* Pastor Sather*
