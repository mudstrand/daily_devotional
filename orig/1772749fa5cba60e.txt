*Today’s Verse:*

*The People who walk in darkness will see a great light—a light** that will
shine on all who live in the land where death casts its** shadow. *

(Isa. 9:2)



*Today’s Reflection: *

Here Isaiah refers to Jesus as Great Light—

the apostle John also referred to Jesus as

the “Light” (Jn. I:9) Jesus referred to Him-

self as the “*Light of the world” *(Jn 8:12.

When I read the fact that this was considered as a time of ‘great darkness,
on the 6th I thought we were heading into a similar time, the fact of the
matter is we live in such a time. That ‘darkness” is sin. Then I remembered

God’s promise that He would send a light

who would shine on everyone living in the shadow of death. He would be both

“Wonderful Counselor” and “Mighty God.” This message of hope was fulfilled
in the

birth of Christ and the establishment of His

eternal Kingdom. *He came to deliver (all) people from **their slavery to
sin, the darkness we live in today.*
