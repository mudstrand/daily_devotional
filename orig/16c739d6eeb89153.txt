*Subject: ONLY FOR HIM *(read Ps. 95)

*Verse for 8/9/19:*
*I will sacrifice a thank offering to You and call on the name of the*
*Lord. *(Ps. 116:17)
*Thought for Today:*
Many think our Godward actions such as: prayer, singing, worship and
reading Scriptures,
are done as safety devices to prevent the Lord from zapping us. When we
think of God
that way, we will have wrong motives for any God-directed action. That kind
of thinking
leads us to pray and worship God for personal gain or approval. Our worship
of the Lord
is not done so we can somehow benefit. Instead, every heavenward thought or
action
should be done out of honor for Him and His greatness. *Sure,* we benefit
when we turn
our attention to God, but that should not be our motivation. *It is not*
for us we worship
God. It should always be for Him. *We don't worship God to gain His
benefits--we *
*already have them.*
* Pastor Al*
