*Today’s Verses:*

*As God’s fellow workers we urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain . .
. I tell you, now is the time of God’s favor, now is the day of salvation.*
(2 Cor. 6:1-2)


*Today’s Reflection:*

As far as our salvation is concerned, Christ

has completed it. *We— **can—add—nothing.* We are fully redeemed by Jesus’
blood shed on the cross. BUT let *us not* forget there is work for us to
do, *not* to earn salvation *but*

to serve the Lord in whatever situation He places us *. . . *Our response
is to do good

works for the glory of God, for the good of

our neighbor, and for the joy of knowing that we fulfill a purpose in life.
It is always time

to spread the glad tidings of salvation in Christ, The apostles faithfully
did what Christ commanded*—*they preached His Gospel to

the world. We too can praise our Lord by what we say and do. We confess our
faith in Him when we share what we have with others. We give our witness by
our actions and our words, and by what we leave undone: the works of a
sinful world.

*Pastor Sather*


*Let us give thanks to Christ for making us *

*a partner in the spreading **of the Gospel.*
