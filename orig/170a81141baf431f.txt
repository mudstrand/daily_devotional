*Today’s Verse:*

*You will show me the way of life, granting me the joy **of Your presence
and the pleasures of living with You **forever. *(Ps. 16:11)



*Today’s Reflection:*

The joys and benefits of a life lived in companion-

ship with God are beyond human comprehension. And the greatest thing of all
is, these benefits are now and forever. I think that to often we read
verses and don’t stop and really think about what the verse has really
revealed. So let’s give this some time to soak in. What are the benefits? I
believe He is offering a structure, open to

heaven, framing our pathway home in a way that adds clarity, beauty and a
hint of greatness. *But *

He still allows room for natural growth already in progress. It’s all about
the on-the-way-there moments. *Is Jesus **smiling down on you today and
saying, Thanks For **Following Me**!*
