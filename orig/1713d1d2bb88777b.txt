*Today’s Verses:*

*I pray that Christ will be more and more *

*at home in your hearts **as you trust in Him. May your roots go down deep
into the soil*

*of God’s marvelous love. And may you*

*have the power to under**stand, as all God’s people should, how wide, how
long, how*

*high, and how deep His love really is. May you experience **the love of
Christ, **though *

*it is so great you will never fully **under-*

*stand **it. Then you will be filled with the fullness of **life and power
that comes from God. *(Eph. 4:17-19)



*Today’s Reflection:*

This “fullness” is fully expressed in Christ (Col 2:9-10), in union with
Christ and through His empowering Spirit, we are

complete. We have all the fullness of God available to us. But we must
appropriate that fullness through faith and through prayer as we daily live
for Him, Paul’s

prayer for the Ephesians, and also for us.

is *let us ask the Holy Spirit to fill every aspect of our **life to the
fullest.*

* Pastor Sather*
