*Today’s Verses:*

*One day the apostles said to the Lord, “We need more faith; tell us how to
get it.” **Even if you had faith as *

*small as a mustard seed,,” ** the Lord answered, “you*

*could say to the mulberry tree, may God uproot you *

*and throw you into the **sea,’ and it would obey you.” *

(Lk. 17:5-6)



*Today’s Reflection: *

The disciples’ request was genuine, they wanted the

faith necessary for such radical forgiveness. But Jesus

did not directly answer their question because the

amount of faith is not as important as its genuineness. *What is faith?*

*It is complete trust and loyalty to God that results in a willingness to
do His **will. ** Faith *is not* something we

use to put on a show for others. It is a complete and humble obedience to
God’s will, readiness to do what-

ever He calls us to do. This amount of faith is not as important as the
right kind of faith—*Faith in our all-powerful God.*
