*Subject: CHRISTIANS as SAINTS *(read Col. 1:5-13)



*Verse for Today:*

*Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to*

* share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom *

*of light. *(Col. 1:12)



*Food for Thought:*

*Christians: *even before they enter the kingdom of light

in heaven, are people who let the light of the Gospel

shine through in their lives. In all they say and do—and

in all the evil things they leave undone—they give

evidence of their commitment to God, the Father of

lights. How do people become *saints *who let the light

shine through? It begins when the Holy Spirit enlightens

them through the Gospel and Holy Baptism, bring them

to faith in Jesus Christ, as their Savior. To declare

Christian as bona fide *saints* is *not* to say that they are

perfect. They are sinners still because of their continuing

spiritual weakness. *But sin does not rule their lives;*

*Jesus Christ does. *
