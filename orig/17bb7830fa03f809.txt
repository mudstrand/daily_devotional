*Today’s Verse:*

*Fear of the Lord give life, security, and protection *

*from harm. *(Pro. 19:23)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Those who fear the Lord receive “protection from harm,”

because of *their* healthy habits, *their* beneficial life-style,

and sometimes through God’s direction, and intervention.

Nevertheless the fear of the Lord does not always protect

us from the trouble in this life. Evil things still happen

to people who love the Lord. This verse is not a universal

promise but a general guideline. It describes what would

happen if this world were sinless, what *will* happen in the

new earth, *when *faithful believers will be under God’s

protection forever.

* Pastor Sather *

*I thank You Lord, for the promise of a New Earth, for*

*all who have remained faithful to You. It is my honest *

*endeavor to remain faithful to You. . . **Amen. *
