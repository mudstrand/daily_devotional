*Today’s Verse:*

*Dear friends, if we deliberately continue sinning*

*after we have received the full knowledge of the*

*truth, there is no other sacrifice that will cover*

*these sins*. (Heb. 10:26)



*Today’s Reflection:*

When people deliberately reject Christ’s offer of

salvation, the reject God’s most precious gift

they ignore the leading of the Holy Spirit, the

One who communicates to us God’s saving love.

This warning was given to the Jewish Christians

who were tempted to reject Christ for another

religion or, having understood Christ’s atoning

work. If anyone deliberately rejects the sacrifice

of Christ after clearly understanding the Good

News teaching about it, that there is no way for

that person to be saved, because *God does not*

*provide any other name in all of heaven for*

*people to call on to save them.*
