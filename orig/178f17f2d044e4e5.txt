*Today’s Verse:*

*We were therefore buried with Him through *

*baptism **into death in order that, just as Christ *

*was raised from **the dead through the glory of *

*the Father, we too may **live a new life. *(Ro. 6:4)

read (Ro. 6:1-10)


*Today's Reflection:*

Sometimes this change is very dramatic, a great miracle of divine grace.
For many, however, spirit-ual birth is not as dramatic but is,
nevertheless, miraculous. Baptized in infancy and given Christ-

ian instruction as they grew, they have believed in Jesus Christ as their
sole Savior all along, loving

and serving Him in response. That was the exper-

ience of Timothy, St Paul’s coworker, to whom the apostle wrote, *“From
infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, **which are able to make you
wise *

*for salvation through faith** in Christ Jesus”*

(2 Tim. 3:15).

*Pastor Sather*

*Let your prayer be marked by thankfulness to God for **your spiritual
rebirth, and by the resolve to live for **Christ every day.*
