*Today’s Verse:*

*Jesus said, “Let the little children come to Me, and do **not hinder them,
for the kingdom of heaven belongs to **such as these.” *(Mt. 19:14)



*Today’s Reflection:*

A minister was retiring, and had delivered his last sermon from the pulpit
where he had preached for many years. One of the faithful members stopped
as she went out the door

and asked, “Do you know what is the most important thing you said in all
these years?” “What was that?” the minster inquired, so he might learn of
one way he had helped some-

one. “You told us we cannot do anything to

get God to stop loving us!” was the quiet reply. The most important thing that
you can learn in life is that God never stops loving you!

--*Peter *lied about being one of the disciples, but God loved him (Mt.
26:70).

--*The mothers and their small children *were a problem for the disciples,
but God loved them (Mt. 19:14).

--*The woman* refused to give Jesus a drink of water from the well, but God
loved her

(Jn. 4:9).

No matter what your life has been like, He still loves you! *How much do
you love God?*

* Pastor Sather*
