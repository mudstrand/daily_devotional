*Today’s Verses:*

*So Christ Himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the
pastors and teachers. Their responsibility **is to equip God’s people
for works of service, so the*

*body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity **in the faith and
in the knowledge of the Son of God and*

*become mature, attaining to the whole measure of His** fullness of
Christ. *

(Eph. 4:11-13)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Our oneness in Christ does not destroy our individuality. The Holy Spirit
has given each Christian special gifts for

building up the church. Now that we

have these gifts, it is crucial to use them. Are you spiritually mature,
exercising the gifts God, that He has given you? If you know what your
gifts are, look for opportunities to serve. If you do not know, ask God to
show you, perhaps with

the help of your minister or Christian friends you will recognize, *your
special area of service, use your **gifts to strengthen and encourage the
church.*
