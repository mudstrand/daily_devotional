*Today’s Verses:*

*Whoever walks with the wise will become *

*wise; whoever walks with fools will suffer *

*harm. Trouble chases sinners, while blessings *

*chase the righteous. *(Pro. 13:20, 21)



*Today’s Reflection:*

When most people seek advise, they go to

their friends first because friends accept them

and usually agree with them. But that is why

they may not be able to help them with

difficult problems. Our friends are so much

like us they may not have the answers we

haven’t already heard. Instead, we should seek

out older wiser people to advise us. Wise people

have experienced a lot of life—and have succeed-

ed. They are not afraid to tell the truth. Seek out

some wise, godly people who can warn you of

the pitfalls ahead.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Lord, I pray for the wisdom to seek out *

*wise godly people for the advice I need to succeed *

*in life. **Amen. *
