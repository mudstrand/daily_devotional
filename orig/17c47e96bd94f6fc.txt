*Today’s Verses:*

*A person who plans evil will get a reputation as*

* a trouble maker the schemes of a fool are sinful; everyone *

*despises a mocker. *(Pro. 24:8, 9)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Plotting to do evil can be as wrong as doing it because what

you think determines what you will do. Left uncheck, wrong

desires will lead us to sin. God wants pure hearts, free from sin,

and planning evil brings sinful thoughts into our mind. Should

I say, “Then I might as well go ahead and do it because I’ve

already planned it?” *No*. You have sinned in your attitude, but

you have not yet harmed other people. You need to stop in your

tracks and ask God to forgive you and put you on a different path.

*Dear Heavenly Father, help me to always dwell **on pure thoughts. *

*Amen.*
