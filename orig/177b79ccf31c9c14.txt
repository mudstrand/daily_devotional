*Today’s Verse:*

*“The time is surely coming,” says the Sovereign Lord, “when I will send a
famine*

*on the land—**not a famine of bread or water but of hearing the Word of
the Lord.”* (Amos 8:11)



*Today’s Reflection:*

The people had no appetite for God’s Word when prophets like Amos brought
it. Because of their apathy, God said He would take away even the
opportunity to hear His word. We have His Word, the Bible. But many still
look everywhere for answers to life’s problems except in scriptures. You
can help them by directing them to the Bible, showing them

the parts that speak to their special needs and questions. God’s Word is
available to us. *Let us help people know it* *before a time comes when
they can not find it.*

* Pastor Sather*



*Let us ask God to grant us the continual *

*use of His Word and the sacraments, that through them we may be nurtured
and strengthened. *
