*Today’s Verse:*

*But Jesus replied,” ”That isn’t necessary—you feed them.” “Impossible!”** they
exclaimed. “We have only five loafs and two fish!” “Bring them here,” **He
said. *

*Then He told the people to sit down on the grass. And He took the **five
loafs and two fish, looked toward heaven, and asked God’s blessing on **the
food. *

(Mt. 14: 16—18a)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Jesus desires that we should surrender to is service

the little we have, our small gifts and strengths and

resources. The rest He will look after. His blessing

will make the little suffice. Unbelief says that it is insufficient to come
with the *little** we have for an*

enterprise so great! Faith says, Jesus asks for the

little we have, and He will take it into His service.

He will bless it until there is more than enough. *When we lay our gift
in the Lord’s hand *

*(and * *not in any man’s)** it will stretch as *

*far as the Lord wills.*

* Pastor Sather*
