*Subject: CHRISTIANS AS STEWARDS *(2-2-21)



*Today’s Verse:*

*He who has been stealing must steal no long-er but must work, **doing
something useful*

* with his own hands, that he may have*

*something** to share with those in need.*

(Eph. 4:28)


*Today’s Reflection:*

The first Christians, we are told, “had everything in common” (Acts 2:44).
Many sold their possessions and put their money

into a common fund. God had not comm-

anded such an arrangement, in fact, when

He commanded, “You shall not steal”

Ex. 20:15), He presupposed the existence

of private property. What God does require

is that His people be faithful stewards of all

that He gives them. All we have has been entrusted to us for furthering
God’s King-

dom. In this respect, the Jerusalem Christ-

ians were to set a good example, not that we should relinquish our goods
and enter into a communal lifestyle, but that we use our proceeds to God’s
glory and for the good of people, including ourselves. *It is interesting
to note that Paul **did not* *advocate communism.*

* Pastor Sather*

*We need to ask the Lord Jesus to strengthen us in the **conviction that
all we are and have** are at His disposal. *
