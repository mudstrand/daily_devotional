*Today’s Verse:*

*Now some may—argue, “Some people have faith; others have good deeds. “I
say, I can’t see your faith if you don’t have good deeds, but I will show
you my faith through my good deeds.” *(Jm. 2:18)



*Today’s Reflection:*

At first glance, this verse seems to contradict (Ro.3:28), *“We are made
right with God through faith and not by obeying the law.” *Deeper
investigation, however, shows that the teachings of James and Paul are not
at odds. While it is true that our good deeds can never earn salvation,
true faith always results in a changed life and good deeds. Paul speaks
against those who try to be saved by deeds instead of faith; James speaks
against those who confuse mere intellectual assent with true faith. After
all even demons know who Jesus is, but they don’t obey Him (Jm. 2:18) *True
faith involves a commitment of your whole self *

*to God.*
