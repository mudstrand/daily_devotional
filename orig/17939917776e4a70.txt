*Today’s Verse:*

*Let your endurance grow, for when it is fully developed, **you will be
strong in character and *

*ready for anything.* (Jm. 1:4) read (Jm. 1:2-4)



*Today’s Reflection:*

We *can not* really know the depth of our

character *until *we see how we react under

pressure. It is easy to be kind to others when everything is going well,
*but* can we still be

kind when others are treating us unfairly? *Remember*

God wants to make us mature and complete,

not to keep us from all pain. Instead of com-

plaining about our struggles, we should see

them as opportunities for growth. *Remember*

*Also,* God promises not to leave us alone

with our troubles, He promises to stay close

and help us grow.

*Pastor Sather*

*Thank God for promising to be with you in *

*rough times. Ask Him to help you solve your problems or give you strength
to endure them. *

*Then be patient!*
