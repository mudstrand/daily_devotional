*Today’s Verses:*

At dawn Jesus called out “Friends, have you caught any fish?” “No,” they
replied. “Throw out your net on the right-hand side of the boat, and you’ll
get plenty of fish!” So they did, and they couldn’t draw in the net because
there were so many fish in it.


*Today’s Reflection:*

Give this some thought: they had been casting out their nets all night
long. They were tired and ready to go home eat some breakfast and go to
bed. If you read verse four, it says they didn’t even recognize who was on
the beach. I can hear one

of them saying to the rest, why not we have nothing to lose. Well we know
what happened, they caught so many fish they

could not get them into the boat. I think that once in-a-while we need to
be reminded to trust Jesus. I also think that

if we did we’d be much better off. *So let us remember to **ask Jesus to
teach us to trust that He will provide for us.*
