*Today’s Verses:*

*You have heard that the law of Moses says, “Love your neighbor **and hate
your enemy. But I say, love your enemies! Pray for **those who persecute
you! * (Mt. 5:43-44)



*Today’s Reflection:*

By telling us to not retaliate, Jesus keeps us from taking the law into our
own hands. By loving and praying for our enemies, we can overcome evil with
good. The Pharisees interpreted (Lev. 19:18) as teaching that they should
love only those who love in return and (Ps. 139:19-22) as meaning they
should hate their enemies. But Jesus says

we are to love our enemies. If you love your enemies

and treat them well, you will truly show that Jesus is

Lord of your life. This is possible only for those who

give themselves fully to God, because only He can deliver people from
natural selfishness. *We must trust the Holy Spirit to help us show **love
to those for whom we may not feel love.*

* Pastor Sather*
