*Today’s Verse: *

*And we know that God causes everything to work together for **the good of
those who love God and*

* are called according to **His purpose for them. *

(Ro. 8:28)



*Today’s Reflection:*

The statement, *“For our good*,” does not mean that

all that happens to us is good. Evil is prevalent in

our fallen world, but God is able to turn every circumstance around for
our long-range good. Note

that God is not working to make us happy but to

fulfill His purpose. Note also this promise is not for

everybody. It can be claimed only by those who love

God and are called by Him, that is *those* whom the

Holy Spirit convinces to follow Christ. Such people

have a new perspective, a new mind set. They trust

in God, not in worldly treasures: their security is in heaven, not on
earth. Their faith in God does not

waver in pain or persecution because they know

God is with them, and are called according to God’s purpose.
