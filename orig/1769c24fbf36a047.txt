*Today’s Verses:*

*Sing a new song to the Lord! Let the whole earth *

*sing to the Lord! **Sing to the Lord; bless His name. *

*Each day proclaim the good news **that He saves. Publish His glorious
deeds among the nations. *

*Tell **everyone about the amazing things He does. *

*Great is the Lord! **He is most worthy of praise! *

*He is to be revered above all the **gods. *(Ps. 96:1-4)


*Today’s Reflection:*

The psalmist sings out his praises to God, over-whelmed by all that God has
done. As we reflect

on God’s majesty and His goodness to us, we can-

not help telling others about Him. Witnessing comes

naturally when our hearts are full of appreciation

for what He has done. God has chosen to use us to “publish His glorious
deeds among the nations.”

Praise for our great God overflows from His

creation and should overflow from our lips. *How *

*well are you **doing at telling others about God’s greatness? *

* Pastor Sather*
