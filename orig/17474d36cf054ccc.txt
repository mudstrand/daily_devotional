*Today’s Verse:*

*So everywhere we go we tell everyone about Christ.*

*We warn them and teach them with all the wisdom*

*God has given us, for we want to present them to*

*God, perfect in their relationship to Christ. I work*

*very hard at this, as I depend on Christ’s mighty*

*power that works within us. *(Col 1:28-29)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Christ’s message is for everyone; so everywhere Paul

and Timothy went, they brought the Good News to all

who would listen. An effective presentation of the Good

News includes warning and teaching. The warning is

that without Christ, people are doomed to eternal

separation from God. The teaching is that salvation

is available through faith in Christ. As Christ works

in you, tell others about Him, warning and teaching

them in love*. Whom do you know who needs **to hear *

*this message.*
