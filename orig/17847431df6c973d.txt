*Today’s Verse:*

*The lord will watch over your coming and going both **now and forever. *(Ps.
121:8)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Whatever the situation in which God’s

people find themselves, one thing is sure:

God is with them and remembers them.

Psalm 121 is a beautiful reminder of

God’s promise to watch over us.---Our

divine Maker and Preserver is also our Redeemer in Christ Jesus, our
Savior.

God sent His beloved Son into the world

to redeem all its inhabitants from sin and

the fear of death. He also redeemed them

for something---for a purposeful life here

and now and for eternal life. So when we

see the song birds leave and other changes

each fall, we can be assured of God’s unchanging love for us and His
constant presence with us.

*Let us remember to pray the lines of the hymn “Abide **with Me.”*
