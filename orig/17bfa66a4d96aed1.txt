*Today’s Verse*

*True humility and fear of the Lord lead to riches, *

*honor, and long life. *(Pro. 22:4)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Have you ever noticed how the book of Proverbs

continually tells us how we should live? What I

have notice is that there is to be no exceptions.

Provers also contains *many* strong statements about

the benefits of wisdom, including long life, wealth,

honor, and peace. If you are not experiencing them,

does that mean you are short on wisdom?

*Not necessarily*. Instead of guarantees, these state-

ments are *general* principles. In a perfect world,

wise behavior would always lead to these benefits.

*Even *in this troubled world, living wisely usually

results in obvious blessings—*but not* always.

Sometimes sin intervenes, and some blessing must

be delayed until Jesus returns to establish His eternal

kingdom. That is why*— “We must live by believing *

*and not by** seeing.”*

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Heavenly Father, as You know without me*

*telling You, that without faith in You we would*

*be in serious trouble, forgive us when we go about*

*the things of this world forgetting that all we have*

*we have received because of Your grace. **Amen.*
