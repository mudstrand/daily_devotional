*Verse for Today:*

*Let everything that lives sing praises to the Lord*

*Praise the Lord! *(Ps. 150:6)



*Thoughts for Today:*

If you feel like treasure hunting go back and review

the psalms, in doing this you will discover the parallels

of our journey through life. It begins with presenting

us two roads: the way to *life* and the way to *death*. If

we choose Godâ€™s way to *life*, we will still face both

blessings and troubles, joy and grief, success and obstacles.

But throughout it all, God is at our side, guiding, encouraging,

comforting, and caring. Knowing this should cause us to

praise God for leading us in the right direction *and for*

*assuring us of a place in the perfect world He has in *

*store for those who have faithfully followed Him. *

* Pastor Al*
