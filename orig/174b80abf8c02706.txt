*Today’s Verses:*

*Later on God tested Abram’s faith and obedience.*

*“Abraham!” God called. “Yes” he replied. “He*

*I am.” “Take your son, your only son—yes, Isaac, whom you love so much—and
go to the land of*

*Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burn offering on *

*one of the mountains, which I will point out to you.” The next morning
Abraham got up early. He saddled his donkey and took two of his servants
with him, along with his son Isaac, *(Gen. 22:1-3a)



*Today’s Reflection:*

God tested Abraham, not to trip him up and watch

him fall, but to deepen his capacity to obey God and thus to develop his
character. Just as fire refines ore

to extract precious metals. I believe you will agree

that God has refined us a time or two through diffi-

cult circumstance. When we are tested we can com-plain, or we can try
to see how God is stretching us,

to develop our character. Obeying God is often a struggle because it may
mean giving up something

we truly want.* We should not expect our obedience to God to be easy or to
come naturally.*
