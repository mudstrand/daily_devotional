*Verse for Today:*

[Jesus] *asked him, “Do you want to get well?” * (Jn. 5:6)



*Thoughts Regarding This Verse:*

Jesus visited a well-known pool near one of Jerusalem’s

gates. The place was called Bethesda, literally a house

of mercy. When an angel stirred the pool the first one to

step in would be healed. Jesus approached a man who

had lain beside the pool for 38 years and asked if he wanted

to get well. The patient *could have* answered, “Of course I

do, why do you think I’ve been laying here?” But he answered Jesus, who was
unknown to him, with respect: “Sir *…* I have

no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred.

The man had not spoken words of prayer, but Jesus knew

the man’s desire. He said, “Get up *. . . *and walk” (Jn 5:8). Immediately the
man got up and walked. Sincere prayer

may consist of many words, a few words, or none-at-all.

What is important is He who searches our hearts knows

the mind of the Spirit, who intercedes for the believer in accordance with
God’s will” (Ro. 8:26-27). *Our Lord knows what is in our heart **when in
faith we come to Him with *

*words or without.*
