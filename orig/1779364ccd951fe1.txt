*Today’s Verse:*

*“You will be my witness in Jerusalem, *

*and all Judea **and Samaria, and to the *

*ends of the earth. *(Acts 18)



*Today’s Reflection:*

How wonderful it is to see that Christ’s

church continues to grow. *But, *it has *not *

been completed just because *these places*

have been evangelized. remember our Lord

says to every generation: “You will be my

witnesses *. . . *to the ends of the earth.”

*To this day **ALL* of Christ’s followers are

to teach all nations the Word of salvation

and baptize them in the name of the Triune

God. He who suffered and died for the sins

of mankind says “That Christ will suffer

and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance and forgiveness of sins
will be

preached in His name to all nations, begin-

ning at Jerusalem” (Lk. 24:46-47) *Remem-*

*ber* it is our call and privilege to be Christ’s witnesses wherever we are
in this world

and to send missionaries to places beyond our reach.

*Pastor Sather*

*We need to ask the risen and ascended *

*Savior to equip** us to be His witness at *

*home, at work, in School, and** in our community.*
