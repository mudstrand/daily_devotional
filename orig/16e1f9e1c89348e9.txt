*Verse for Today:*

*All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,*

*and are justified freely by His grace through the*

*redemption that came by Christ Jesus. *(ro. 3:23-24)



*Truths to Remember:*

The first truth is law, The Bible’s message of the

reality of sin. Through our first parents. Adam

and Eve, sin has come down on all humanity. Sin

exacts death as the penalty.

The next truth is Gospel, God’s grace extending to

all. This grace means *free*, *unearned*, and *unmerited*

*salvation*: the forgiveness of sins, the promise of

eternal life, and spiritual newness. Salvation by God’s

grace comes to us through the merits of Christ, who

atoned for the sin of the world.

The triad of truths “by grace alone,” “for Christ’s sake

alone,” and “though faith alone” has a fourth dimension

*sola Scriptura. *This is to say that the Bible is the only

source of what is taught in the church.

*By believing in Christ as the risen Lord and Savior we*

*become the beneficiaries of His righteousness and*

*holiness.*
