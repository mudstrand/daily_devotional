*Today’s Verse:*

*Commit your work to the Lord, and then your plans will succeed.*

(Pro. 16:3)



*Today’s Reflection:*

There are different ways to fail to commit what ever we do to the

Lord. Some people commit their work only superficially. They

say the project is being done for the Lord, but in reality they are

doing it for themselves. Others give God temporary control of

their interests, only to take control back the moment things stop

going the way they expect. *Still others* commit a task fully to the

Lord but put forward no effort themselves, and then they wonder

why they do not succeed. We must maintain a delicate balance:

trusting God as though everything depended on Him, while work-

ing as if everything depends on us. Think of a specific effort in

which you are involved right now. Have you committed it to the

Lord?

*Sather* *Pastor*

*Dear Heavenly Father, help me to always put my full trust in *

*You. **Amen.*
