*Today’s Verse:*

*And all of us have had that veil removed so that we*

*can be mirrors that brightly reflect to glory of the*

*Lord . And as the Spirit of the Lord works within us, **we become more and
more like Him and reflect His **glory even more. *(2 Cor. 3:18)



*Today’s Reflection:*

The glory that the Spirit imparts to the believer is

more excellent and lasts longer than the glory that

Moses experienced. By gazing at the nature of God

with unveiled minds, we can be more like Him. In

the Good News we see the truth about Christ, and

it transforms us morally as we understand and apply it. Through learning
about Christ’s life, we can understand how wonderful God is and what he

really is like. As our knowledge deepens, the Holy

Spirit helps us to change. *Becoming Christlike*

*Is a progressive experience*. (Ro. 8:29)
