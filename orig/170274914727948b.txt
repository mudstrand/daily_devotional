*Today’s Verse:*

*Let us consider one another in order to stir up love and*

*good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves*

*together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one*

*another, and so much the more as you see the DAY*

*approaching. *(Heb. 10:24-25)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Of how much good is a church member, detached

from the rest? How much fruit can a branch bear, detached from the vine?
How good is your hand when

it is, detached from the body?

When we come together in the church as an assembly,

Paul wrote, we are to help each other to “stir up love

and good works.” We need love and good works to be

able to reach the unsaved in the world today. At times,

we need to just surround ourselves with the love of one

another and encourage each other, knowing that our

hope for all things is in our Savior, Jesus Christ.

* A Christian is one who stays with the rest of the*

*church.*

* Pastor Al*
