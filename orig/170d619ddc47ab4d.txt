*Today’s Verse:*

*I know your deeds, that they are neither cold nor hot. I **wish you were
one or the other! So, because you are **lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am
about to spit you **out of my mouth. *(Rev. 3:15-16)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Today we see lines everywhere. They are in parking lots, at intersections,
baseball diamonds, basketball courts, and football fields. Lines can

be very important. They help us know where we stand. Jesus too, drew a line
when He called those from the multitude to follow Him. Jesus’ words make a
very perfect line: either you are for Christ or you are against Him. That
same line exists today. We must decide on which side of the line

we will stand. There is no middle ground with the Lord. If fact, for those who
try, it makes Him sick to His stomach. “He will spit them out.”

*A lot of people want to serve God, BUT only*

*on an advisory capacity. *
