*Today’s Verse: *

*(let us truly examine this verse)*

*“The time is surely coming,” says the Sovereign Lord, **“when I will send
a *

*famine on the land—**not a famine of *

*bread or water but of hearing the Word*

*of the Lord.”* (Amos 8:11)



*Today’s Reflection:*

The people had no appetite for God’s

Word when prophets like Amos brought

it. Because of their apathy, God said He

would take away even the opportunity

to hear His word. We have His Word, the Bible. *But many* still look every
where

for answers to life’s problems except in scriptures. You can help them by
directing them to the Bible, showing them the parts

that speak to their special needs and quest-

ions. God’s Word is available to us.

*Let us help people know it* *before a time comes when they** can not
find it.*

* Pastor Sather*


*Let us ask God to grant us the continual *

*use of** His Word and the sacraments, that through** them we may be
nurtured and strengthened. *
