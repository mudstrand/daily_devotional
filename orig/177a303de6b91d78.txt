*Today’s Verse:*

*[He] satisfies your desires with good things so*

*that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s *(Ps. 103:5)



*Today’s Reflection:*

David’s praise focused on God’s glorious deeds. Now we often find it easy
to com-

plain about life, but David’s list gives us plenty for which to praise God:
He forgives our sins, heals or diseases, redeems us from death, crowns us
with love and compassion, satisfies our desires, and gives righteous

ness and justice. We receive all these without

deserving any of them. No matter how difficult your life’s journey, you
can always count your blessings, past, present, and future. When you feel
as though you have nothing

for which to praise God, take time to read David’s list (Ps. 103:3-6).

* Pastor Sather*



*Let us remember to join David in giving thanks **to God for His renewing
grace in Christ and **for all His blessings that renew our life.*
