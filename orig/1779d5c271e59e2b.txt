*Today’s Verse:*

*“What God has joined together, let no man separate.” *(Mt. 19:6)

*Today’s Reflection:*

What has taken place is that the union of husband and wife

merges two persons in such a way that little can effect the

one without also affecting the other. Oneness in marriage

does not mean losing your personality in the personality

of the other. Instead, it means caring for your spouse as

you care for yourself, learning to anticipate his or her needs,

is helping the other to become all he or she can be. The

creation story tells of God’s plan that husband and wife

should be one (Gen. 2:24), and Jesus also referred to this

plan in (Mt. 19:4-6).

*Let our Valentine prayer be that the union of—and the*

*unity in—marriage everywhere maybe strengthened by*

*the self-sacrificing love of Christ. *



Let us remember to always be kind to our Valentine!
