*Today’s Verse:*

*Even the wilderness will rejoice in those *

*days. The **desert will blossom with flowers. *(Isa. 35:1)



*Today’s Reflection:*

In the next 34 verses Isaiah delivers a mess-

age of judgement on all nations, including Israel and Judah, for rejecting
God.

Although there have been glimpses of relief

and restoration for the remanent of faithful

believers, the climate of wrath, fury, judge-ment, and destruction, still
prevailed.

Now in verse one Isaiah comes through

with a vision of beauty and encourage-

ment. God is just in His mercy as He is in

His judgement. God’s complete moral perfection is revealed by his hatred
for all

sin, and this leads to judgement.

This same moral perfection is revealed in

His love for all He has created. This leads

to mercy for those who have sinned but

who have sincerely loved Jesus and put

their trust in Him.

“The effectual fervent **prayer of a righteous *

*man avails much” *(Jm. 5:16)
