*Today’s Thoughts:*

*It cost Mary and Joseph* the comforts of home during a

long period of exile in Egypt to protect the little Babe.

*It cost mothers* in and around Bethlehem the massacre of

their babies by the cruel order of Herod.

*It cost the shepherds* the complacency of their shepherd’s

life with the call to the manger and to tell the “good
news.”

*It cost the wise men* a long journey and expensive gifts

and changed lives.

*It cost the early apostles and the early church*

persecution and sometimes death.

*It cost missionaries of Christ* untold suffering and

privation to spread the good news.

*It cost Christian martyrs* in all ages their lives for

Christ’s sake.

*More than all this, it cost God the Father* His own Son—

He sent Him to earth to save men.

*It cost Jesus* a life of sacrifice and service, a death cruel

and unmatched in history.
