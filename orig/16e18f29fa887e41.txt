*Verse for Today:*

*Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, *

*who is in you, whom you have received from God? *(I Cor. 6:19)



*Thoughts Regarding This Verse:*

Our whole make-up belongs to God. We confess God to be

the maker of heaven and earth, and so is also Creator of each personâ€™s body
and soul. *But* *there is* *more*. Not only do we belong to God because He
made us and the Son of God redeemed us, *but also *because the Holy Spirit
lives in us to enlighten us with His gifts, sanctify us, and keeps us in
the

true faith. *So it is important that **we welcome Him through holy living.*

* Pastor Al*
