*Today’s Verses:*

*If you ignore criticism, you will end up in poverty *

*and disgrace; if you accept criticism, you will *

*be honored. It is pleasant to see dreams come *

*true, but fools will not turn from evil to attain *

*them. *(Pro. 13:18, 19)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Whether a “dream come true” is good or bad

depends on the nature of the dream or desire.

It is pleasant to achieve worth-while goals, but

all goals are not worth pursuing. When you set

your heart on something, you may lose your ability

to assess it objectively. With your desire blind-

ing your judgement, you may proceed with an un-

wise relationship, a wasteful purchase, or a poor-

ly conceived plan. *Remember* faithfulness is

a virtue, but stubbornness is not.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Lord, please remove any stubbornness *

*that plagues my mind. **Amen. *
