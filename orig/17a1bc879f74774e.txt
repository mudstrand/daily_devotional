*Subject: A FATHER’S WISE ADVICE *

*Please read* (Pro. 4:1-4)

*My Verse: *

*My father told me, “Take my words to heart. Follow*

*my instructions and you will live. *(Pro. 4:4)



*Today’s Reflection:*

One of the greatest responsibilities of parents is to

encourage their children to become wise. Here Sol-

omon tells how his father, David, encouraged him

to seek wisdom when he was young see (I kings

2:1-9) for David’s charge to his son. This encourage-

ment may have prompted Solomon to ask God for

an understanding mind above everything else (I

Kings 3:9). Wisdom can be passed from parents

to children, from generation to generation. Ultim-

ately, of course, all wisdom comes from God,

parents can only urge their children to turn to Him.

If your parent never taught you in this way, you

can learn from the Scriptures, and then create a

legacy of wisdom as you teach your own children.
