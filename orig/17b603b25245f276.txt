*Today’s Verse:*

*Fire tests the purity of silver and gold, but the **Lord *

*tests the heart. *(Pro. 17:3)



*Today’s Reflection:*

It takes intense heat to purify gold and sliver, similarly,

it often takes the heat of trials for the Christian to be

purified through trials. God shows us what is in us and

clears out anything that gets in the way of complete trust

in Him. Peter says“These trials are only to test your faith,

to show that it is strong and pure. It is being tested as fire

tests and purifies gold—and your faith is far more precious

to God than mere gold” (I Pet.1:7). So when tough times

come your way, realize that God wants to use them to

refine your faith and purify your heart.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Lord, when trials come my way, help me **realize that *

*You may be testing my faith. I pray **that my faith will stand *

*up **under the test. **Amen.*
