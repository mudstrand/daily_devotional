*Today’s Verses:*

*What is causing quarrels among you? Isn’t it the whole** army of evil
desires at war within you? *

*You want what **you don’t have, so you scheme and *

*kill to get it. You are** jealous for what others have, and you can’t
possess it, **so you fight and quarrel *

*to take it away from them. And **yet the reason **you *

*don’t have what you want is that you** don’t ask *

*God for it. *(Jm. 4:1, 2)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Any conflicts and disputes among believers are always harmful. James is
attempting to explain

that these quarrels result from evil desires battl-

ing within us. We want more possessions, more money, higher status, more
recognition. When

we don’t get what we want, we fight in order to

have it. Instead of aggressively grabbing what

we want, we should submit to God, let us ask

God to help us get rid of our selfish desires,

and trust Him to give us what we really need.

*Seek the God of wisdom to give you true wisdom.*


*Sorry for not sending the usual devos. but I just *

*got home from the hospital.*
