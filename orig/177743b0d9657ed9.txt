*Today’s Verse:*

*Since God did not even spare His own Son but*

*gave Him up for us all, won’t God, who gave us *

*Christ, also give us everything else? *(Ro. 8:32)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Do you ever think that you are not good enough

for God, so He surely will not save you? Do you

ever feel as if salvation is for everyone else?

Then this verse is especially for you. If God gave

His Son for the world*, *He isn’t going to hold the

the gift of salvation from you! If Christ gave His

life for you, He isn’t going to turn around and

condemn you! He will not withhold anything

you need to serve Him. The book of Roman’s

is an explanation of God’s redeeming grace—

it’s meant to be a book of comfort and confid-

ence, addressed to the person who is dealing

with doubt.

*Ask the Lord Jesus to renew your faith in His*

*great gift each day, so you will trust in Him to*

*give you lesser gifts. *
