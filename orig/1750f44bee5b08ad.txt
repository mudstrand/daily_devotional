*Today’s Verses:*

*there is one body and one Spirit—just as you were called to the one hope
that belongs to your call—one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and
Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. But grace was
given to each one of us according to the measure of Christ’s gift.*

(Eph. 4:4-7)



*Today’s Reflection:*

This is possibly a quotation of an early Christian hymn or creed. We see
other examples in (I Cor.12:3-6). We need to remember the Church’s unity is
rooted in the Trinity: *one Spirit* (v.4) *one Lord* (v. 5) *one Father*
(v.6). There

are seven “ones” God’s number of completeness. *One body. *The oneness of
the Church,is rooted in Christ Himself, into whom we are baptized (Ro.
12:5; I Cor. 12:13),* one Spirit. *That same indivisible Spirit unities

us all. The *one Lord* mentioned in v.5 is a confession

of Jesus as Yahweh, true God (Ro. 10:9); (I Cor. 12:3). The *one* *faith *is
not an act of believing, *but* what is believed: *true doctrine*, as
confessed through the Apostles’ Creed at Baptism (Col. 2:6-7) *one
baptism, *Although Baptism as new birth cannot be repeated (nor may “Spirit
Baptism” be separated from “water Baptism”), that is not the emphasis
here. Rather, Paul teaches that there is only one Baptism, into which
Christ Himself and all Christians are baptized and thereby joined. For the
true unity of the Church it is enough to agree about the doctrine of the
Gospel and the administration of the Sacraments. *It is NOT necessary* *that
human traditions, that is, rites *

*or ceremonies instituted by men, should be the same everywhere.*
