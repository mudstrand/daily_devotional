*MY Verse:*

*Drink water from your own well—share your love*

*only with your wife. *( Pro 5:15)



*Today’s Reflection:*

God never intended that marriage become boring,

lifeless*,* pleasureless*, *and dull. Sex is a gift God

gives to married people for their mutual enjoyment

Real happiness comes when we decide to find plea-

Sure in the spouse God has given us and to commit

ourselves to meeting his or her needs.The real danger

is in doubting that God knows And cares for us*. *We

then may resent His timeing and carelessly pursue sex-

tual pleasure without His blessing.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Lord help us to always respect the gift You*

*have blessed us with, we thank You for understand-*
*ing our every need.*
