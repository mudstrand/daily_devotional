*Today’s Food for Thought:* (11-24-2019)

One morning a mother took her three children to a

restaurant for breakfast. The smallest of the three

children sat at the very end of the row. She saw

that other people began eating as soon as they were

served without stopping to give thanks. When the

food was served to her, she shouted out to her mother:

“Mommy, don’t people ask the blessing in this place?”

You can imagine the embarrassment of those present.

Her mother tried to hush her. But the waitress said to

little Mary, “Yes we do, sister! You give thanks!”

Amazingly, at that very moment everybody else also

bowed their heads and offered thanks. *Embarrass them *

*and maybe you* *will bring them to their senses to say, *

*“Thank You God.” *
