*Today’s Verse:*

*Now there are different kinds of spiritual *

*gifts, but it is the same* *kinds of Holy Spirit who is the source of them
all *(I Cor. 12:4)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Let us remember that there is a beauty in God’s people that being that they
serve

with the variety of gifts given to them by

the Holy Spirit. Paul mentioned some:

“To one there is given through the Spirit

the message of wisdom, to another the mess-age of knowledge, -- to another
faith, -- to another the gifts of healing” (I Cor.12:8) and so on. The
Holy Spirit has one purpose in

distributing the spiritual gifts in so great a variety, and that is that
Christians not only profess but also proclaim that “Jesus is Lord” (I Cor.
12:3). What a privilege!

* Pastor Sather*

*Remember to always ask the Holy Spirit *

*to assist you in pro**perly using the gifts He has entrusted to you for
the sake of **Jesus, *

*your Savior.*
