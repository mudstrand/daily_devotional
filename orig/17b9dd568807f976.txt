*Today’s Verse:*

*It is better to be poor and honest than to be a fool*

*and dishonest. *(Pro. 19:1)



*Today’s Reflection:*

A blameless life is far more valuable than wealth,

but most people don’t act as if they believed this.

Afraid of not getting everything they want, they

will pay any price to increase their wealth—

cheating on their taxes, stealing from stores or

employers, withholding tithes, refusing to give.

But when we know and love God, we realize that

a lower standard of living—or even poverty—is

a small price to pay for personal integrity. Do your

actions show that you sacrifice your integrity to

increase your wealth? What changes do you need

to make in order to get your priorities straight*?*

* Pastor Sather*

*Dear Heavenly Father, I know that I am far *

*from perfect and never will be on this side of*

*paradise, so I pray You will continue to be *

*patient with me while we work together on*

*my * *problems. Amen*
