*My Verses:*

*It is possible to give freely and become more wealthy, but *

*those who are stingy will lose everything. The generous *

*prosper and are satisfied; those who refresh others will *

themselves* be refreshed. *(Pro, 11:24-25)



*Today’s Reflection:*

These verses seem to contradict what the world, who say,

“That does not make any sense!” The world says to hold

on to as much as possible, but God blesses those who give

freely of their possessions, time, and energy, when we give,

God supplies us with more so we can give more. In addition,

giving helps us gain a right perspective on our possessions.

We come to realize they were never ours to begin with, but

they were given to us by God to be used to help others.

What then do we gain by giving? Freedom from enslavement to our
possessions, the joy from helping others, and God’s approval.

* Pastor Sather*

*Dear Lord, it is always my wish to have Your approval. *

*Amen.*
