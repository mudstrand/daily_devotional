*Today’s Verse:*

*[A rich man] thought to himself. “What shall I do? I have **no place to
store my **crops—I will tear down my barns and **build bigger ones.” * (Lk.
12:17, 18)



*Today’s Reflections:*

“Wisdom may best describe our present scientific and cultural plateau,
yet spiritually
we are foolish for sure. Many men, seen as wise in the eyes of the world,
are

foolish in the eyes of our God. God, in no certain terms,

has said, “Fools make a mock at sin” (Prov. 14:9).

Our world says, “Do what makes you feel good; do your own thing!” God
has said. “He that trusts in his own heart is a fool” (Prov. 28:26).

The rich farmer in the twelfth chapter of Luke, who found comfort in his
accumulation of worldly goods, would be seen by many among us today as a
very wise

man. *But* God called him a fool (Luke: 12:20).

Our nation seems to be floating with the tide of moral and spiritual
corruption.

* Are you drifting with the tide, or are **you willing to *

*stem the tide—I would rather be fool in **the eyes of a **foolish **world,
than a fool in the eyes of my **all wise *

*Creator. *

* Pastor Al*
