*From An Embarrassed Waitress: *



A young girl sat at the counter of an ice cream store.

“How much is an ice cream Sunday?” she asked.

“Fifty cents,” the waitress answered with hardly a

glance at the child. The girl opened her fist and counted

her coins. She asked, “how much is a dish of plain ice

cream?” Annoyed, the waitress snapped, “thirty five

cents!” The girl counted out 35 cents and handed it

to the waitress. “I’ll take the plain Ice cream.” The

waitress took the money without a word and brought

the ice cream. After the small customer had eaten and

left, while the waitress was cleaning up, suddenly

became flushed with shame. There, neatly beside the

dish were two nickels and five pennies—her tip.

*What kind of heart do you have? Pastor Al*
