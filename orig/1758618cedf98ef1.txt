*Today’s Verse:*

*For a child is born to us, a son is given to us. And the*

*government will rest on His shoulders. These will be *

*His royal titles: Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,*

*Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. *(Isa. 9:6)



*Today's Reflection:*

Back in a time of darkness, God promised to send a

light who would shine on everyone living in the

shadow of death. Isaiah describes Him as both

“Wonderful Counselor” and “Mighty God.” This

message of hope was fulfilled in the birth of Christ

and the establishment of His eternal Kingdom. *He *

*came to deliver all people* *from their slavery to sin.*



*You may think I have lost it. This message is some-*

*thing we expect to hear during December, and*

*your right**! BUT let us pray that whatever kind of*

* government we will experience in the next four*

*years will depend on our Great Counselor. I hope *

*you agree with me that this will depend upon*

*every Christian praying that or governmental*

* leaders will look to the Great Counselor to guide*

*them. Let us also pray that we TOO will look for*

* His guidance.*
