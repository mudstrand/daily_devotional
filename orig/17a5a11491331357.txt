*My Verses:*

*I, Wisdom, live together with good judgement. I know*

*where to discover knowledge and discernment. All who*

* fear the Lord will hate evil. That is why I hate pride, *

*arrogance, corruption, and perverted speech.* (Pro. 8:12-13)



*Todayâ€™s Reflection:*

The more a person fears and respects God, the more he

or she will hate evil. Love for God and love for sin can-

not coexist. Harboring secret sins means that you are

tolerating evil within yourself.

* Pastor Sather*

*Dear Heavenly Father, help me make a clean break,*

*with sin so that I can commit myself completely to You. *

*Amen. *
