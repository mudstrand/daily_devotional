*Today’ Verse:*

*We are Christ’s ambassadors, and God is using **us to speak to you. We
urge you, as though Christ **Himself were here pleading *

*with you, “Be recon**ciled to God.”*

(2 Cor. 5:2)



*Today’s Reflection:*

God’s reconciliation of sinners is the top-

most truth of the Gospel. Reconciliation

with God proceeds—not follows—reconciliation to one another in the

community. An ambassador is an official representtative of one country to
another.

As believers, we are Christ’s ambassadors, sent with His message of
reconciliation to

the world. An ambassador of reconciliation has an important responsibility.
We dare not

take this responsibility lightly. *How well *

*are you fulfilling your commission of Christ’s **ambassador?*

* Pastor Sather*

*Ask His help for affecting greater recon-*

*cil**iation **among people.*
