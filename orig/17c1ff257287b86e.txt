*Today’s Verses:*

*When dinning with a ruler, pay attention to what is*

* put before you. If you are a big eater put a knife to *

*your throat, and don’t desire all the delicacies—*

*deception** may be involved. *(Pro. 23:1-3).



*Today’s Reflection:*

A man is DECEIVED if he is a hearer of the

Word and not a doer (Jm. 1:22)

A man is DECEIVED if he says he has no

sin (I Jn. 1:8)

A man is DECEIVED when he thinks him-

self to be something when he is nothing (Gal. 6:3)

A man is DECEIVED when he thinks himself

to be wise with worldly wisdom (I Cor 3:18)

A man is DECEIVED when he seems to be

religious and does not bridle his tongue. (Jm. 1:26)

A man is DECEIVED when he thinks thathe

will not reap what he sows ((Gal. 6:11)

A man is DECEIVED when he thinks that evil company will
not corrupt good morals (I Cor. 15:33)

A man is DECEIVED when he thinks that the unrighteousness
will inherit the kingdom of God (heaven) (I Cor.
6:9)

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Lord, when Satan tries to deceive me help me*

*to not pay attention to the above verses. With faith *

*in You all things are possible. **Amen.*
