*Today's Verse:*

*I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, who*

*became my son while I was in chains. Formerly he was useless to you, but
now*

*he has become useful to **you and to me.” * (Phil. 1:10, 11)

*Today’s Reflection:*

Here are three question to ask yourself.

*What use am I in the world*?

*Has my life really made a difference in*

*anything?*

*Would anything be appreciably different*

*if I were not here?*

What is the old saying about putting your

hand in a pail of water and withdrawing it:

the hole that remains is how much you will

be missed when you are gone! I am not pes-

simistic, depressed, or tired of living, but in

reality, I have to recognize that my life has

not made much of an impact on the world,

certainly nothing like I had intended when

I was 18 years old. But let us remember that

the human worth is not measured only in

terms of fame, fortune, or some social influence. Perhaps the greatest
measure of our value is how much we are needed by some other human being. *No
one is really useless unless they **have given up on life and love.*

* Pastor Sather*
