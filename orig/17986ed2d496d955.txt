*Today’s Verse:*

*Now some argue, “Some people have faith, *

*others have good deeds.” I say , I can not *

*see your faith if you do not have good deeds, *

*but I will show you my faith through my good *

*deeds. *(Jm. 2- 18)



*Today’s Reflection:*

At first glance, this verse seems to contradict

Romans 3:28,

“We are made right with God through faith

and not by obeying to law.” Deeper invest-

igation, however, shows the teaching of

James and Paul are not at odds with one

another. While it is true that our good deeds

can never earn us salvation, true faith always

results in a changed life *and* good deeds.

Paul speaks against those who try to be

saved by deeds instead of true faith; James

speaks against those who confess mere

intellectual assent with true faith. After

all, demons know who Jesus is, but they

do not obey Him (Jm. 2:19).

*Pastor Sather*

*True faith involves a commitment of your *

*whole self to God.*
