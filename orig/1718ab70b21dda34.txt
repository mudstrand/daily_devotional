*Today’s Verses:*

*When He was at the table with them, He took bread, **gave thanks, broke it
and began to give it to them. **Then their eyes were opened and they
recognized **Him, *

*and He disappeared from their sight.*

(Lk. 24:30-31)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Just after Jesus’s Triumph over death, Cleopas and another disciple
traveled the road to Emmaus, discussing our Lord and His empty tomb. As
they walked, Christ

joined them, but they did not recognize Him. After reaching the village,
they invited Him to join them at the table,

and He accepted. As Jesus *gave thanks *and broke the bread with them,
their eyes were opened, and they saw Him for who He truly was. As Jesus gave
thanks, what did He say that revealed His true

identity to the apostles? I wonder,

because after they recognized Him He

disappeared. Had He told them all they needed to hear and cut the meeting
short.

I‘m sure His prayer would forever remain

embedded in their minds. *Let us*

*remember** to **ask our Lord to always supply the right things **to say so
friends will welcome Him into our visit.*
