*Today’s Verses:*

*Dear brothers and sisters, you must be patient as *

*you wait for the Lord’s return. Consider the farmers who eagerly look for
the rains in the fall and the spring. They patiently wait for the precious
harvest *

*to ripen. You too, must be patient! *(Jm. 5:7, 8a)



*Today’s Reflection:*

I think we all know that the farmer cannot rush

the growth of his crops. But he does not take the summer off. There is a
lot of work to do to ensure

a good crop. In the same way, we must wait patient-

ly for Christ’s return. We can not make Him come back any sooner. But while
we wait, there is much work that we can do to advance God’s Kingdom. Both
the Christian and the farmer must look toward the future reward for their
labors.

*Pastor Sather*

*Don’t live as though Christ will never return . . . . . . *
