*Today’s Verse:*

*The Lord your God is the God of all gods and Lord of **all lords. He is
the Great*

*God, **mighty and awesome, **who shows no partially and takes no bribes. *

(Deut. 10:17)



*Today’s Reflection:*

In saying that the Lord your God is God of all gods and Lord of lords,
Moses was distinguishing the true God from all the local gods worshiped
throughout the land.

Then Moses went a step further, calling God “mighty and awesome.” He has
such awesome power and justice that people cannot stand before Him without
His mercy. Fortunately, His mercy toward His people is unlimited. When we
began to

grasp the extent of His mercy toward us we see what true love is and how
deeply God loves us. *Although our sins deserve* *severe judgment, **God
has chosen to show love* *and mercy to all **who seek Him.*
