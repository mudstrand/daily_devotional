*Today’s verses:*

*Dear friends, never avenge yourselves. Leave that to God. For it is
written, “I will take vengeance; I will repay those who deserve it,” says
the Lord. Instead, do what the Scriptures say .If your enemies are hungry,
feed them. If they are thirsty give them a drink, and they will feel
ashamed of what they have done to you. Don’t let evil get the bet of you.,
conquer evil by doing good. **(*Ro. 12:19-21)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Forgiveness involves both attitudes and actions. If you find it difficult
to feel forgiving toward someone who

has hurt you, try praying for them, and your attitude

every day. Then try responding with kind actions. If appropriate tell this
person that you would like to heal your relationship. Lend a helping hand.
Send him or her

a gift. Smile at him or her. *Many times you will discover right actions
lead to right feelings.*

* Pastor Sather*
