*Today’s Verse:*

*“Look at the proud! They trust in themselves, and their lives *

*are crooked; but the righteous will live by faith. *(Hab. 2:4)



*Today’s Reflection:*

If we listen carefully to those around us, we will learn to

distinguish three voices, or influences, which direct the thinking

and attitudes and actions of us all. We can hear them at our work,

in our homes, and in the quietness of our moments alone.

*Fear *(is the first voice) it disguises itself as “being safe,” as

“practical,” or “reasonable.” We need to look for the motive

behind the disguise.

*Fantasy *(is the second voice) disguises itself as “visionary,” as

“progressive,” “imaginative,” or creative.” Look for the motive

behind the disguise.

*Faith *is the third voice. *Faith* reminds us that this is God’s world,

that He is always with us, that He works with us and in spite of us

and that He will complete the wonderful work He began in spite

of what it may look like to us today! All three voices will speak to

you today. BUT only *faith* offers life. May we govern our personal
decisions and our decisions on behalf of the church through the voice

of *faith.*

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Heavenly Father, help me to always distinguish the correct *

*voice to follow, the voice of faith. **Amen. *
