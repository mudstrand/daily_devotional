*Today’s Verse:*

*The good soil represents honest good-hearted people **who hear God’s
message, cling to it, and steadily **produce a huge harvest. *(Lk. 8:15)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Many of our garden seeds when we have planted them, if they are truly cared
for, they send their roots down deep. They go down deep into the good soil,
likewise the Word takes root and grows to bear fruit. Its like they are
stubborn about it. And

apparently the fruit doesn’t always come fast and easy. It takes patient
endurance. This means we may fall down, but we get back up. We may doubt, but
we refuse to give up our faith. We get tired, but we keep fighting the good
fight. *Draw a **picture of what speaks to you about this parable.*

*Then hang it on your fridge to remind you to **tend your heart’s garden
and water it with f**aith.*

* Pastor Sather *
