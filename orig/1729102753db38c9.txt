*Today’s Verses:*

*He will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there will** be no more death
or sorrow or crying or pain. All **these things are gone forever.” And the
one sitting **on the throne said, “Look, I am making everything
**new.” *(Rev.
21:4-5a)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Although there are many things I don’t fully understand in the book of
Revelation, I’m so glad it lets us know that one day we will witness the
ending we long for. Jesus will lead an army in the final battle to
eradicate evil. All things will be made

new. We will live with Jesus forever and

no longer experience suffering, heartache, pain or death. In the meantime,
when a problem arises, or things don’t seem to be working out, we need to
remember that’s

because “*. . .* it is not yet the end. Are you

dealing with problems? *Remind yourself* *that **all earthly things will
pass away.*
