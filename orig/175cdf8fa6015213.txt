*Today’s Verses:*

*The Lord said to Moses—“Give these further instructions to *

*the Israelites when you present a peace offering: to the Lord, bring part
of it as a special gift to the Lord. Present it to him with your own hands
as an offering given to the Lord.”*

(Lev. 7:28-30a)



*Today’s Reflection:*

God told the people of Israel to bring their peace offerings personally,
with their own hands. They were to take time

and effort to express thanks to God. You are the *only* person who can
express your thankfulness to God and to others. Do you leave it to others
to express thanks for what people have done? Do you rely on the one leading
the prayer to thank God for you? *Take time yourself to express thanks* *both
to God and to others who have helped and blessed you.*

* Pastor Sather*
