*Verse for Today:*

*Give thanks to Him who alone does mighty miracles. *

*His **Faithful love endures forever. Give thanks to Him *

*who made **the heavens so skillfully. His faithful love endures forever.*

(Ps. 136:4-5)



*Thought for Today:*

The repetition of these verses should make the lesson

sink in. Godâ€™s love includes aspects of Love, kindness, mercy, and
faithfulness.
We never have to worry that

God will run out of love because it flows from a well

that will never run dry.

*God deserves our praise because His endless love *

*never fails.*

* Pastor Al*
