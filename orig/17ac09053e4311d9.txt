*Today’s Verses:*

*Those who are godly hate lies; the wicked come to shame *

*and disgrace. Godliness helps people all through life, *

*while the evil are destroyed by their wickedness. *(Pro. 13:5-6)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Godly living will safeguard your life. Every choice for good

sets into motion other opportunities for good. Evil choices

follow the same pattern, but in the opposite direction.

Each decision you make to obey God’s Word will bring a

greater sense of order to your life, while each decision to

disobey will bring confusion and destruction. The right

choices you make reflect your integrity. Obedience brings

the greatest safeguard and security.

*Pastor Sather*

*I pray that I will always follow your Word so that my live *

*will reflect my love for You. **Amen.*
