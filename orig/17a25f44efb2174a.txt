*My Verses:*

*Do not do as the wicked do, or follow the path of evil-*

*doers. Avoid their haunts. Turn away and go some-*

*where* *else, for evil people cannot sleep until they have*

*done their evil deed for the day, *(Pro. 4:14-16a)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Even friends can make you fall. It is difficult for people

to accept the fact that friends and acquaintance may lure

them to do wrong. Young people want to be accepted, so

they would never confront or criticize a friend for wrong

plans or actions. Many other people can’t see how their

friend’s actions could lead to trouble. While we should

be accepting of others, we need a healthy skepticism

about human behavior. When you feel yourself being

heavily influenced, proceed with caution. Don’t let your

friends cause you to fall into sin.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Heavenly Father I pray that I may glean true*

*wisdom while choosing new friends. . . **Amen*
