*Today’s Verses:*

*Raise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus **Christ, the Father of
compassion and the God of **all comfort, who comforts us in all our
troubles, **so we can comfort those in any trouble with the **comfort we
ourselves receive from God. *(2 Cor. 1:3,4)



*Today’s Reflection:*

We often receive special blessings from our gradchildren, which in many
cases are like the blessing Jesus sends us. When we open our Bibles, words may
jump off the page, that are exactly what we need to hear. A song may open
our heart and stir us to

worship. A friend may call or text or email

with an encouraging note. In either of these cases we should recognize that
Jesus is pouring out His love to us. This is His compassion acknowledging our
hurt which will never belittle us. *His tenderness*

*helps us receive His grace, and His strength **empowers us to endure and
offer His comfort to **others.*

* Pastor Sather*
