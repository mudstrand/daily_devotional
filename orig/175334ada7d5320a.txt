*Today’s Verse:*

*I am writing to all of you who share the same precious faith we have,
faith given to us by Jesus Christ, our God and Savior, who makes us right
with God.. *(2 Pet. 1:2)



*Today’s Reflection:*

If our faith is real, it will be evident in our godly behavior. If people
are diligent in Christian growth, they won’t backslide or be deceived by
false teachers. Christian growth is essential. It begins with faith and
culminates in love for others. To keep growing we need to know God, keep on
following Him, and remember what He taught us. We must remain diligent in
faithful obedience and Christian growth.



Christians need discernment to be able to resist false teachers. God can
rescue us from their lies *if* *we stay true to His Word the Bible, and
reject those who distort the truth.*

* Pastor Sather*
