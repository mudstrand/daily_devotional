*Today’s Verse:*

*For** the poor, every day brings trouble; for the happy heart, *

*life is a continual feast. *(Pro. 15:15)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Our attitudes color our whole personality. We cannot always

choose what happens to us, but we can choose our attitude toward

each situation. The secret to a happy heart is filling your mind with

thoughts that are pure, and lovely, with thoughts that dwell on the

good things in life (Phil. 4:8). This was Paul’s secret as he faced

imprisonment, and it can be ours as we face the struggles of daily

living. Look at your attitudes and then examine what you allow to

enter your mind and what you choose to dwell on. You may need to

make some changes.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Lord, help me focus my mind on what is good and pure, *

*I pray in Jesus’ name. **Amen. *
