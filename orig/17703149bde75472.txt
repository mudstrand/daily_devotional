*Today’s Verse:*

*I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring
and hers; He will crush your head., and you will strike His heel.” *(Gen.
3:15)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Let us thank God for frustrating the Devil’s plan

by faithfully keeping His promise to provide us

with a Savior, who in the Gospel is called the woman’s Seed or Offspring. A
great battle was

to take place between Satan and the Son of God,

and in this dead-ly duel Satan’s power would be crushed, but not without
wounds suffered by

Jesus. However, these were mere mortal wounds. After His human death, Jesus
rose again to life

and proclaimed His victory. Our Lord, “The Lion

of the tribe of Judah” (Rev. 5:5),once and for all overcame him who like a
roaring lion tried to

devour Christians, large and small. Since no one

is too small for Satan to pursue, no one is too insignificant for the
Savior to seek and to save.

Jesus Christ died for all.

*Let us thank God that we can rest assured *

*that Jesus** loves us, for the Bible tells us so!*
