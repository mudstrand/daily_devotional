*Today’s Verse:*

*To discipline and reprimand a child produces wisdom, but a mother is
disgraced by an undis-ciplined child. *(Pro. 29:15)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Parents of young children often grow weary of

disciplining them. They feel that all they do is

nag, scold, and punish. When you’re tempted to

give up and let your children do what they want,

or when you wonder if you’ve ruined every

chance for a loving relationship with them,

remember that kind, firm correction helps

them learn, and learning makes them wise

Consistent, loving discipline will ultimately

teach them to discipline themselves.

* Pastor Sather*

*Dear Lord help me see clearly when our *

*children need my advice. **Amen.*
