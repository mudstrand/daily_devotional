*Today’s Verses:*

*Wrongdoers listen to wicked talk; liars pay attention*

*to destructive words. Those who mock the poor indult*

*their Maker; those who rejoice at the misfortune of*

*others will be punished. *(Pro. 17:4, 5)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Few acts are as cruel as making fun of the less fortunate,

but many people do this because it makes them feel good

to be better off or more successful than someone else.

Mocking the poor is mocking the God who made them.

We also ridicule God when we mock the weak, those

who are different, or anyone else. When you catch your-

self putting others down just for fun, stop and think about

who created them.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me if I should ever make *

*cruel statements about those who are less fortunate than *

*I. **Amen.*
