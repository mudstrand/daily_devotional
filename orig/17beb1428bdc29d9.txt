*Today’s Verse:*

*the wise have wealth a luxury, but fools spend *

*what- ever they get. *(Pro. 21:20)



*Today’s Reflection:*

This proverb is about saving for the future. Easy

credit has people living on the edge of bankruptcy.

The desire to keep up appearances and to accum-

ulate more, drives them to spend every penny they

earn, and they stretch their credit to the limit. But

anyone who spends all he has is spending more than

he can afford. A wise person puts money aside for

hard times. God approves of foresight and restraint.

God’s people need to examine their life-style to

see whether their spending is God-pleasing or merely

self-pleasing.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Heavenly Father, help me to do some honest*

*self-searching, and make any correction I need to*

*make. **Amen.*
