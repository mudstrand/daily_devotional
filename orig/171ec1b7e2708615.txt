*Today’s Verse:*

*Then God said, **“Let us* * make people in our image, to be **like
ourselves. They will be masters **over all life—the fish **in the sea, the
birds in the sky, and all the livestock, wild*

*animals, and small animals.” *(Gen. 1:26)



*Today’s Reflection:*

I believe it is important that we take note of the fact that God uses the
plural form when speaking about the creation of mankind. Knowing that we
are made in God’s image and

so share many of His characteristics provides a solid basis for self-worth.
Human worth *is not* based on possessions, achievements, physical
attractiveness, or public acclaim. *Instead*, it is based on being made in
God’s image. Because

we bear God’s image, we can feel positive about ourselves*.* *Criticizing
or downgrading ourselves is criticizing what **God has made and the
abilities He has given us.*

* Pastor Sather*
