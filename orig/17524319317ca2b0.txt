*Today’s Verses:*

*Truly if they had called to mind that country from which they had come
out, They** would have found a way to go back—BUT they were looking for a
better place,** a heavenly **homeland. THAT is why God is not ashamed *

*to be called their God, **for He has prepared a heavenly city for
them. *(Heb.
11:15-16)



*Today’s Reflection:*

These people of faith died without receiving all that

God had promised, *but* they never lost their vision of heaven (“A better
place, a heavenly homeland”). Many

Christians have become frustrated and defeated because their needs, and
wants, expectations, and demands are

not immediately met when they accept Christ as Savior.

They become impatient and want to quit. Are you discour-aged because the
achievement of your goals seems far away? Take* courage from these heroes **of
faith, who lived and died without seeing the fruit of their faith *

*on* *earth **and* * yet continued to believe. (for further insight look at
Heb. 11:36-39)*
