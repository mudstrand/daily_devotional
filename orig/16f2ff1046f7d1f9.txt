*But decorate what you do have!*


*Todayâ€™s Thoughts: *(12-23-2019)

If we go out to seek joy, it will elude us, If

we go out to impart joy, we will find it.This

Christmas, whether you have little or much,

it makes no difference. It is your attitude that

counts. *Make Christmas a blessing for those *

*who have less then you.*

* Pastor Sather*
