*Today’s Verse:*

(To the woman who anointed Jesus’ feet) *Jesus said*

*to the woman,**“Your faith has saved you; go in peace.” *(Lk. 7:50)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Overflowing love is the natural response to forgive-

ness and the appropriate consequence of faith. But

only those who realize the depth of their sin can appre-

ciate the complete forgiveness God offers them. Jesus

has rescued all of His followers, whether they were

once extremely wicked or conventionally good from

eternal death. But the Pharisees believed that only

God could forgive sins, so they wondered why this

man Jesus was saying that the woman’s sins were forgiven. They did not
grasp the fact that Jesus was

indeed God. *Do you appreciate the **wideness of *

*God’s mercy? Are you grateful for His **forgiveness? *
