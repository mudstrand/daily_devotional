*Today’s Verses:*

*Don’t worry yourself trying to get rich. Why waste*

* your time? For riches can disappear as though they*

* had the wings of a bird! *(Pro. 23:4, 5)



*Today’s Reflection:*

I think that we have all heard of people who have

millions of dollars and then lost everything. Even

the average person can spend an inheritance—or

a paycheck—with lighting speed and have little to

show for it. Don’t spend your time chasing fleeting

earthly treasures. Instead, store up treasure in heaven,

for such treasures will never be lost. (read Lk. 12:33,

34 for Jesus’ teaching.)

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Lord, as I think of myself and others who*

*claim Christ as their Savior I Pray that each of *

*us would refuse to let the world squeeze us into *

*its mold, and refuse to imitate it as it seeks every-*

*thing to live with and nothing to live for. **Amen. *
