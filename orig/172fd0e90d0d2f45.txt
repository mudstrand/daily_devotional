*Today’s Verse:*

*The strength of those who wait with hope in the Lord **will be renewed.
They will run and won’t become weary. **They will walk and won’t grow
tired. *(40:31)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Experience is a good teacher. We are confident that: They who wait for the
Lord shall renew their strength, they

shall mount up with wings like eagles.

They shall run and not grow weary, they shall walk and not faint.

When it is put like that, it is easy to see the advantage of growing
older rather than shrinking younger. In the spiritual realm, *who would
want *his faith to grow

weaker day by day? Who would want to see his Christlike qualities diminish
with the passing of time? Who would want

to give up the personal experiences where

God has proven his faithfulness time and again in one’s own life? *Not Me!*

* Pastor Al*
