*Verse for Today:*

*Like newborn babies, crave spiritual milk, so that*

*by it you may grow up in your salvation. *(I Pet. 2:2)



*What Is Needed in This Life:*

The people the apostle addressed in his letter were

New Christians. Spiritually speaking they were babies.

A good beginning had been made, but newcomers in

the faith need to grow. As we should see the apostle

clearly explained how spiritual growth comes about.

The proper nourishment for beginners is the *“pure*

*spiritual milk,” *the simple Word of God. It teaches

that all people are sinners and that Jesus Christ is their

only Savior: and are redeemed by the precious blood

of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect (I Pet. 1:18-19)

*Our calling is to be Christians who daily grow in the*

*knowledge and faith of Christ.*

*Pastor Al*
