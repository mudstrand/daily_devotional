*Today’s Verses:*

*Why is life given to those with no future, those destined *

*by God **to live in distress? I can not eat for sighing; my groans pour **out
like water. What I always feared has happened me.What I **dreaded has come
to be. I have *

*no peace, no quietness. I have **no rest; instead, only trouble comes. *(Job.
3:23-26)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Job had been careful not to worship material possessions but to worship God
alone. Here he was overwhelmed by calamities that mocked his caution, and
he complained about trials thatcame despite his right living. All the
principles by which he had lived were crumbling, and

Job began to lose his perspective. Trials and grief,

whether temporary or enduring, do not destroy the real purpose of life.
Life is not given merely for happiness

and personal fulfillment but for us to serve and honor

God. *The worth and meaning of life is based **on the *

*one reality no one can take away—God’s love **for us.*

* Pastor Sather*
