*Today’s Verses:*

*He isn’t here! He has risen from the dead! Don’t you *

*remember** what He told you back in Galilee, that the *

*Son of Man must be** betrayed into the hands of sinful *

*men and be crucified, and that **He would rise again *

*on the third day?” *(Lk. 24:6-7)


*Today’s Reflection:*

*Why is the Resurrection important?*

(1) Because Christ was raised from the dead we know

that our world is now headed for redemption not disaster.

(2) Because of the Resurrection, we know that death

has been conquered and we, too, will be raised from the

dead to live forever with Christ.

(3) Because the Resurrection gives authority to the

church’s witness in the world.

(4) Because the Resurrection gives meaning to the

church’s sacrament of the Lord’s Supper.

(5) Because the Resurrection gives meaning even

in great tragedy

(6) Because the Resurrection assures us that Christ

is alive and ruling His kingdom, He is alive and well.

*(7) **God’s power that brought Jesus back from *

*the dead **is available to us so that we can live for *

*Him in the evil world.*
