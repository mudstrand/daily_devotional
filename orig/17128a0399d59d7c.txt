*Today's Verses:*

*“You shall have no other gods before Me. You shall not make **for yourself
a carved image.” *(Exodus 20:3-4b)


*Today's Reflection:*

Read these two verses once again. Don't you think that we should be
concerned?

GOD DEALING* WITH TODAY’S IDOL WORSHIP*

In three short months just like God did with the plagues In Egypt, God has
taken away everything we worship. We are

known for the worship of athletes, so I will

Shut down your stadiums. We worship our musicians, I will shut down your
Civic Centers. We worship actors, I will shut down the theaters. We worship
money, I

will shut down the economy and crush the stock market. You don’t want to go
to church and worship me, I will make it so

you can’t go to church. If my people

called by my name will humble them-

selves and pray and keep the faith, and turn from their wicked ways, then I
will hear them from heaven and forgive their

sins and heal their land. Maybe we don’t need a vaccine*!* maybe instead we
should take the time to avoid the distractions of the world *and have a
personal revival where we focus **on the only thing in the world that
really matters, Jesus **Christ. ** Pastor Sather*
