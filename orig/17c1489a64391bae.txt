*Today’s Verses:*

*Do not rob the poor because they are poor or exploit *

*the needy in court. For the Lord is their defender. He *

*will injure anyone who injures them. *(Pro. 22:22, 23)



*Today’s Reflection:*

These verses are a message of hope to people who must work

under unjust domineering leaders. It is also a warning to those

who enjoy ruling with an iron hand. Sometimes God intervenes

and directly destroys tyrants. More often though He uses other

rulers to overthrow them or their own oppressed people to rebel

against them. If you are in a position of authority in church, work,

or home, remember what happens to tyrants. Leadership through kindness is
more effective and longer lasting than leadership by force.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Lord, help me remember that if I ever come into some role *

*of authority, You will remind me that You are truly our leader. *

*Amen. *
