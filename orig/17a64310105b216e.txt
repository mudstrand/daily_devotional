*My Verse:*

*Fear of the Lord is the beginning of true wisdom*

*knowledge of the Holy One results in understand-*

*ing. *(Pro. 9:10)



*Todayâ€™s Reflection:*

Are you a mocker or a wise person? You can tell

by the way you respond to criticism. Instead of

replying with a quick put-down or a clever retort

when being rebuked, listen to what is being said.

Learn from your critics, this id the path to wisdom.

Wisdom begins with knowing God. He gives

insight into living because He created life. To

know God you must not just know the facts about

Him; you must have a personal relationship with

Him. Do you really want to be wise? Get to know

God better and better. (see James 1:5) for more on

how to get to know Him better.

*Pastor Sather*

*My prayer is to gain a personal relationship with*

*You my loving Heavenly Father. Amen.*
