*Today’s Verse:*

*If you refuse to discipline your children, it proves you don’t *

*love them, if you love your children, you will be prompt *

*to discipline them. *(Pro. 13:24)



*Today’s Reflection:*

It is not easy for a loving parent to discipline a child, but it

is necessary. The greatest responsibility God gives parents is

the nurture and guidance of their children. The lack of discip-

line puts parent’s love in question because it shows a lack

of concern for the character development of their child-

ren. Disciplining children averts long-range disaster. With-

out correction children, grow up with no clear understanding

of right and wrong, and with no direction to their lives. Don’t

be afraid to discipline your children. It is an act of love.

Remember, however, that your efforts can not make

your children wise, they can only encourage your children to

seek God’s wisdom.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Heavenly Father, help us to remember to pray that our children
have l**ooked
to you for Your wisdom. **Amen.*
