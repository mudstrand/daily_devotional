*Today’s Verse:*

*Zeal without knowledge is not good; a person who *

*moves to quickly may go the wrong way. *(Pro. 19:2)



*Today’s Reflection:*

The Bible provides a sound basis for enthusiasm, in

other words (zeal). Paul states it this way, ”*and *

*whatever you do, do it heartedly, as to the Lord.*

(Col. 3:23)—Some people verbalize their inability

to be enthusiastic. I don’t believe there is a person

who hasn’t been enthusiastic about something. A

raise in salary, an award, vacation, promotion, birth

of a child, opportunity, or some other event in life

that creates zeal by its very nature. What we need

in the church is enthusiasm for the mission God has

given His people. This will guarantee peak perfor-

mance.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Heavenly Father, keep me from rushing into*

*the unknown. I pray that I would always realize*

*what I am getting into, in my zeal to follow You.*

*Amen. *
