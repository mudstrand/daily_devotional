*Today’s Verse;*

*You adulterous! Don’t you realize that friendship *

*with the world makes you an enemy with God\? *

*I say it again, that if you aim is to enjoy this world, you can’t be a
friend of God. **what do you think *

*the Scriptures mean when they say that the Holy Spirit whom God has placed
within us, jealously longs for us to be faithful? *(Jm. 4:4, 5)



*Today’s Reflection:*

The cure for evil desires is humility (see Pro.

16: 18, 19) Pride makes us self-centered and

leads us to conclude that we deserve all we

can see, touch, or imagine. It creates greedy

appetites for far more then we need. We can

be released from our self-centered desires by humbling ourselves before
God, realizing that

all we really need is His approval. When the

Holy Spirit fills us, we see that this world’s

seductive attractions are only cheap substitutes

for what God has to offer.

*Pastor Sather*

*Remember, pleasure that keeps us from *

*pleasing God is sinful; pleasure from God’s *

*rich bounty is good.*
