*Today’s Verse:*

*Pride goes before destruction, and haughtiness before a fall. *

(Pro. 16:18)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Proud people take little account of their weakness and do not

anticipate stumbling blocks. They think they are above the frailties

of common people. In this state of mind they are easily tripped up.

Ironically, proud people seldom realize that pride is their problem,
although everyone around them is well aware of it. Ask someone

you trust whether self-satisfaction has blinded you to warning signs.

He or she may help you avoid a fall.

* Pastor Sather*

*O Lord of all wisdom, please correct any problem I may have that would
draw me from Your righteous right hand. **Amen.*
