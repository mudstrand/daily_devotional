*Today’s Verse:*

*“Stop judging others, and you will not be judged.for others will treat you
as you treat them. Whatever measure you use in judging others, it will be
used to measure how you are judged.” *(Mt 7:1-2)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Jesus tells us to examine our own motives and con-duct instead of judging
others. The traits that bother us in others are often the habits we have
ourselves. Our bad habits and behavior patterns are the very ones that we
most want to change in others. Do you find it easy to magnify other’s
faults while excusing your own? If you are ready to criticize someone,
check to see if you deserve the same criticism. *Judge yourself first, and
then lovingly forgive and help your neighbor. *

* Pastor Sather *
