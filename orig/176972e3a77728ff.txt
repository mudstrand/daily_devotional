*Today’s Verse:*

*The people who waked in darkness have seen a *

*Great Light. *(Isa. 9:2)



Today’s Reflection:

In a time of great darkness, God promised to send

a light who would shine on everyone living in the

shadow, in the shadow of death. He is both

“Wonderful Counselor” and “Mighty God.” This

message of hope was fulfilled in the birth of Christ

and the establishment of His eternal kingdom. He

came to deliver all people from their slavery to

sin. Because of this Christmas, there has been born

a time of gift giving. But, really, Christmas is a gift

itself, the never-failing reminder that, no matter

what, God is with us every step of our journey

through this life. (GOD BE WITH YOU AND YOURS

IN THE COMING YEAR, WITH ALL THE QUESTIONS

LOOMING IN LIFE.)
