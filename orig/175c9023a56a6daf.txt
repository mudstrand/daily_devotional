*Today’s Verses:*

*If anyone says, “I am living in the light,” but hates a *

*Christian brother or sister, that person is still living in *

*darkness. Anyone who loves other Christians is living *

*in the light and does not cause anyone to stumble. *

*Anyone who hates a Christian brother **or sister is walk-*

*ing in darkness. Such a person is lost, having been blinded *

*by the darkness.* (I Jn. 2:9-11)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Does this mean that if we dislike some-one we are not a Christian? These
verses are not talking about disliking a disagreeable Christian brother or
sister. There will always

be people we will not like as well as others. John’s words

focus on the attitude that causes us to ignore or despise

others, to treat them as irritants, competitors, or enemies.

Christian love is not a feeling but a choice. We can choose

to be concerned with people’s well-being and treat them

with respect, whether or not we feel affection toward them.

*If we choose to love* *others, God **will help us express our love.*
