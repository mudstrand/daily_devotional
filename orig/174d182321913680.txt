*Today’s Verse**s:*

(The disciples fear of the storm) “Teacher, don’t

you even care that we are going to drown?” When

He woke up, He rebuked the wind and said to the

water, “Quiet down.” Suddenly the wind stopped,

and there was a great calm. And He asked them,

“why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith

in Me?” (Mk. 5:38b-40)


*Today’s Reflection**:*

The disciples panicked because the storm threatened

to destroy them all, and Jesus seemed unaware and unconcerned. Theirs was a
physical storm, but storms

also come in other forms. Think about the storms in

your life—the situations that cause you great anxiety. Whatever your
difficulty,
you have two options; you

can worry and assume that Jesus no longer cares, or

you can resist fear putting your trust in Him.

*When you feel like panicking. confess your need *

*for God and**then trust Him to care for you.*
