*Today’s Verses:*

*Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful *

*or** proud or rude. Love does not demand its own way. *

*Love is** not irritable, and it keeps no record of when it *

*has been** wronged. It is never glad about injustices but *

*rejoices **whenever the truth wins out. Love never gives *

*up, never** loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures *

*through every** circumstance. Love will last forever. *

*(I Cor. 13:4-8a)*


*Today’s Reflection:*

I believe we have all seen that our society often

confuses Love and lust. Unlike lust, God’s kind

of love is directed outward toward others not in-

ward toward ourselves. It is utterly unselfish. This

kind of love goes against our natural inclinations.

It is impossible to have this love unless God helps

us set aside our own natural desires so that we can

love and not expect anything in return. *The more *

*we* * be**come like Christ, the more love we will *

*show to others.*
