I once made a remark about the hidden books of the Bible. It was a
lulu. Kept people looking so hard for the facts and for others it was a
revelation. Some were in a jam, especially since the names of the books
were not capitalized, but the truth finally struck home to numbers of
readers. To others it was not a real job. We want it to be a most
fascinating few moments for you. Yes, there will be some real easy ones to
spot. Others may require judges to help them. I will quickly admit it
usually takes a minister to find one of them, and there will be a loud
lamentations when it is found. A little lady says she brews a cup of tea so
she can concentrate better. See how well you can compete. Relax now for
there really are sixteen names of books in the Bible in this story.
