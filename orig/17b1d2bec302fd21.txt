*Today’s Verse:*

*Foolishness brings joy to those who have no sense; a sensible *

*person stays on the right path. Plans go wrong for lack of advice;*

*many counselors bring success. *(Pro. 15:21, 22)



*Today’s Reflection:*

People with tunnel vision*,* those who are locked into one way of

thinking*, *are likely to miss the right road because they have closed

their minds to any new options. We need the help of those who

can enlarge our vision and broaden our perspective. Seek out the

advice of those who know you and have a wealth of experience*.*

Build a network of advisers. Then be open to new ideas, and be

willing to weigh their suggestions carefully. Your plans will be

stronger and more likely to succeed.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Heavenly Father, help me to weigh carefully the advice and*

*suggestions of those who have had more experience in life. **Amen.*
