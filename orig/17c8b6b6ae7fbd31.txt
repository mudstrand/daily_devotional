*Today’s Verses:*

*O God, I beg two favors from You before*

* I die. First, help me to never tell a lie. *

*Second, give me neither poverty nor riches! *

*Give me just enough to satisfy **my needs.*

(Pro. 30:7-8)


*Today’s Reflection:*

Having to much can be dangerous, *but* so can

having too little. Being poor can, in fact, be ha-

zardous to spiritual as well physical health. On

the other hand, being rich is not the answer. As

Jesus pointed out, rich people have trouble get-

ting into God’s kingdom (Mt. 19:23,24). Like

Paul, we can learn how to live whether we have

little or a lot (Phil. 4:12), but our lives are more

likely to be effective if we have neither poverty

or riches.

*Dear Lord, my prayer is like that of the writer of *

*these two verses. I ask two favors of You before I *

*die. First, help me to never tell a lie. Second, give *

*me neither poverty nor riches! Give me just enough *

*to satisfy my needs. **Amen.*
