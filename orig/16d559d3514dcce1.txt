*Verse for Today:*

*The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent*

*called the devil, who leads the whole world astray. *(Rev. 12:9)



*Thoughts for Today:*

In my human reasoning, I believe Satan struck in the Garden

of Eden first to get even with God for throwing him out of

heaven. For this he became an avid enemy of God, he could

not avenge himself on the Lord. So Satan turn to Adam and

Eve, the very crown of creation whom God had made in His

own image. As we all know he hasn’t quit yet: “the whole

world is under the control of the evil one” (I Jn. 5:19). Take

note of this, *the world is given over to all the fruits of the *

*flesh:* “sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry

and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish

ambition, dissension, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies,

and the like” (Gal. 5:19-21). All the while Satan tempts people

to the *greatest* sin of all—UNBELIEF. *BUT CHRIST PAID IT ALL*

*ON THE CROSS.*
