*Today’s Verse:*

*Whoever turns a sinner from the error of *

*his way **will save him from death and over *

*a multitude of** sins. *(Jm. 5:20)



*Today’s Reflection:*

The book of James emphasizes faith in

action. Right living is the evidence and

result of faith.The church must serve with compassion, speak lovingly and
truthfully,

live in obedience to God’s commands and

love one another. The body of believers

ought to be an example of heaven on earth,

drawing people to Christ through love for

God and each other. If we truly love God’s Word, we will live it day by
day. God’s

Word is not merely something we read or think about, but something we
do. *Belief,
faith,* *and trust must **have hands and *

*feet—ours!*

* Pastor Sather*

*Give thanks to God for every sinner who repents **and believes in Jesus as
Savior.*
