*Today’s Verses:*

*Remember, no one who wants to do wrong should **ever say, “God is tempting
me.” God is never **tempted to do wrong, and He never tempts anyone **else
either. *(14) *Temptation comes from the lure of **our *

*own **desires.* (brought about by Satan)



*Today’s Reflection:*

This is why I have to confess that I have a problem with the Lord’s Prayer!
I can no longer pray “*lead**us not** into temptation.” *I now pray, “*Do
not allow us** be led into temptation by Satin.” *I do believe a lot

of people who live for God often wonder why they still have temptations.
Does God tempt them? God tests people, *but* He does not tempt them by trying
to seduce them to sin. However, God, does allow Satin to tempt people, in
order to refine

their faith and to help them grow in their dependence upon Christ. *We can
resist the temptation **to sin by turning to God for strength and **by
choosing to obey His Word.*

* Pastor Sather*
