*Today’s Subject: HIS UNLIMITED LOVE *(Ps. 117)



*Today’s Verse: *

*Praise the Lord, all you nations. Praise Him, all you *

*people of **the earth. For He loves us with unfailing *

*love; the faithfulness **of the Lord endures forever. *

(Ps. 117:1-2)



*Today’s Thoughts:*

Have you ever heard someone say, “I can’t think of anything God has done
for me, how can I praise Him?"

This psalm gives two reasons for praising God: *first* His

His unfailing love toward us, *second* His faithfulness endures forever.
*If* He did nothing else for us, He would

still be worthy of our highest praise. *God’s salvation is *

*available for all people who believe in Him, **not just*

* the Jews.*
