*Verse for Today:*

*Lord, my heart is not proud; my eyes are not haughty. I donâ€™t*

*concern myself with matters to great or awesome for me. But*

*I have stilled and quietened myself, just as a small child is*

*quiet with his mother. Yes, like a small child is my soul within*

*me. *(Ps. 131:1-2)



*Thought for Today:*

Pride results from overvaluing ourselves above others.

It results in restlessness because it makes us dissatisfied

with what we have and concerned about what everyone

else is doing. It keeps us hungering for what others have.

By contrast, humility puts others first and allows us to be

content with God leading our lives. Such contentment

gives us security so that we no longer need to prove our-

selves to others.

*Let humility and trust affect your perspective **and give*

*you the strength and freedom to **serve God and others.*

* Pastor Al*
