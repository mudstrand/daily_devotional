*Today’s Verse:*

*Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord; behold Lord,*

*half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have*

*taken any thing from any man by false accusation,*

*I will restore to him fourfold. *(Lk 19:10)

(read Lk. 19:1-10)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Everyone knew that tax collectors were becoming rich

by gouging their fellow Jews. No wonder the people

muttered when Jesus went home with Zacchaeus, the

tax collector. But despite the fact that Zacchaeus was

both a cheater and a turn coat, Jesus loved him, and

in response the tax collector was converted. In every

society, certain groups of people are considered

“untouchable” because of their political views, their

immoral behavior, or their life style.

*Jesus loves them and they need to hear the Good *

*News.*

Remember the words we pray, “forgive us our trespasses *as we* forgive
those who trespass against us.



Remember too Mt. 7:1 “Judge not that you be not judged.”

*Pastor Al*
