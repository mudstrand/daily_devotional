*Today's Verse: *
*For You make me glad by Your deeds, Lord; I sing for joy*
*at what Your hands have done. *(Ps. 92:4)
*Today's Thought:*
I've always thought you can see the hand of God best with
our hindsight. Looking back it is easier to understand why He
placed us in the home that He did; why He brought certain
people and circumstances into and out of our lives. In my own
life, I get a lot of clarity (though not perfect) about the wise and
loving ways of God as I reflect on the ways He has managed my journey by
"What God's have done" (Ps. 92:4). Looking ahead,
though, is not always so clear. Have you ever had that lost feeling
when the road ahead seems twisted, foggy and scary? Before you
move into life's next big adventure, stop and look into the rear view
mirror of days gone by, and joyfully realize that God meant it when
He said, "Never will I leave you, never will I forsake you." So we can say
with confidence, "The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid"
(Heb. 13:5-6) *With the promise of God's presence and help in mind, we can
move ahead with utmost confidence.*
