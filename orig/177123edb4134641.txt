*Today’s Verses:*

*The chief priests . . . gave the soldiers a *

*large sum of money, telling them, “You are*

* to say, ‘His disciples came during the night and stole Him away while we
were asleep.” *(Mt. 28:12-13)

*Today’s Reflection:*

The government had taken extra measures

to seal the tomb Jesus had been placed in.

A government seal had been placed on the entrance, and guards were
stationed at the tomb. But these precautions back-fired.

They were in and of themselves, proof that

the circulated story of the theft of Jesus’

body was a lie.

Now the soldiers had said the body had been stolen by the disciples
while they

slept, if they were asleep how did they

know it was the disciples. Further, when

we consider how frightened the disciples

were, we would have to believe they were

the least likely candidates for grave rob-

bery.

The truth is simply this: “Christ has indeed been raised from the
dead” (I Cor. 15:20) *AND, * He was delivered over to

death for our sins and was raised to life

for our justification.” (Ro. 4:25)

*THE TRUTH PREVAILS.*
