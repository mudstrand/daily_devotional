*Todayâ€™s Verse:*

*All the while praising God and enjoying the good will*

*of all the people. And each day the Lord added to*

*their group those who were being saved. *(Acts 2:47)



*My Reflection:*

A healthy Christian community attracts people to

Christ. A healthy, loving church will grow in

numbers. *What are you doing to make your *

*church the kind of place that attracts others *

*to Christ?*

* Pastor Sather*
