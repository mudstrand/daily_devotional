*Today’s Verse:*

*“I will place on His shoulder the key to the house *

*of David; what He opens no one can shut, and *

*what He shuts no one can open.” *(Isa. 22:22)



*Today’s Reflection:*

You will find this verse quoted in Rev. 3:7 by John.

As the one who *possesses* all power in heaven and

on earth Jesus exercises His power to delegate autho-

rity by entrusting to His disciples the office of the

Keys: the authority to retain the sins of the impenit-

ent and to remit the sins of those who repent and

believe in Jesus as Savior. This is the power the

church exercises through the public ministry: it is

the power to close and to open heaven.

*Let us thank the Lord Jesus, the head of the *

*church for having given His followers the power*

* to forgive.*



*Let us also remem**ber to pray for our Government Officials.*

* Pastor Sather *
