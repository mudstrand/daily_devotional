*Today’s Verses:*

*Godly Jews from many nations were living in Jerusalem *

*at that time. When they heard this sound they came running *

*to see what it was all about, and they were amazed to here*

*their language being spoken by the believers. They were*

*beside themselves with wonder. “How can this be?” they*

*exclaimed these people are all from Galilee, and yet we*

*hear them speaking in the language of the lands where*

*we were born? *(Acts 2:5-8)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Christianity is not limited to any race or group of people.

Christ offers salvation to all people without regard to

nationality. Visitors in Jerusalem were surprised to hear

the apostles and other believers speaking in languages

other than their own, the languages of other nationalities,

but they didn’t need to be, because God works all kinds

of miracles to spread the Good News, using many lang-

uages as He calls all kinds of people to become His

followers. *No matter what your race, color or nation-*

*ality or language, God speaks to you. Are you listen-*

*ing **to Him?*
