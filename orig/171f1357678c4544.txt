*Today’s Verse:*

*Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you. *(1 Pet. 5:7)




*Today’s Reflection: *It is easy today to fall into the trap of anxiety
with the dangers of the *virus* that has become so prevalent. But carrying
your worries, stresses, and daily struggles by yourself shows that you have
not trusted God fully with your life. It takes humility, however, to
recognize that God cares. To admit your need, and let others in

God’s family help you, BUT sometimes we think that struggles are caused by
our own sin and foolishness are not God’s concern. *But* when we turn to
God in repentance, He

will bear the weight even of those struggles. Letting God have your
anxieties calls for action, not passivity. *Don’t submit* *to circumstances
but to the Lord who **controls *

*circumstances. *
