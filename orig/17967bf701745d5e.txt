*Verse:*

*My dear brothers and sisters, how can you claim *

*to have **true faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ *

*if you favor** some people more than others? *

(Jm. 2:1) read (Jm. 2:1-7)



*Today’s Reflection: *

James condemns acts of favoritism. Often we

treat people who are better off, then we do those

who are poor. I’m afraid we often do this because

we would rather be identified with successful

people than with apparent failures. James reminds

us that the supposed winners may have gained

their impressive lifestyle at our expense. We may also notice that the rich
often find it hard to ident-

ify with the Lord Jesus, who came as a humble

servant. Are you easily impressed by status,

wealth, or fame? Are you partial with the “have” while ignoring the “have
nots”? This attitude is sinful. God views all people as equals, And *IF*

He favors anyone, it is the poor and powerless…

*Pastor Sather*

*We should follow Christ's example.*
