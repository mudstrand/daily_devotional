*Today’s Verses:*

*As the time drew near for His return to heaven, Jesus resolutely **set out
for Jerusalem. Jesus sent messengers ahead *

*to a Samaritan village to prepare for His arrival. But they were turned
away. The people of the village refused to have any-thing to do with Jesus
because He had resolved to go to Jerusalem. *

(Lk. 9:51-53)

*Today’s Reflection:*

Even though Jesus knew He would face persecution and death in Jerusalem, He
was determined to go there. Christ’s love for us compelled Him to go there.
That kind of resolve should characterize *our* life too. When God gives us
a course of action, we must move steadily toward our destination, no matter
what potential hazards await us there. *Let us stretch ourselves to do
something that requires a sacrifice.*

* Pastor Sather*
