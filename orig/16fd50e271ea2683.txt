*Today’s Verse:*

*He took our sickness and removed our diseases. *

(Mt. 8:17)



*Today’s Reflection:*

There are times when the answers to my prayers don’t

come as quickly as I want them to, but it still surprises

me when I experience instant relief from Jesus. The

N.T. is filled with stories of how Jesus showed compassion to those who
were suffering, and often

they received their healing immediately. Whatever

the circumstances you should remember Jesus cares

for all of us—men, women, young, old, privileged,

and underprivileged. Jesus was crucified on the cross

for the forgiveness of our sins and the healing of our sicknesses and
diseases. In faith we can cry out to Him

and expect His healing touch. The pain may be gone

right away as it has happened to me at various times,

or the healing may come much latter. But one thing is

certain, Jesus is always concerned with our well-being.
