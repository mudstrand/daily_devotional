*Verses for Today: *

*It is by grace you have been saved. *(Eph. 2:8)



*Thoughts for Today:*

Here is a thought that passes our understanding. It has

to do with our relationship between God’s universal

grace—the fact that God wants all people to be saved

(I Tim. 2:4)—and salvation by God’s grace alone. If God

predestines and gives the power to believe, why doesn’t

He do this for all? Perhaps in eternity we will understand.

In the mean-time let us faithfully adhere to the truths of

salvation God has revealed in His Word. Let us remember

we are all sinners, incapable of self-salvation. To save us,

God sent His Son to redeem us, and He continues to send

His Holy Spirit to create and confirm faith in us. *How *

*thankful we should be for the work God has performed *

*in us and through us proclaims it to others.*
