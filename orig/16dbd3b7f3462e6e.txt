*Verse for Today:*

*You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to **accomplish what
is now being done, the saving of many lives. * (Gen, 50:20)



*Thoughts Relating to This Verse:*

God has a way of turning human errors so it fulfills His will. This truth
clearly emerges from the story of Joseph in the Old Testament, where his
brothers because of their jealousy sold him into slavery. Through this act
Joseph rose from slavery into leadership.

Turning to the New Testament, we see even more clearly how God turned the
hatred of Jesusâ€™ enemies into the good of mankind, turning the brutal
crucifixion into the once-for-all sacrifice of His Son. While God carries
out His will, the evildoers are still accountable to Him for their sins.

*Let us praise our Lord for all His blessings to us.*
