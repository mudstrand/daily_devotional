*Today’s Verses:*

*Happiness or sadness or wealth should not keep anyone **from doing God’s
work. Those in frequent contact with **the things of the world should make
good use of them *

*without **becoming attached to them, for *

*this world and **all it contains will pass-away. *(I Cor. 7:30-31)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Paul urges believers not to regard marri-age, home, or financial security
as the ultimate goals of life. As much as poss-ible, we should live
unhindered by the cares of this world, not getting involved with burdensome
mortgages, budgets, investments, or debts that might keep

us from doing God’s work. A married

man or woman, as Paul points out (7:33, 34) must take care of earthly
responsi-

bilities but make every effort to keep

them modest and manageable. *Ask Jesus to show you if **there are
possessions or activities that distract **you.*

* Pastor Sather *
