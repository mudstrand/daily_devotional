*Verse for Today:*

Jesus said: *“When you see a cloud rising in the west,*

*immediately you say, ‘it’s going to rain,’ and it does.”*

(Lk. 12:54)



*How Good Are We At Interpreting Signs?*

For most of recorded history, the world’s principal

occupation was farming. The farmer depended

directly on the weather for his livelihood. He needed

just the right amount of sunshine and rain, to make

his living, and he grew skilled at interpreting natural

signs. Jesus was announcing an earthshaking event

that would be much more important than the year’s

crops—the coming of God’s Kingdom. Just as dark

clouds forewarned of a rainstorm, there were signs

that the Kingdom would soon arrive. But Jesus’

hearer’s though skilled at interpreting weather signs,

were intentionally ignoring the signs of the times.
