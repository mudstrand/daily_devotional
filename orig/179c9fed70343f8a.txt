*Today’s Verse:*

*Remember, it is sin to know what you ought to *

*do and not do it. *(Jm. 4:17)

*Today’s Reflection:*

We tend to think that doing wrong is sin. But

James tells us that, sin is also not doing right.

(these two kinds of sin are sometimes called

sins of commission and sins of omissions.)

It is a sin to lie, it can also be a sin to know

the truth and not tell it. It is a sin to speak

evil of someone; it is also a sin to avoid that

person when you know he or she needs your friendship. You should be willing
to help as

the Holy Spirit guides you. If God has directed

you to do a kind act, to render a service, or to

restore a relationship, *do it.*

*Pastor Sather*

*If you do so, you will experience a renewed *

*and refreshed vitality to your Christian faith.*
