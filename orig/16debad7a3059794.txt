*Verse for Today:*

*As Jesus and His disciple … were leaving the city,*

*a blind man, Bartimaeus … was sitting by the*

*roadside begging. *(Mk. 10:46)



*Thoughts Regarding This Verse:*

Everyone of us, at one time or another, experience

some kind of distress. If it isn’t a physical disability

it is something else: financial worries, health concerns,

career challenges, loneliness, or any number of other

challenges. *But* there is help and hope. We are greatly

blessed to have Jesus, Helper and Healer, come our

way. The Savior, having made us His own, comes our

way on the feet of human messengers: friends, family,

and fellow Christians in whose hearts the love of God

is working. The question before every Christian should

be: *How can we be a messenger for Christ to people*

*in need.*

* Pastor Al*
