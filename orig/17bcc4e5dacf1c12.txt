*Today’s Verse:*

*The Lord despises double standards; He is not pleased *

*by dishonest scales. *(Pro 20:23)



*Today’s Reflection:*

“Dishonest scales” refers to loaded scales a merch-

ant might use in order to cheat customers. Dishonesty

is a difficult sin to avoid. It is easy to cheat if we think

no one is looking. But dishonesty affects the very core

of a person. It makes him untrustworthy, and untrusting.

It eventually makes him unable to know himself or re-

late to others. Don’t take dishonestly lightly. Even the

smalllest portion of dishonesty contains enough of the

poison of deceit to kill your spiritual life. If there is any

dishonesty in your life, tell God about it now.

*Dear Heavenly Father, I** pray for Your forgiveness *

*if I have wounded any soul today by any false state-*

*ment** or dealings. Amen. *
