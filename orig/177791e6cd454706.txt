*Subject: THE INDWELLING GOD *

(2-7-21)



*Today’s Verse:*

*I pray that from His glorious, unlimited resources He will give you His
might *

*inner strength through His Holy Spirit. *

*And I pray that Christ will be more and *

*more at home in your hearts as you trust *

*in Him. May your roots go down deep *

*into the soil of God’s marvelous love. *

(Eph. 3:16-17)



*Today’s Reflection:*

The Bible teaches the indwelling of the

Triune God in believers. This divine indwell-

ing in Christians is totally different from

pagan enthusiasm, however.The apostles

clearly stated that God’s presence in

our hearts comes “through faith.” This

faith in the atoning merit of Jesus Christ

as our Savior. It is created and sustained

only through means of grace: Word and

sacraments. It is not based on human

feelings or emotions but on the truths of

God’s Word.

*We need to pray that the Father, Son, *

*and Holy** Spirit, will dwell within us *

*to strengthen us for** the mission of the church. *
