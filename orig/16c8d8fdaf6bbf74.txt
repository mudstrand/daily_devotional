*Verse for Today:*
*But they soon forgot what they had done and did not wait for His plan to
unfold. *(Ps. 106:13)

*Thought for Today:*
How many of us have been guilty of praying only in a crisis. How many of us
have a *"Quick fix" *mentality that sees God mainly as a problem solver.
*And* when merciful solutions come, He is courteously thanked, then more
or less forgotten until the next crisis. If you read Psalm 106: 1-15 you
will see that it contains a serious warning against dismissing God from our
lives--as if that was possible. Anticipate great things from God, but don't
expect Him to come at your beck and call. *Instead, *be at His beck and
call, eager to fulfill His will. Ask God to accompany you through life's
dark pathways. *But* instead of dismissing Him when your special needs are
met, cling to Him as if your life depended on it. *It does! REMEMBER GOD
IS NOT A VENDING MACHINE. . .*
