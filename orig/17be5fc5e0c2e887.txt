*Subject: KNOWING THE CORRECT PATTERN *



*Today’s Verses:*

*A simpleton can learn only by seeing mockers punished;*

*a wise person learns from instruction. The Righteous *

*One knows what is going on in the homes of the wicked; *

*He will bring the wicked to disaster. *(Pro 21:11, 12)

*Today’s Reflection:*

It is usually better to learn from the mistakes of others

than from your own. We can do this by listening to

their advice. Take counsel from others instead of plung-

ing ahead and learning the hard way.

*Pastor Sather*

*Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that you would give me*

*the wisdom* *to follow-after Your pattern. Amen.*
