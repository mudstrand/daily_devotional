*Today’s Verses:*

*He told them,“I saw Satan falling from heaven*

* as **a flash of lightening! And I have given you *

*all the power of the enemy, and you can walk *

*among** snakes and scorpions and crush them. Nothing **will injure you.
But don’t rejoice just *

*because **evil spirits obey you; rejoice because *

*your **names are registered as citizens of heaven.”*

(Lk. 10:18-20)


*Today’s Reflection:*

Jesus may have been looking ahead to his victory over Satan at the cross.
Jn. 12:31, 32, indicates

that Satan would be judged and driven out at the

time of Jesus’ death. On the other hand, Jesus may have been warning His
disciples against pride. Perhaps He was referring to Isa. 14:12-17, which
begins, “How you are fallen from heaven, O shin-

ning star, son of the morning!” Some interpreters identify this verse with
Satan and explain that

Satan’s pride led to all evil we see on earth today.

To Jesus’ disciples, who were thrilled with their power over evil spirits
(“snakes and scorpions”),

He may have been giving this stern warning;

*“Yours is the kind of* *pride that led to Satan’s downfall. Be careful!”*

* Pastor Saher*

*Let us thank God for giving us the victory over*

*Satan through Jesus Christ our Lord.*
