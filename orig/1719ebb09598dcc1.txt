*Today’s Verse:*

*. . .Teaching **them to Observe all I have commanded you. **And, low, I am
with you always.* (Mt. 28:20)



*Today’s Reflection:*

*Teaching. *Disciples are made not only through baptism, but through the
ongoing work of the church. *Observe all. *Here

Christians are called to do more than “*obey”; *they are called to treasure
God’s Word in their hearts. *Commanded,* not only by Christ’s moral (law)
but also

His invitation to trust Him (the Gospel). *I am with you **always. *He is
present especially in His church and congregation on earth as Mediator,
Head, King, and

High Priest. This presence is not a part, or only one half of Him. Christ’s
entire person is present, to which both of His

natures belong, the divine and the human—not only according to His
divinity, but also according to, and with, His revealed human nature. *End
of the age. *Is when

He returns visibly. *We must make Jesus King **of our life and worship* *Him
as our Savior, King, and **Lord.*
