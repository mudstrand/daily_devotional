*Today’s Verse:*

*Don’t just pretend you love others. **Really love them!*

*Hate what is wrong. Stand on the side of good. *(Ro. 12:9)



*My thoughts Today:*

Most of us have learned to be courteous to others—

how to speak kindly. Avoid hurting their feelings,

and appear to take interest in them. We may even

be skilled in pretending to show compassion when

we hear of others’ needs, or to become indignant

when we learn of injustice. BUT God calls us to

real and sincere love that goes beyond being hypo-

critical and polite. Sincere love requires concentra-

tion and effort. It means helping others become

better people. It demands our time, money, and

personal involvement. No individual has the cap,

acity to express love to a whole community, but

the body of Christ in your town does. *Look for*

*people who need your love, and look for ways*

*you and your fellow believers can love your*

*community for Christ.*

* Pastor Sather*
