*Today’s Verse:*

*“While your servant was busy here and *

*there, **the man** disappeared.” *(I Kings 20:40)



*Today’s Reflection:*

According to the account in I Kings, a

prophet told King Ahab a fictitious story.

He said he had been guarding a prisoner,

but he had been negligent “busy here and there” and the prisoner had
escaped. The

lesson was meant to get Ahab’s attention because he had let his enemy,
King Ben-Hadad
of Syria, escape. Many people

leave the important tasks of life undone

because they are preoccupied with the

trivial things of life, thus the big picture escapes them. Jesus Christ
came into the

world and into our hearts on the bridge

of faith built by the Holy Spirit, through the Gospel, for the purpose of
saving us

from sin and death.The Redeemer took

our attention away from the trifles of the world, from man’s gaudy lights
which keep

us from seeing God’s Sun, in our pursuit of selfish interests and from
being “busy here and there.” Instead, He wants us to focus

our attention on the treasures of His Word

and the joy of serving Him in His Kingdom. *Ask Jesus, **your **priceless
Treasure, your truest Friend, to keep **you **always near Him.*
