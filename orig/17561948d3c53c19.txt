*Today's Verses:*
*Not even a sparrow worth only half a penny, can fall to the ground*
*without your Father knowing it. and the very hairs of your head are*
*all numbered. So don't be afraid; you are more valuable to Him*
*than a whole flock of sparrows. *(Mt. 10:29-31)

*Today's Reflection:*
Jesus said that the Father is aware of everything that happens even
to sparrows, and you are far more valuable to Him then they are.You
are so valuable that He sent His only Son to die for you (Jn. 3:16).
Because God places such value on you, you never need fear personal
threats or difficult trials. these can't shake God's love or dislodge His
Spirit from within you. But this doesn't mean that God will take away
all your troubles. (see 10:16). The real test of value is how well some-
thing holds up under the wear, tear, and stress of everyday life. *Those*
*who stand up for Christ in spite of their troubles truly have lasting*
*value and will receive great rewards. *(see 5:11, 12)
