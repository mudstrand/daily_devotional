*Today’s Verse:*

*Then they prayed, “Lord . . . show us which *

*of **these two you have chosen to take over *

*this apostolic **ministry, which Judas left.” *

(Acts 1:24-25) read (Acts 1:12-26)



*Today’s Reflection:*

Our Lord did, in fact, appoint a successor

to Judas, the apostle Matthias, but He did it through the church. Christ
still carries

out His work through church members,

under the Spirit’s guidance, they proclaim

the Gospel and administer the sacraments.

It is through His disciples today that He

fulfills His purposes.Christians cannot die

for the salvation of others nor can they

create faith in them, but they do have the

responsibility of telling the world that,

“In [Christ] we have redemption through

His shed blood, the forgiveness of sins”

(Eph. 1:7). We have the authority—as did

the 120 disciples in the Upper Room—to

call pastors and teachers to do Christ’s

work, serving *together *in His kingdom.

* Pastor Sather*

*Thank the Lord for guiding its members through **His means of grace.*
