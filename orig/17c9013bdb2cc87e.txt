*Today’s Verses:*

*Charm is deceptive, and beauty does not last, but a woman *

*who fears the Lord will be greatly praised. Reward her for *

*what she has done. Let her deeds publicly declare her praise. *

(Pro. 31:30-31)



*Today’s Reflection:*

The book of Proverbs begins with the command to fear the

Lord (1:7) and ends with the picture of a woman who fills

this command. Her qualities are mentioned throughout the

book: hard work, fear of God, respect for spouse, foresight,

encouragement, care for other, concern for the poor, wisdom

in handling money. These qualities, when coupled with coup-

led with the fear of God lead to enjoyment, success, honor

and worth. Proverbs is practical for us because it shows how

to become wise, make good decisions, and live according to

God’s ideal.

*Pastor Sather*

*I thank You for what I have learned by going through the *

*book of Proverbs. Help me to live according to the guidance *

*that has been pre**sented in this book. **Amen.*
