*Today’s Verses:*

*Dear brothers and sisters, whenever trouble comes your way, let it be an
opportunity for joy. For when your faith *

*is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow. *

(Jm. 1:2-3)



*Today’s Reflection:*

James doesn’t say *if* trouble comes your way *but* whenever it does. He
assumes that we will have

troubles and that it is possible to profit from them.

The point is not to pretend to be happy when we

face pain but to have a positive outlook (“ let it be

an opportunity for joy”) because of what troubles

can produce in our life James tells us to turn our

hardships into times of learning. *Tough times can *

*teach us perseverance.*

* Pastor Sather*
