*Today’s Verse:*

*“It’s for freedom that Christ has set us free*. *Stand firm, then, **and
do not let yourselves be burdened again by the *

*yoke of **slavery” *(Gal. 5:1)



*Today’s Reflection:*

The Declaration of Independence was a political document with a somewhat
religious orientation. It declared that all

people were “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,”
including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

Liberty and freedom are still in our vocabulary. Citizens have the duty and
privilege to uphold the principles men-tioned in the Declaration of
Indepen-dence. Civic freedom needs to be pre-served. This document was not
conceived in a vacuum. It was profoundly influ-

enced by the tenets of the Christian faith. *We must not bargain our
Christian faith **away but stand firm on it. Let us give thanks to God
for **the
freedom we enjoy as citizens.*

* Pastor Sather.*
