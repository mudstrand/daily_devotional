Today's Verses: Ps. 31:1-2

In you, O Lord, do I take refuge; let me never be put to shame; in your
righteousness deliver me! 

2 Incline your ear to me; rescue me speedily! Be a rock of refuge for me, a
strong fortress to save me! 

Today's Thoughts:

David called upon God to deliver him. He wanted God to stop 

those who were unjustly causing trouble. David made his request 

based upon what he knew of God's name or character. 



In times like these God alone is our comfort and strength. 

Even when we are too weak to fight, we can lean on Him.

Often it is when we recognize our weakness that God's 

greatest strength becomes available. 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, strengthen my faith through Your Word 

so that I can stand in heaven's victory circle. . . Amen.
