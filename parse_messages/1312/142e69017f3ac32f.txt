Today's Verses: Ps. 31:14-16

But I trust in you, O Lord; I say, "You are my God." 15 My times are in your
hand; 

rescue me from the hand of my enemies and from my persecutors! 

16 Make your face shine on your servant; save me in your steadfast love! 

Today's Thoughts:

When David said, "My future is in Your hands," he was expressing his belief
that 

all of his life's circumstances were under God's control. Knowing that God
loves 

and cares for us enables us to keep steady in our faith regardless of our
circumstances.

It keeps us from sinning foolishly by taking matters into our own hands or
resenting Gods 

timetable. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, remove the fear of my sinful heart. Fill it with joy because of my
Saviors birth.

Restore to me a steady faith regardless of my circumstances. . . Amen.

Love the Lord, all you his saints! The Lord preserves the faithful but 

abundantly repays the one who acts in pride. Psalms 31:23
