Today's Verses: Ps. 33:18-20

But the Lord watches over those who fear him, those who rely on his
unfailing love.

He rescues them from death and keeps them alive in times of famine. 
We put our hope in the Lord. He is our help and our shield. 

Today's Thoughts:

This is not an ironclad guarantee that all believers will be delivered from
death 

and starvation. Thousands of Christians have been beaten to death, whipped, 

fed to lions or executed. God can (and often does) miraculously deliver His 

followers from pain and death. But sometimes, for purposes known only to 

Him, he chooses not to. When faced with these harsh realities, we must focus


on the wise judgments of God. In time of crises, we can still place our hope
in God.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, forgive me for the times I have doubted Your wisdom. 

Give me patience to wait on Your timing. . . Amen
