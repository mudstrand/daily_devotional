Today's Verses: Ps. 33:4, 5

For the word of the Lord holds true, and we can trust everything He does.

He loves whatever is just and good; the unfailing love of the Lord fills the
earth. 

Today's Thoughts:

How many times have you gotten a guarantee that was not worth the paper it
was written on?

Well we need not worry about God's promises because all of God's words are
true and trustworthy.

The Bible is reliable because unlike people, God does not lie, forget,
change His words, or leave

His promises unfulfilled. We can trust the Bible because it contains the
words of a holy, trustworthy, 

and unchanging God. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

I thank You Lord, that Your Words holds true-

and that we can trust everything that You do.

I thank You for Your unfailing love. . . Amen.



Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

Trust in the Lord with all your heart; do not depend on your own
understanding.

Seek His will in all you do, and He will show you which path to take. Pro.
3:5-6 (NLT)
