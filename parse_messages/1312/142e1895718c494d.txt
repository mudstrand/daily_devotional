Today's Verses: Ps. 31:11-13

Because of all my adversaries I have become a reproach, especially to my
neighbors, 

and an object of dread to my acquaintances; those who see me in the street
flee from me. 

12 I have been forgotten like one who is dead; I have become like a broken
vessel. 

13 For I hear the whispering of many- terror on every side!- as they scheme
together 

against me, as they plot to take my life. 

Today's Thoughts:

In describing his own feelings, David writes of the helplessness and
hopelessness every

one feels when hated or rejected. But adversity is easier to accept when we
recognize 

our true relationship with our heavenly God. Although our enemies may seem
to have 

the upper hand, they are ultimately the helpless and hopeless ones. Those
who know 

God will be victorious in the end-We can have courage today because God will
preserve us. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Lord, for Your peace through Jesus, I thank You.

Help me sleep well because of it. . . Amen.



Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

Lead me, O Lord, in Your righteousness because of my enemies; 

make Your way straight before me. Psalms 5:8
