Today's verses: Ps. 27:9-10

9 Do not hide Your face from me. Do not angrily turn me away. You have been
my help. Do not leave me!

Do not abandon me, O God, my Savior! 

10 Even if my father and mother abandon me, the Lord will take care of me. 

Today's Thoughts:

Many have had the sad experience of being abandon by their father and
mother. 

Broken homes, difference of belief, addiction to drugs or alcohol-and the
list goes on.

These things can cause children to feel isolated and crippled. Even as
adults, the pain may linger.

God can take that place in our life. He can fill that void, and heal that
hurt. He can direct us to 

adults who may take the role of a father or mother for us. His love is
sufficient for all our needs. 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, teach me how to live, lead me in paths of righteousness. . . Amen.





Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

It is always good to start the day with prayer!
