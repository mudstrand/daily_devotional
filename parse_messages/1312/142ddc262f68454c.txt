The Lord's Ballgame




THE LORD'S BASEBALL GAME



Freddy and the Lord stood by to observe a baseball game. The Lord's team was
playing Satan's team.

The Lord's team was at bat, the score was tied zero to zero, and it was the
bottom of the 9th inning with two outs. They continued to watch as a batter
stepped up to the plate named 'Love.'

Love swung at the first pitch and hit a single, because 'Love never fails.'

The next batter was named Faith, who also got a single because Faith works 

with Love.

The next batter up was named Godly Wisdom. Satan wound up and threw 

the first pitch. 


Godly Wisdom looked it over and let it pass: Ball one. Three more pitches
and Godly Wisdom walked because he never swings at what Satan throws.


The bases were now loaded. The Lord then turned to Freddy and told him He
was now going to bring in His starplayer. Up to the plate stepped Grace. 

Freddy said, 'He sure doesn't look like much!'



Satan's whole team relaxed when they saw Grace.
Thinking he had won the game, Satan wound up and fired his first pitch. 

To the shock of everyone, Grace hit the ball harder than anyone had ever
seen! 

But Satan was not worried; his center fielder let very few get by. 





He went up for the ball, but it went right through his glove, hit him on the
head and 

sent him crashing on the ground; the roaring crowds went wild as the ball
continued over the fence . . for a home run! 


The Lord's team w n!

The Lord then asked Freddy if he knew why Love, Faith and Godly Wisdom 

could get on base but couldn't win the game. Freddy answered that 

he didn't know why.



The Lord explained, 'If your love, faith and wisdom had won the game, you
would think you had done it by yourself. Love, Faith and Wisdom will get you
on base but only My Grace can get you Home: 



'For by Grace are you saved, it is a gift of God; not of works, lest any man
should boast.' Ephesians 2:8-9

Psalm 84:11, 'For the Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord will give grace
and glory; no good thing will He withhold from those who walk uprightly.' 

Jesus' Test 

This is an easy test; you score 100 or zero. It's your choice. 

If you aren't ashamed to do this, please follow the directions. 

Jesus said, 'If you are ashamed of me, I will be ashamed of you before my
Father.'

Not ashamed!! Pass this on, if you mean it..
, I do Love God. He is my source of existence and Savior. He keeps me
functioning each and every day. Without Him, I am nothing, but with him:

'I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.'
Phil 4:13



This is the simplest test . . If you Love God, and are not ashamed of all
the great things He has done for you, 

send this to a few friends.
