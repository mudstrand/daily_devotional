Today's Verses: Ps. 32:4, 5

4 For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was dried up as
by the heat of summer. 

5 I acknowledged my sin to you, and I did not cover my iniquity; I said, "I
will confess my transgressions 

to the Lord," and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. 

Today's Thoughts:

To confess our sins is to agree with God, acknowledging that He is right 

to declare what we have done as sinful and that we are wrong to desire 

or to do it-is to affirm our intensions of forsaking that sin, in order 

to follow Him more faithfully.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, in this incomplete world, assure me daily 

of my complete forgiveness in You. . . Amen
