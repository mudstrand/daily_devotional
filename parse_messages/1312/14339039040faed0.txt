Today's Verses: Ps. 34:9, 10

9 Let the Lord's people, show Him reverence, for those who honor Him will
have all they need.

10 Even strong young lions sometimes go hungry, but those who trust in the
Lord will lack no good thing. 

Today's Thoughts:

You say you belong to the Lord, but do you show reverence to Him?

To reverence the Lord means to show deep respect and honor to Him.

We demonstrate true reverence by our humble attitude and genuine worship.



We also need to remember that God knows what we need, and our deepest needs
are spiritual.

Many Christians, even though they face unbearable poverty and hardship still
have enough 

spiritual nourishment to live for God. David was saying that if you have God
you have all 

you really need. God is enough.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, forgive me for complaining about what I don't have, when all I
really need is You. . . Amen.
