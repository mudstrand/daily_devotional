Today's Verse: Ps. 34:1

I will praise the Lord at all times. I will constantly speak His praises.

Today's Thoughts:

Do you always feel like giving thanks? Not me but we can take heart, 

because in all things God works for our good if we love Him and are 

called by Him (Ro 8:28). We need not thank God for our problems but 

for the strength He is building in us through the difficult experiences 

of our life. We can be sure that God's love will see us through. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, thank You for Your grace in choosing me. I thank You 

that You know what I need to help me grow in the faith I need to 

deal with the problems of this life. Fill my heart with the joy of salvation
. . Amen.

Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

Let your gentleness be evident to all.

The Lord is near. . . Phil. 4:5
