Today's Verses: 30:6, 7

I said in my prosperity, "I shall never be moved." 7 By Your favor, O Lord, 

You made my mountain stand strong; You hid Your face; I was dismayed. 

Today's Thoughts:

Security had made David feel invincible. Although he knew his riches and 

power had come from God, they had gone to his head, making him proud.

Wealth, power, and fame usually have an intoxicating effect on people, 

making them feel self-secure, and independent from God. But this false 

security can be easily shattered.

Don't be trapped by the false security of prosperity. Instead depend on 

God for your security, and you won't be shaken when worldly possessions 

disappear. 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, Help me never to fall into the trap of trusting in worldly
possessions.

Help me to keep my focus on You and the true security that You promise to
all 

who have placed their life in Your hands. . . Amen. 



Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

Create in me a pure heart, O God.

Ps. 51:10
