Today's Verse: Ps. 28:5 
Because they do not regard the works of the Lord or the work of His hands, 
He will tear them down and build them up no more. 
Today's Thoughts:
One could say these people were two-face by what we see in verse 3 
"They were friendly to their neighbors while planning evil in their hearts."
We really need to think about our attitude, oh and our pleasures-if they 
do not have God's blessing-they just may destroy us. 
Leaving God out of or life will allow sin to come in. God wants us to enjoy
life-
but to avoid those activities that could lead us away from Him.
Today's Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, stand at my side and keep me standing beside 
You every one of my days. . . Amen.

Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather
Keep My commandments in your heart, for they will prolong your life many
years.
Pro. 3:12
