Today's Verses: Ps. 33:10-12

The Lord frustrates the plans of the nations and thwarts all their schemes.

But the Lord's plans stand firm forever; his intentions can never be shaken.

What joy for the nation whose God is the Lord, whose people he has chosen as
his inheritance. 

Today's Thoughts:

"The Lord's plans stand firm." Have you ever been frustrated by the
inconsistences of others, 

our nation, and even yourself? God is completely trustworthy-His intentions
never change. 

There is a promise that whatever is good and perfect comes to us from the
Creator who never 

changes (James 1:17). When you begin to wonder if there is anyone you can
trust, remember 

that God is completely consistent. Let Him counsel you. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, I thank You that I can put my full confidence in You. I pray that
I would have a

Christ-like attitude in all my dealings with others. I pray that our nation
would once again

turn to You for Godly wisdom.In Jesus name-Amen.
