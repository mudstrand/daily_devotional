Today's Verses: Ps. 28:6, 7

6 Blessed be the Lord! For he has heard the voice of my pleas for mercy. 

7 The Lord is my strength and my shield; in him my heart trusts, and I am
helped; 

my heart exults, and with my song I give thanks to him. 

Today's Thoughts:

God is so responsive that you can always reach Him.

He bends down and listens to your voice.

Remember that God is near, listening carefully to every 

prayer and answering each one in order to give you His best.

As we understand the future He has for us, we will experience joy.

Don't base your life on circumstances, but on God. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, remind me day to day that You care

for me as one of Your family. . . Amen.



Pastor Al & Marcie Sather

I will thank the Lord because He is just;

I will sing praises to the name of the Lord Most High.
