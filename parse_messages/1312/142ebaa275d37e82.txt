Today's Verses: Ps. 31:23-24

23 Love the Lord, all you his saints! The Lord preserves the faithful but
abundantly repays the one who acts in pride. 

24 Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all you who wait for the
Lord! 

Today's Thoughts:

What David is assuring God's faithful people, is that He preserves or keeps
His faithful safe.

But the Lord despises pride and so there will be a penalty for them to
pay-Living in this world 

can be stressful so He says, "Be strong-let your heart take courage." How do
we manage that?

We can manage that because the Lord preserves His faithful ones. . .

Let us remember vs. 3 of 'Amazing Grace' 

"Through many dangers, toils and snares, I have already come; tis grace 

hath brought me safe thus far and grace will lead me home"- and everyone
said Amen.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, help me sing loudly of Your amazing love and 

what it has done for me in Jesus. . . Amen.
