HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Get rid of anything that isn't useful, beautiful or joyful...

Our Meditation for Today:

And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of
the body of Jesus Christ once for all...

Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties;
again and again he offers the same sacrifice, which can never take
away sins...

But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, 
He sat down on the right hand of God...(Heb. 10:10-12) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Christ's work is contrasted with the work of the Jewish priests.
The priests' work was never finished, so they had to stand day
after day and offer sacrifices; Christ's sacrifice (dying in our place) 
is finished, so He is seated...

The priests repeated the sacrifices often; Christ sacrificed once for all.
The sacrifice system couldn't completely remove sin; Christ's sacrifice
effectively cleansed us...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the sacrifice Christ made
for me on the cross. I thank You for the cleansing power of His
shed blood. I pray that one day soon all would come to the know-
ledge of this truth...Dear Lord, watch over our troops, and protect 
them from the dangers that they encounter each and every day...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
