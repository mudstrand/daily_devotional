Holy ABCs

Although things are not perfect 
Because of trial or pain 
Continue in thanksgiving 
Do not begin to blame 
Even when the times are hard 
Fierce winds are bound to blow 
God is forever able 
Hold on to what you know 
Imagine life without His love 
Joy would cease to be 
Keep thanking Him for all the things 
Love imparts to thee 
Move out of "Camp Complaining" 
No weapon that is known 
On earth can yield the power 
Praise can do alone 
Quit looking at the future 
Redeem the time at hand 
Start every day with worship 
To "thank" is a command 
Until we see Him coming 
Victorious in the sky 
We'll run the race with gratitude 
Xalting God most high 
Yes, there'll be good times and yes some will be bad, but... 
Zion waits in glory...where none are ever sad! 

Love and peace be with you forever, Amen.
