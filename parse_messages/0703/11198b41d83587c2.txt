Ok, I didn't look to see if the last thing was true; however, all of the reminders on how to handle situations are good, and we can never be reminded enough!




Crucial

Because of recent abductions!

in daylight hours, refresh yourself

of these things to do

in an emergency situation...

This is for you,

and for you to share

with your wife,

your children,

everyone you know.

After reading these 9 crucial tips,

forward them to someone you care about.

It never hurts to be careful

in this crazy world we live in.



1. Tip from Tae Kwon Do:

The elbow

is the strongest point

on your body.

If you are close enough to use it,

do!

2. Learned this from a tourist guide

in New Orleans

If a robber asks

for your wallet and/or purse,

DO NOT HAND IT TO HIM

Toss it away from you....

chances are

that he is more interested

in your wallet and/or purse

than you,

and he will go

for the wallet/purse.

RUN LIKE MAD IN THE OTHER DIRECTION!

3. If you are ever thrown

into the trunk of a car,

kick out the back tail lights

and stick your arm out the hole

and start waving like crazy.

The driver won't see you,

but everybody else will.

This has saved lives.



4. Women have a tendency

to get into their cars after shopping,

eating, working, etc.,

and just sit (doing their checkbook,

or making a list, etc.

(DON'T DO THIS!)

The predator

will be watching you,

and this is the perfect opportunity

for him to get in

on the passenger side,

put a gun to your head,

and tell you where to go.

AS SOON AS YOU GET INTO YOUR CAR,

LOCK THE DOORS AND LEAVE.

a. If someone

is in the car

with a gun

to your head

DO NOT DRIVE OFF,

repeat:

DO NOT DRIVE OFF!

Instead gun the engine

and speed into anything,

wrecking the car.

Your Air Bag will save you.

If the person is

in the back seat

they will get the worst of it .

As soon as the car crashes

bail out and run.

It is better than having them

find your body

in a remote location.

5 A few notes about getting

into your car in a parking lot,

or parking garage:

A.) Be aware:

look around you,

look into your car,

at the passenger side floor,

and in the back seat

B..) If you are parked next to a big van,

enter your car from the passenger door.

Most serial killers attack their victims

by pulling them into their vans

while the women are attempting

to get into their cars.

C..) Look at the car

parked on the driver's side

of your vehicle,

and the passenger side.

If a male is sitting alone

in the seat nearest your car,

you may want to walk back

into the mall, or work,

and get a guard/policeman

to walk you back out.

IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY. (And better paranoid than dead.)

6.. ALWAYS

take the elevator

instead of the stairs.

(Stairwells are horrible places

to be alone

and the perfect crime spot.

This is especially true at NIGHT!)

7. If the predator has a gun

and you are not under his control,

ALWAYS RUN!

The predator will only hit you

(a running target)

4 in 100 times;

And even then,

it most likely

WILL NOT

RUN,

Preferably !

in a zig -zag pattern!




8. As w omen,

we are always trying

to be sympathetic:

STOP

It may get you raped,

or killed.

Ted Bundy,

the serial killer,

was a good-looking,

well educated man,

who ALWAYS played

on the sympathies

of unsuspecting women.

He walked with a cane,

or a limp,

and often asked

"for help"

into his vehicle

or with his vehicle,

which is when he abducted

his next victim.

************* Here it is *******

9. Another Safety Point:

Someone just told me

that her friend heard

a crying baby on her porch

the night before last,

and she called the police

because it was late

and she thought it was weird.

The police told her

"Whatever you do,

DO NOT

open the door."

The lady

then said that

it sounded like the baby

had crawled near a window,

and she was worried

that it would crawl

to the street

and get run over.

The policeman said,

"We already have a unit on the way,

whatever you do,

DO NOT open the door."

He told her that they think

a serial killer

has a baby's cry recorded

and uses it to coax

women out of their homes

thinking that someone

dropped off a baby

He said they have not verified it,

but have had several calls

by women saying that

they hear baby's cries

outside their doors

when they're home alone

at night.

Please pass this on and

DO NOT

open the door

for a crying baby ----

This

e-mail should probably

be taken seriously because

the Crying Baby theory

was mentioned on

America 's Most Wanted

this past Saturday

when they profiled

the serial killer in Louisiana.

I'd like you

to forward this

to all the women you know.

It may save a life.

A candle is not dimmed

by lighting another candle.

I was going to send this to the ladies only,

but guys,

if you love your mothers,

wives,

sisters! ,

daughters, etc.,

you may want to

pass it onto them, as well.

Send this

to any woman you know

that may need

to be reminded

that the world we live in

has a lot of crazies in it

and it's better to be safe

than sorry
