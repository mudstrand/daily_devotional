MAY YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Get outside every day. Miracles are waiting everywhere...

Our Meditation for Today:

Then Christ would have had to suffer many times since 
the creation of the world. But now He has appeared once
for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the
sacrifice of Himself...(Heb. 9:26) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

All people have to die physically, but Christ died so that we 
would not have to die spiritually. We can have a wonderful 
confidence in His saving work for us, doing away with all our
sins...

The "end of the age" refers to the time of Christ's coming to
earth in fulfillment of the Old T. prophecies. Christ ushered
in the new era of grace and forgiveness...

We are still living in the "end of the age." The day of the Lord
has begun and will be completed at Christ's return...

Our Prayer for Today:
Most Gracious Heavenly Father, what a wonderful gift we have
received by Your grace, the gift of eternal life...Yet we wait dear 
Lord for the wonderful day when our Lord Jesus Christ will return
to usher us to our eternal home...I pray for a true revival in the hearts
of those who do not have the assurance of eternal life...I pray that
the Holy Spirit would be able to awaken those sleeping hearts...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
