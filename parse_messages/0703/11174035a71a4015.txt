HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Life is simpler when you plow around a stump.

Our Meditation for Today:

By faith we understand that the universe was formed at
God's command, so that what is seen was not made out
of what is visible...(Heb. 11:3) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

God called the universe into existence out of nothing; He declared
that it was to be, and it was...

Our faith is to be in the God who created the entire universe by His 
word. God's word has awesome power. When He speaks, do you 
listen and respond?

How can you better prepare yourself to respond to God's word???
We need to continually pray for sensitive hearts...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, great and awesome is Your power, 
in You I put my trust. Help me to be more sensitive and 
obedient to Your Holy Spirit's leading. Protect our troops 
from all danger. Be with the grieving families, give them a 
peace that passes all understanding, through Jesus Christ...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
