HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~If you don't ask, you don't get...

Our Meditation for Today:

For we know Him who said, "It is mine to avenge;
I will repay," and again, "The Lord will judge His
people."

It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the 
living God...(Heb. 10:30, 31) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

This judgement is for those who have rejected God's
mercy. For those who accept Christ's love and His
salvation, the coming judgement is no cause for worry...

Being save through His grace, they have nothing to fear.

There is no fear in love. but perfect love drives out fear, 
because fear has to do with punishment. the one who 
fears is not made perfect in love...(1 Jn. 4:18) 

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your loving-kindness.
I thank You that we can resolve all our fears first by focusing 
on Your immeasurable love for us, and then by allowing You
to love others through us. Your love O Lord stills my fears
and gives me confidence. Bless me e-mail friends with safety 
and good health...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
