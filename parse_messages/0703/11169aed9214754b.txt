HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Life isn't tied with a bow, but it is still a gift.

Our Meditation for Today:

Do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly
rewarded...

You need to persevere so that when you have done
the will of God, you will receive what he has promised.

For in just a very little while, "He who is coming will
come and will not delay...(Heb. 10:35-37) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

What we need to realize here is that we are encouraged not to
abandon our faith in times of persecution, and suffering but we 
must show our endurance and that our faith is real...

What faith is really all about is that we are resting in what Christ 
has done for us in the past, as well as what He will do for us in 
the present and the future...(see Ro. 8:12-25; Gal. 3:10-13)...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for your promise of adoption 
for all who put their faith in Christ. I thank You for what He did in
the past and what He is doing now and what he will do in the future.
Nothing that I have had to endure compares with the great price that
Christ paid to save me...Amen.

Keep looking up with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
