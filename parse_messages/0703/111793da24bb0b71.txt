HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Meanness don't just happen over night...

Our Meditation for Today:

By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did.
by faith he was commended as a righteous man, when 
God spoke well of His offerings. And by faith he still 
speaks, even though he is dead...(Heb. 11:4) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Cain and Abel were Adam and Eve's first two sons.
Abel offered a sacrifice that pleased God, while Cain's
sacrifice was unacceptable...

Abel's sacrifice (an animal substitute) was more acceptable 
to God, both because it was a blood sacrifice and, most
important, because of Abel's attitude when he offered it...

What is your attitude when you bring your offering to God?

Is it one of gratefulness because of what God has done for you?

Or do you give grudgingly and stingily???

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, give me a heart of love and compassion,
help me to always give not out of compulsion or grudgingly but
from a loving heart with gratitude...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
