HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~You can not unsay a cruel word...

Our Meditation for Today:

By faith Abraham, even though he was past age, and Sarah
herself was barren, was enabled to become a father because 
He considered him faithful who had made the promise.

And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came 
descendents as numerous as the stars in the sky and as
countless as the sand on the seashore...

All these people were still living by faith when they died. They
did not receive the things promised; They only saw them and
welcomed them from a distance. And they admitted that they 
were aliens and strangers on earth...(Heb. 11:11-13) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

We need to keep in mind that we are "foreigners and nomads."
This might be an awareness forced on us by circumstances.
It may come late in life or as a result of difficult times...

Yes this world is not our home, we cannot live here forever (I Pet 1:1).

It is best if we do not become so attached to this world's desires
and possessions that we can't move out at God's command...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, guide me in following the course 
You have laid out for me and all Your children. Keep us
mindful of the fact that we are truly aliens here. forgive me
when I become so attached to worldly possessions that I 
am not in tune with Your will. May I always look upon the 
gift of eternal life as the greatest possession I have been 
given so as to put that above all else...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
