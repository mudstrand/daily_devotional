HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~A real friend in one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out...

Our Meditation for Today:

Now faith is being sure of what we hoped for and
certain of what we do not see...(Heb. 11:1) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

The beginning point of faith is believing in God's character: 
He is who He says He is...

The end point is believing in God's promises:
He will do what He says...

When we believe that God will fulfil His promises even though
we don't see those promises materializing yet, we demonstrate
true faith (see Jn. 20:24-31)...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that I would continue to grow in faith
and not become a doubting Thomas. I thank You for the promise 
that on day I shall see Your physical presence, but until that time I 
thank you for the gift of the Holy Spirit...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
