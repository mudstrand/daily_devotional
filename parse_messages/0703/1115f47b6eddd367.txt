HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~All that truly matters in the end, is that you loved...

Our Mediation for Today:

Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, 
when you stood your ground in a great contest in the face of 
suffering...

Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution;
at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated.
(Heb. 10:32, 33) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

the Hebrews encouraged believers to persevere in their Christian
faith and conduct when facing persecution and pressure...

We don't usually think of suffering as being good for us, but it can
build our character and our patience...

During times of great stress, we may come to feel God's presence
more clearly and find help from Christians we never thought would care.

Knowing that Jesus is with us in our suffering and that He will return one 
day to put an end to all pain helps us grow in our faith and our relationship
with Him...(see Ro. 5:3-5)

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, It is difficult to give thanks during the time of suffering,
but I do thank You for using difficulties to cause me to grow in faith 
in You. I thank You for the promise of Your presence at all times. 
And I Thank You for the promise that one day You will return to gather
all believers to live with You in Paradise...
Bless and strengthen each of my e-mail friends...Amen

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
