HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~When you wallow with pigs, expect to get dirty...

Our Meditation for Today:

By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.

By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's
sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff...
(Heb. 11:20, 21) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Jacob was Isaac's son and Abraham's grandson.
Jacob's sons became the fathers of Israel's 12 tribes...

Even when Jacob (also called "Israel") was dying in
a strange land, he believed the promise that Abraham's 
descendents would be like the sand on the seashore
and that Israel would become a great nation...

True faith helps us see beyond the grave. 
True faith brings us to a personal relationship 
with Jesus Christ...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, I thank You for the promises that we 
find in Your Word. Help me Lord, to hold fast to
those promises as Jacob held fast to the promise
His grandfather Abraham had received...Bless our 
troops with good health and safety...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
