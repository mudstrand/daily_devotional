HAVE A GREAT DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Read the Psalms. They cover every human emotion...

Our Meditation for Today:

For Christ did not enter a man-made sanctuary that was
only a copy of the true one; He entered heaven itself, now 
to appear for us in God's presence...(Heb. 9:24) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Among references to priests, tabernacles, sacrifices, and other
ideas unfamiliar to us, we come to this description of Christ as
our Advocate, appearing in God's presence on our behalf...

We can relate to this role and be encouraged by it. Christ is on
our side at God's side. He is our Lord and Savior. 

He is not there to convince or remind God that our sins are forgiven 
but to present both our needs and our service for Him as an offering...(see Heb. 7:25).

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Christ's work as my Advocate.
I thank You for His role as my Lord and Savior. Accept my humble plea 
for forgiveness. Bless all my e-mail friends, keep them safe and healthy...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
