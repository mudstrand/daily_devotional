HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Don't audit life. Show up and make the most of it.

Our Meditation for Today:

First He said, "Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and 
sin offerings You did not desire, nor were You pleased with 
them" (although the law required them to be made).

Then He said, "Here I am, I have come to do Your will." He
sets aside the first to establish the second...(Heb. 10:8, 9) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Canceling the first covenant in order to establish a far better one 
meant doing away with the system of sacrifice contained in the 
ceremonial law. It didn't mean eliminating God's moral law (the
Ten Commandments).

The ceremonial law prepared people for Christ's coming. With 
Christ's death and resurrection, that system was no longer needed.

Now through Christ we can fulfill the moral law as we allow Him to
live in us...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the better covenant, that
you gave us through Your Son our Lord Jesus Christ. I thank
You that sacrifices are no longer needed. I thank You for the 
perfect sacrifice that was made in the death of our Savior. Give
me an obedient spirit that I may faithfully live in obedience to
Your Holy Spirit...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
