HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Yielding to the Master does not make one a slave...

Our Meditation for Today:

Because by one sacrifice He has made perfect forever
those who are being made holy...(Heb. 10:14) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

We have been made perfect, yet we are being made holy.
Through His death and resurrection, Christ, once for all,
made His believers perfect in God's sight...

At the same time, He is making them holy (progressively
cleansed and set apart, for His special use) in their daily
pilgrimage here...

We should not be surprised, ashamed, or shocked that we
still need to grow. God is not finished with us. we can encourage
this growth process by deliberately applying Scripture to all
areas of our life, by accepting the discipline and guidance Christ
provides, and by giving Him control of our desires and goals...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, in You a place my trust, that I may become
more perfect...I know that I still have a lot of growing to
do, so I place myself under Your control. Help me to
accept Your discipline and guidance I pray in Jesus
name Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
