04/27/2010~~~food for thought~~~ARE YOU REMAINING IN CHRIST?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Jesus said, "If a man remains in me and I in him,
he will bear much fruit." (Jn. 15:5)

Our Lesson for Today:
Remaining in Christ means:
(1) Believing that He is God's Son (I Jn. 4:15)
(2) Receiving Him as Savior and Lord (Jn 1:12)
(3) Doing what God says (I Jn. 3:24)
(4) Continuing to believe the Good News (I Jn. 2:24) and
(5) relating in love to the community of believers. (Jn. 15:12)

Many people attempt to be good, honest people who do what is right.
But Jesus says that the only way to live a truly good life is to stay close to Him,
like a branch attached to the vine ~ apart from Him our efforts are unfruitful. ~

Are you receiving the nourishment and life offered by Christ, the vine?
If not, you are missing a special gift He has for you...

Suggested Prayer:
Dear Lord, help me show my faith by the fruit in my daily life...Amen.

Sorry for not keeping up with the devotionals but I have been
at the Grand Forks Hospital where my mom is ~~~

I just came home to do my cousin's funeral ~ I will be returning 
to Grand Forks after the funeral...

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
