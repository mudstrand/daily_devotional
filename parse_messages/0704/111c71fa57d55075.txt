(Thank you, Connie

THANKS TO ALL WHO HAVE WALKED INTO MY LIFE, HAVING A MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE
PRAYING FOR ME IS A BLESSING!! Al.

The first sentence is pretty powerful.

God determines who walks into your life....it's up to you to decide who you 
let walk away,
who you let stay, and who you refuse to let go. I need this back. If you'll 
do this for me,
I'll do it for you....

Father, God bless all my friends in whatever it is that You know they may be 
needing this day!
And may their life be full of your peace, prosperity and power as they seek 
to have a closer
relationship with you. Amen.

Now send it on to five other people.
Within hours you caused a multitude of people to pray for other people.
Then sit back and watch the power of God work in your life.

P S. Five is good, but more is better, who else do you know that needs a 
prayer.
