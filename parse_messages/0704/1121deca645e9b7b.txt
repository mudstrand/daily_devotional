HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Opportunity may knock once, but temptation 
bangs on your front door forever.

Our Meditation for Today:

So we say with confidence, "The Lord is my helper;
I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?" (Heb. 13:6) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

We become content when we realize God's sufficiency
for our needs. Christians who become materialistic are
saying by their actions that God can't take care of them,
or at least that He won't take care of them the way they
want...

Insecurity can lead to the love of money, whether we are 
rich or poor. The only antidote is to trust God to meet all
our needs...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, help me to be content with 
what I have. Help me to grow in faith and trust in
You. You are my helper and comforter and I will 
not be afraid...

As we began this new week watch over my e-mail friends...Amen. 

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
