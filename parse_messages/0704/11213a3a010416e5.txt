HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~People are funny; they want the front to the bus,
the middle of the road, and the back of the church...

Our Meditation for Today:

Keep your lives free from the love of money, and be content 
in what you have, because God has said, "Never will I leave
you; never will I forsake you." (Heb. 13:5) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

How can we learn to be satisfied???

Well to begin with strive to live with less rather than desiring more;

give way out of your abundance rather than accumulating more;

relish what you have rather than resenting what you're missing...

See God's love expressed in what He has provided; 

and remember that money and possessions will all pass away...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, first of all I thank you for Your love.
I thank You for the gift of eternal life that Christ made possible
to all who believe in His finished work on the cross.
I thank You for my health, my home, my loving family, the food 
on my table each and every day. I thank you for everything you 
provide when I need it...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
