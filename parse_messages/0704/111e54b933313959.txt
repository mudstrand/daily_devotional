HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Good judgment comes from experience, 
and a lot of that comes from bad judgment...

Our Meditation for Today:

Therefore strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees.
Make level paths for your feet, so that the lame may not 
be disabled, but rather healed...(Heb. 12:12, 13) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

God is not only a disciplining parent but also a demanding 
coach who pushes us to our limits and requires our lives to 
be disciplined...

Although we may not feel strong enough to push on to victory, 
we will be able to accomplish it as we follow Christ and draw 
on His strength...

Then we can use our growing strength to help those around us 
who are weak and struggling...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, I thank You for the strength that I get through 
Your Word, for it is truly a lamp unto my feet, and a light
unto my path. I pray that I would always be faithful to
encourage others who are struggling...

Bless my e-mail friends with their greatest need today...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
