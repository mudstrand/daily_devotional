HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~It is easier the preach ten sermons
than to live one...

Our Meditation for Today:

Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot 
be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably 
with reverence and awe,

for our God is a consuming fire...(Heb. 12:28, 29) NIV 

Our Thought for Today:

There is a big difference between the flame of a candle
and the roaring blast of a forest fire. We cannot even 
stand near a raging fire...

Even with sophisticated fire fighting equipment, a consuming 
fire is often beyond human control...

God is not within our control either. We cannot force Him to 
even do anything for us through our prayers. He cannot be 
contained. Yet He is a God of compassion...

He has saved us from sin, and He will save us from death.
But everything that is worthless and sinful will be consumed
by the fire of His wrath...

Only what is good, dedicated to God, and righteous will remain...

Our Prayer for Today:
I thank You Lord for the promise that those who follow Your Son
will be a part of Your unshakable Kingdom, and they will withstand
the shaking, sifting, and burning. I thank You for the fact that what
ever happens here, a believers future is built on a solid foundation
that can not be destroyed...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
