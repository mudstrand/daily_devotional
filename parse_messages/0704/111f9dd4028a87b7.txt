HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Don't let your worries get the best of you; remember,
Moses started out as a basket case...

Our Meditation for Today:

See that no one is sexually immoral, or is godless like Esau, 
who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the
oldest son...

Afterwards, as you know, when he wanted to inherit this 
blessing, he was rejected. He could bring about no change 
of mind, though he sought the blessing with tears...(Heb. 12:16, 17) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

The story of Esau shows us that mistakes and sins sometimes
have lasting consequences (Gen. 25:29-34; 27:36).

Even repentance and forgiveness do not always eliminate sin's
consequences. How often have you made decisions based on
what you want now, rather than on what you need in the long run?

Stop and evaluate the long-range effects of your decisions and actions...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I do confess I have sinned and made many
mistakes in my decision making. I have made many decisions 
without seeking Your guidance first, and have had to suffer the 
consequences. Forgive me for my hasty decision making.
I pray that You would help me to see the long-range effects
of my all my decisions...

Bless and protect my e-mail friends...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
