HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(Food for thought)~~~Remember silence is sometimes the best answer...

Our Meditation for Today:

And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell
about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David,
Samuel and the prophets,

who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered 
justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the 
mouths of lions,

quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge 
of the sword: whose weakness was turned to strength;
and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign 
armies...(Heb. 11:32-34) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

We too can experience victory through faith in Christ. Our victories
over oppressors may be like those of the Old Testament saints,
but more likely, our victories will be directly related to the role God
wants us to play...

Even though our body deteriorates and dies, we will live forever 
because of Christ. In the promised resurrection, even death will
be defeated, and Christ's victory will be made complete...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the fact that Christ
defeated death on the cross, by His resurrection. And that
His death and resurrection has defeated Satan. I thank You
that it is no longer I that lives but Christ lives in me...Be with 
those who mourn the lose of loved ones...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...Stay on the course.
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
