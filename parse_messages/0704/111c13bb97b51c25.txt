HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Don't interfere with somethin'
that ain't brotherin' you none...

Our Meditation for Today:

God had planned something better for us so that only 
together with us would they be made perfect...(Heb. 11:40) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

There is a solidarity among believers, just look at Heb. 12:23.
Old and New Testament believers will be glorified together.

Not only are we one in the body of Christ with all those alive,
but we are also one with all those who ever lived...

It takes all of us to be perfect in Him...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, as we come to the end of the Lenten season
I thank you once again for the reminded of what Your Son
did on the cross for me. I thank you for that perfect sacrifice
He made for me. I also thank you for the resurrection and
what that means for all who believe in His finished work...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
