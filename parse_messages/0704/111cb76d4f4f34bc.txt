HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Live simply. Love generously. Care deeply.
Speak kindly. Leave the rest to God...

Our Meditation for Today:

Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter
of our faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the
cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right 
hand of the throne of God...(Heb. 12:2) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

The Christian life involves hard work. It requires us to give
up whatever endangers our relationship with God, to run
patiently, and to struggle against sin with the power of the
Holy Spirit...

To live effectively, we must keep our eyes on Jesus. We will
stumble if we look away from Him to stare at ourselves or at
the circumstances surrounding us...

We should be running for Christ, not ourselves, and we must 
always keep Him in sight...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that I would keep focused 
on You and not myself. I pray that the miracle of Easter
would be on the minds of my e-mail friends. I pray that 
each us would lay claim to the promise that is ours through
the finished work of Jesus on the cross...Amen.

Keep looking up, with your eyes on the Son...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
