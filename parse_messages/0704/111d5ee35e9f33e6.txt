HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~If you find yourself in a hole, 
the first thing to do is to stop diggen'.

Our Meditation for Today:

Consider Him who endured such oppression from sinful men, 
so that you will not grow weary and lose heart...(Heb. 12:3) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

When we face hardship and discouragement, it is easy to lose
sight of the big picture. But we are not alone; there is help...

Many have already made it through life, enduring far more difficult
circumstances than we have experienced. Suffering is the training 
ground for Christian maturity. It develops our patience and makes
our final victory sweet...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear heavenly Father, I used to think that I would never
thank You for the trials in my life, but I have grown to see
that without them I would never realize the blessings. So 
thank You Lord for because of those trials my faith in You 
has grown...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
