HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Timing has a lot to do with the outcome of a rain dance...

Our Meditation for Today:

Therefore since we are surrounded by such a great
cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that
hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let
us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.
(Heb. 12:1) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

This "huge cloud of witnesses" is composed of the people
described in chapter 11. Their faithfulness is a constant 
encouragement to us...

We do not struggle alone, and we are not the first to struggle
with the problems we face. Others have run the race and won.
and their witness stirs us to run and win also...

What an inspiring heritage we have...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, what a crowd of examples we have. Help
me to always remember that I am not dealing with some-
thing new but that others have had to deal with the same
struggles. I thank You that one day by Your plan I will be 
rewarded...Once again I pray for good health for my e-mail
friends, and healing for those who have under-went surgery.
be with those who are grieving the lose of a loved one...Amen.

Keep looking up with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
