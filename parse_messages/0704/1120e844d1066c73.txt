HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~When you get to your wit's end, you'll find that God lives there...

Our Meditation for Today:

Remember those in prison as if you were their fellow
prisoners, and those who are mistreated as if you
yourselves were suffering...(Heb. 13:3) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

We are to have empathy for those in prison, especially
for (but not limited to) Christians imprisoned for their
faith...

Jesus said that His true followers would represent Him 
as they visited those in prison (Mt. 25:36).

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, help me to always be mindful of
the misfortunes of others. Help me never to shun my
responsibility of sharing the Good News to all people.

Lay Your hand of healing on those who are sick.
Comfort those who are mourning the loss of a loved one...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
