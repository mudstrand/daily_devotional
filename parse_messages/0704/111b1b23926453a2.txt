HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(Food for thought)~~~Don't judge folks by their relatives...

Our Meditation for Today:

By faith the people passed through the red sea as on
dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they
were drowned.

By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the people had 
marched around them for seven days.

By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed
the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient.
(Heb. 11:29-31) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

When Joshua planned the conquest of Jericho, he sent spies
to investigate the fortifications of the city. The spies met Rahab,
who had two strikes against her, she was a Gentile and a prostitute.

But she showed that she had faith in God by welcoming the spies
and by trusting God to spare her and her family when the city was 
destroyed.

Faith helps us turn around and do what is right regardless of our past
or the disapproval of others...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, we see so many pillars of faith in Your
Word that struggled with many difficulties, yet they continued to 
trust in You. Help me Lord to grow in my faith toward You. Guide
me in paths of righteousness for Your name sake...Amen.

Keep looking up with an attitude of gratitude...Stay the course.
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
