HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Live a good, honorable life. then when you get older
and think back, you'll enjoy it a second time...

Our Meditation for Today:

Women received back their dead, raised to life again.
Others were tortured and refused to be released, so
that they might gain a better resurrection...

Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were
chained and put in prison...

They were stoned; they were sawed in two; they were
put to death by the sword. They went about in sheep-
skins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated,

The world was not worthy of them. They wandered in
deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the
ground.

These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them
received what had been promised...(Heb. 11:35-39) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

These verses summarize the lives of great men and women of
faith. Some experienced outstanding victories, even over the
threat of death...

But there were those who were severely mistreated, tortured and
even killed...

Having a steadfast faith in God does not guarantee a happy,
carefree life. On the contrary, our faith almost guarantees us 
some form of abuse from the world...

While we are on the earth, we may never see the purpose of 
our suffering. But we know that God will keep His promise to us.
Do you believe that God will keep His promise to you?

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You that I have never had to endure
the abuse that many believers have, but I pray that if the day ever
comes when I do, I pray that I would remain faithful to the end.
I thank You for the wonderful promise to all who remain faithful to
the end...Bless all my e-mail friends this day...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
