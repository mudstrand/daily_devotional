Subject: The Duck & the Devil (I'm in the 93rd percent)



The Duck & the Devil

There was a little boy visiting his grandparents on their farm. He was
given a slingshot to play with out in the woods.

He practiced in the woods; but he could never hit the target.

Getting a little discouraged, he headed back for dinner.

As he was walking back he saw Grandma's pet duck.
Just out of impulse, he let the slingshot fly, hit the duck square in the 
head and killed it.

He was shocked and grieved! In a panic, he hid the dead duck in the wood 
pile;
only to see his sister watching!

Sally had seen it all, but she said nothing.
After lunch the next day Grandma said, "Sally, let's wash the dishes."
But Sally said, "Grandma, Johnny told me he wanted to help in the kitchen."

Then she whispered to him, "Remember the duck?" So Johnny did the dishes.

Later that day, Grandpa asked if the children wanted to go fishing and 
Grandma said,
"I'm sorry but I need Sally to help make supper."
Sally just smiled and said, "Well that's all right because Johnny told me 
he wanted to help."
She whispered again, "Remember the duck?" So Sally went fishing and Johnny 
stayed to help.

After several days of Johnny doing both his chores and Sally's; he finally 
couldn't stand it any longer.
He came to Grandma and confessed that he had killed the duck.
Grandma knelt down, gave him a hug and said, "Sweetheart, I know.
You see, I was standing at the window and I saw the whole thing, but because 
I love you,
I forgave you. I was just wondering how long you would let Sally make a 
slave of you."

Thought for the day and every day thereafter.

Whatever is in your past, whatever you have done...
and the devil keeps throwing it up in your face
(lying, cheating, debt, fear, bad habits, hatred, anger, bitterness, 
etc.)...

hatever it is...You need to know that God was standing at the
window and He saw the whole thing.

He has seen your whole life. He wants you to know that He loves you and that 
you are forgiven.
He's just wondering how long you will let the devil make a slave of you.

The great thing about God is that when you ask for forgiveness; He not only
forgives you, but He forgets.

It is by God's grace and mercy that we are saved.


Go ahead and make the difference in someone's life today.
Share this with a friend and always remember:
God is at the window!

When Jesus died on the cross; he was thinking of you!

If you are one of the 93 % who will stand up for him forward this w/ the 
title, "I'm in the 93%"

Would you believe 7% of people won't forward this?
