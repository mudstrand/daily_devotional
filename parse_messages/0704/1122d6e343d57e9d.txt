HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~God Himself does not propose to judge a man 
until he is dead. So why should you?

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today
and forever...(Heb. 13:8) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Though human leaders have much to offer, we must keep
our eyes on Christ, our ultimate leader...

Unlike any human leaders, He will never change. Christ is 
the same forever...

In an unchanging world we can trust our unchanging Lord...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, It is so comforting to know that
Your Word is the same yesterday and today, and for-
ever-more. I thank You also for Your loving kindness,
and Your forgiving heart...

Bless my e-mail friends with good health and safety...Amen.


Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
