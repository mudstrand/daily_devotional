Real Eye Opener



WHY is the USA BANKRUPT?





Informative, as well as mind boggling! 





You think the war in Iraq was costing us too much? 

Read this:



We have been hammered with the propaganda that it

was the Iraq war and the war on terror that is bankrupting us.



I now find that to be RIDICULOUS.



I hope the following 14 reasons are forwarded over

and over again until they are read so many times

that the reader gets sick of reading them. 



I also have included the URL's for verification

of all the following facts...



1.

$11 Billion to $22 billion is spent on welfare to illegal aliens each year by state

governments.

assistance programs such as food stamps, WIC,

American wages are caused by the illegal

aliens.

10. 

The illegal aliens in the United States have

a crime rate that's two and a half times that of

white non-illegal aliens. In particular,

their children are going to make a huge

additional crime problem in the US .

The total cost is a whopping $ 338.3 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND IF YOU'RE LIKE ME, HAVING TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY; IT IS $338,300,000,00000 WHICH WOULD BE ENOUGH TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY FOR THE CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY 



Are we THAT stupid?



YES, FOR LETTING THOSE IN THE U.S. CONGRESS GET AWAY

WITH LETTING THIS HAPPEN YEAR AFTER YEAR!!!!!



IT WOULD REALLY MEAN SOMETHING IF YOU EAMILED YOUR CONGRESSPERSON AND SENATOR, 

AND ASKED FOR A RESPONSE ! ! ! ! 

If this doesn't bother you then just delete the

message. If, on the other hand, it does

raise the hair on the back of your neck,

I hope you forward it to every legal resident.

This is why they did the right thing in Arizona .

More states should follow their lead.



It's easy to dismiss individual programs that benefit non-citizens until they're put together and this

picture emerges.



Someone did a lot of research to put together all of this data.



Often these programs are buried within other programs making them difficult to find.



Truly one of the better messages being floated around, all has verification
