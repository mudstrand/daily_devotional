SERENITY

Just before the funeral services, the 
undertaker came up to the very elderly widow and asked,
'How old was your 
husband?' '98,' she replied...
'Two years older than me'
'So you're 96,' 
the undertaker commented..
She responded, 'Hardly worth going home, is 
it?


Reporters interviewing a 104-year-old woman:
'And what do you 
think is the best thing
about being 104?' the reporter asked..
She simply 
replied, 'No peer pressure.'


The nice thing about being senile 
is
you can hide your own Easter eggs
and have fun finding 
them.


I've sure gotten old!
I've had two bypass surgeries, a hip 
replacement,
new knees, fought prostate cancer and diabetes.
I'm half 
blind,
can't hear anything quieter than a jet engine,
take 40 different 
medications that
make me dizzy, winded, and subject to blackouts.
Have 
bouts with dementia.
Have poor circulation;
hardly feel my hands and feet 
anymore.
Can't remember if I'm 85 or 92.
Have lost all my friends. 
But, thank God,
I still have my driver's license.


I feel like my 
body has gotten totally out of shape,
so I got my doctor's permission 
to
join a fitness club and start exercising.
I decided to take an aerobics 
class for seniors.
I bent, twisted, gyrated, jumped up and down, and 
perspired for an hour. But,
by the time I got my leotards on,
the class 
was over.


An elderly woman decided to prepare her will and
told 
her preacher she had two final requests.
First, she wanted to be cremated, 
and second,
she wanted her ashes scattered over Wal-Mart.
' 
Wal-Mart ?' the preacher exclaimed.
'Why Wal-Mart?'
'Then I'll be sure my 
daughters visit me twice a week'


My memory's not as sharp as it used 
to be.
Also, my memory's not as sharp as it used to be.


Know how 
to prevent sagging?
Just eat till the wrinkles fill out.


It's 
scary when you start making the same noises
as your coffee 
maker.


These days about half the stuff
in my shopping cart 
says,
'For fast relief.'


THE SENILITY PRAYER :
Grant me the 
senility to forget the people
I never liked anyway,
the good fortune to 
run into the ones I do, and
the eyesight to tell the 
difference.


Now, I think you're supposed to share this with 5 or 6, 
maybe 10 others. Oh heck, give it to a bunch of your friends if you can remember 
who they are!

Always Remember This:
You don't stop laughing 
because you grow old,
You grow old because you stop 
laughing
