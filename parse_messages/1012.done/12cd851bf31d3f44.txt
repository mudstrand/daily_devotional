Subject: RE: Strong Person









Strong Person 

A strong person knows how to keep their life in order. Even with tears in their eyes, they still manage to say "I'm ok" with a smile. Send this to a strong person. I just did. God is good. Change is coming. God saw your sadness and said hard times are over. If you believe in Him, send this to ten people including me. Watch what happens in thirty minutes! Be honest and send this to anyone who made you smile this year. 
:) It may surprise you how many you get back. 
Thanks for making me smile. 

Live, Laugh, Love 
"Life isn't about how you survive the storm, but how you dance in the rain" 


Life is short! Forgive quickly!
Love truly, Laugh uncontrollably and Let your Light shine brightly for all the world to see!!!!.
