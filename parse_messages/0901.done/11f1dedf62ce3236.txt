Thur. 29/09~~~food for thought~~~Be merciful just as your Father (in heaven) 
is merciful...(Lk. 6:36)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be shown mercy...(Mt. 5:7)

The wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure;
then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of
mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere...(Jm. 3:17)

Our Lesson for Today:

Nothing expresses God's yearning to forgive better than the
Book of Jonah. It contains only one line of prophecy: "Forty
more days and Nineveh will be overturned." (3:4)

BUT, to Jonah's disgust, that simple announcement of doom
sparked a spiritual revival in Nineveh and changed God's plans 
for punishment...

Jonah, sulking under a shriveled vine, admitted he had suspected 
God's soft heart all along. I believe this is the reason for the ocean
storm, and how the whale detour came about. Yes I believe because
Jonah could not trust God, could not, that is, trust Him to be harsh 
and unrelenting toward Nineveh...

As Robert Frost summed up the story, "After Jonah, you could 
never trust God not to be merciful again."

Prayer Suggestion:
Let it be a prayer of praise like that of, Micah 7:18
Who is a God like You, who pardons sin and forgives the
transgression of the remnant of his transgression? You
do not stay angry forever but delight in showing mercy...

(Wow)
