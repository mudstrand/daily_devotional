1/12/09~~~(food for thought)~~~Our flesh and our heart may fail, but God is our strength...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

God is our refuge and strength, an ever present help in trouble. 
Therefore I will not fear, though the earth give way and the
mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar
and foam and the mountains quake with their surging...(Ps. 46:1-3)

Our Lesson for Today:

Life is always composed of those experiences and encounters which
provide both challenges to ones character and the testing of one's
spirit...

In 1 Kgs. 19, I see a defeated and desolate Elijah sitting under a broom
tree in the solitude of his own sadness. He had to ask life's most difficult
question: "How did I get to where I am which is so far from where I am
supposed to be?"

If you haven't figured this out yet, let me tell you, there are only three kinds
of people in the world: those who are in the wilderness, those who have 
just come in from the wilderness, and those who are headed into the wilderness...

In the midst of Elijah's wilderness experience, God sent His angel to feed him.
"You don't have enough for your journey."

"What journey" I'm through. I'm all washed up."

"You're not through yet, Elijah. I'm going to send you from where you 
are to where I want you to be. I'm going to send you from the wilderness
to the mountain."

In the wilderness there is weakness, but on the mountain there is strength.
In the wilderness there is loneliness, but on the mountain there is 
companionship. In the wilderness there is despair, but on the mountain 
there is hope...

God has said, "I will never leave you or forsake you." So It is only because 
we do not recognize God's presence that we find ourselves in the 
wilderness. He wants to fellowship with us on the mountain...

Prayer suggestion:
Pray that you become more sensitive to God's presence
so that you can have a mountain top experience with Him...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
