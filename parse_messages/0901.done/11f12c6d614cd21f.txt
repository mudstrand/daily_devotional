Mon. 26/09~~~food for thought~~~Be joyful in hope, faithful in prayer...(Ro. 12:2)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of
what we do not see...(Heb. 11:1)

Be strong and take heart, all you who hope in the Lord...(Ps. 31:24)

Our Lesson for Today:

Most generally acts of hope expose themselves to ridicule because
they seem impractical, failing to conform to visible reality...

BUT in fact they are reality that is being constructed but is not yet visible...

Hope is what commits us to actions that connect us with God...

Often what we call hoping is often only wishing. We want things we
think are impossible, but we have better sense than to spend money
or commit our lives to them...

Biblical hope, though, is an act. Hope acts on conviction that God will 
complete the work that He has begun even when the appearances,
especially when the appearances, oppose it...

Hope-determined actions participate in the future that God is bringing
into being. However these acts are rarely spectacular. Usually they
take place outside sacred settings. Hardly ever are they viewed
to be significant by outsiders...

It is not easy to act in hope because most of the immediate evidence
is against it. Yes it takes courage to act in hope. But it is the only
practical action that survives the decay of the moment...

Our Prayer Suggestion:
Pray that your heart is set aside for Christ as Lord...
Pray that you would always be ready to give an
answer to everyone who asks you to give a reason
for the hope that you have...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather...
