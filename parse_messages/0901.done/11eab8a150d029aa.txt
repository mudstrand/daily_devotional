Our Verses for Today:

I do everything through Him who gives me strength...
(Phil. 4:13)

If you remain in Me and My Words remain in you,
ask whatever you wish, and it will be given to you...
(Jn. 15:7)

Praise be to the Lord, to God or Savior, who daily
bears our burdens...
(Ps. 68:18)

Our Lesson for Today:

Some dear friends stopped by a couple of nights ago and we
discussed different times in our lives when it was very evident
that God had been in control of our life either saving us from near
death, or someone whom we came into contact with...

Because of this wonderful visit I was reminded of Lamentations 3:22-26
which has a very wonderful lesson for us...

Because of the Lord's great love we are not consumed, for His
compassion's never fail.

They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.

I say to myself, "The Lord is my portion; therefore I will wait for Him."

The Lord is good to those whose hope is in Him, to the one
who seeks Him;

It is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord...

I am reminded that the material things of this life, were never
intended to posses my heart, that everything good is in another 
world and my only true treasure is Christ...

Perhaps, by God's grace, I succeed, and for a day or two
become a creature consciously dependent on God and
drawing my strength from the right sources...

But it seems that the moment a threat is withdrawn, my fleshly
nature leaps back to my earthly treasures...

It is then that the terrible necessity of tribulation is only to
clear...my only real treasure must be Christ...

Our Prayer Should Be:
Lord help me to focus on my true treasure, Your Son,
my Savior, Jesus Christ...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
