1/13/09~~~food for thought)~~~Everyone who hears God's Word, 
needs to put them into practice...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light,
so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done
has been done through God...Jn. 3:21

By this all men will know that you are my disciples,
if you love one another...Jn. 13:35

Our Lesson for Today:

The crossroads that we often face in our lives, IF we
examine that closely are really spiritual crossroads.

We have to decide whether or not we believe what the Bible says.
All our decisions hang on that decision. It is important that our
faith outweighs all our doubts...

That decision will make an immediate difference in your life.
It will surely transform you into a better person, even while you
are yet learning...

What that decision will do is readjust your priorities and give you
a sense of confidence and peace about the future...

Prayer suggestion:
Pray that God will help you put Him first in your life
and help you to readjust your priorities...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
