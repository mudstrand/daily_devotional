Tue/20/09~~~food for thought~~~The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want...(Ps. 23:1)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Whoever trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous
will thrive like a green leaf...(Pro. 11:28)

And my God will meet all your needs according to His
riches in Christ Jesus...(Phil. 4:19)

Our Lesson for Today:

Never settle for second-rate or selfish goals. set goals for
yourself that involve helping other people and the riches will
follow...

The richest people I know are those who have given themselves
unselfishly to other people. Such motivation will affect the way 
you sell, cook, teach or apply your particular trade...

True riches, of course are totally unrelated to money or material
reward. In fact, if a person has earned money without helping people,
his money will not buy him happiness...

Of one thing I am sure: happy people have strong goals, and
somehow these include helping other people. They can also
be assured that they will never run out of people to help...

Prayer Suggestion:
Lets pray that we do not turn our backs on people
less fortunate than we. Let us give thanks for those
who helped us when we were in need, most of all
thank God for these people and ask that He would 
bless them...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
