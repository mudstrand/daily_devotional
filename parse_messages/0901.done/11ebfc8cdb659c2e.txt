1/10/09~~~(food for thought)~~~I can do everything through Christ who gives
me strength...(Phil. 4:13)

Our Verses for Today:

Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering,
as though something strange is happening to you...

But rejoice that you participate in the suffering of Christ, so that you 
may be overjoyed when His glory is revealed...(I Pet. 4:12, 13)

Our Lesson for Today:

It takes courage to look your spouse in the eye and say, "Our marriage
is in serious trouble, and we have to do something about it."

What do most people do? Well it is sad to say but most put their 
problems on the back burner and go their own directions.

It also takes relational courage to build significant relationships with 
friends, to look another person in the eye and say, "Isn't it time we
stopped talking about the weather and the stock market and start
talking about what's going on in your life and mine? Isn't it time we
became brothers?"

Not many men have the courage to challenge each other, to fight for
each other's spiritual and relational growth. But I have learned over the 
years that I will not be a success in my marriage, with my kids or with
my friends, without courage...

Prayer Suggestions:
Pray for the courage to share your feelings with family
friends, and other acquaintances in humility. Be honest 
with God and He will give you courage and strength...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
