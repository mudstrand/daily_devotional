1/15/09~~~food for thought~~~Our union with Christ is of the utmost importance...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life,
and this life is in His Son...(I Jn. 5:11)

For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only
Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but 
have eternal life...(Jn. 3:16)

Our Lesson for Today:

Let us give thanks for the assurance of eternal life! Because 
of our sinful flesh we could never deserve such an assurance,
now knowing this we should be doubly grateful that He has given
us the right to eternal life through union with His Son or Savior...

Let us also give thanks that while we live in the world we can seek 
to serve Him fruitfully, and to praise Him by the kind of life we live,
as well as by our lips...

Let us pray that the indwelling of His Spirit will ever keep before us
the great privilege of being an heir of His glory, and a citizen of
heaven...

May our lives praise and worship Him in closest possible fellowship.
Let us continue to worship and adore Him through Jesus Christ His
Son...

Let This Be Our Constant Prayer...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
