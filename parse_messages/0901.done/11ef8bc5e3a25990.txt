Wed. 21/09~~~food for thought~~~Be kind and compassionate to one another
forgiving each other, just as in Christ God
forgave you...(Eph. 4:32)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven,
whose sins are covered...(Ro. 4:7)

"I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their
sins no more," says the Lord...(Heb. 8:12)

Help us, O God our Savior, for the glory of Your name;
deliver us and forgive our sins for Your name's sake...
(Ps. 79:9)

Our Lesson for Today:

It has been said: "Forgiving is love's revolution against 
love's unfairness."

Before you read any farther, reread the quote above...

So basically what this is saying is: When we forgive, we
ignore the normal laws that strap us to the natural laws of 
getting even. So I guess you could say is, by some magic 
of love, we release ourselves from our own painful past... 

So it has also been said that, "by being forgiving we fly over
a dues-paying morality in order to create a new future out 
of the past's unfairness...

So actually if this is true we free ourselves from the wrongs
that were locked into our private histories...

We unshackle our spirits from wrongful acts; and, maybe, if
we are lucky, we also restore a relationship that would otherwise
be lost forever...

Yes there is a sort of "magic" in loving forgiveness...

Prayer Suggestion:
Let us pray that God would restore or give us a loving,
forgiving heart, so that all our relationships may be restored,
thus also restoring a new relationship with Him...
