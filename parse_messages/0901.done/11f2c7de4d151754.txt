Sat. 31/09~~~food for thought~~~Be strong in the Lord and His mighty power...(Eph 6:10)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

To God belong wisdom and power; counsel and 
understanding are His...(Job 12:13)

God's wisdom is profound, and His power is vast.
Who has resisted Him and come out unscathed? (Job 9:4)

Our lesson for Today:

What makes the temptation of power so seemingly
irresistible?

is it that, power offers an easy substitute for the hard
task of love?

It seems easier to be God than to love God, easier 
to control people than to love people, easier to own
life that to love life...

The long painful history of the church is the history of 
the people ever and again tempted to choose power 
over love, control over the cross, being a leader over
being led...

Those who have resisted this temptation are truly saints,
and in the end give us hope...

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray for the character of humility, love and grace...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
