Broken Fall

Broken Fall

A number of years ago, a lighthouse was being built on the rock-bound coast of Wales. When the building was nearly completed, one of the workmen stumbled and fell back through the scaffolding to the rocks below.

The other workmen, shocked at what had taken place, did not dare to look down for fear of being unnerved at the sight. Heavyhearted, they backed down the ladders. But to their surprise and joy they saw their fellow workman lying upon a tuft of grass, shaken and shocked, bruised to be sure, but not seriously harmed. Beside him lay a dead lamb. A flock of sheep had been wandering by, and a lamb had broken his fall.

What a vivid reminder that The True Lamb has broken our fall and has defeated death for every one of us!

"The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world." (John 1:29)
