You were chosen to receive this novena.

The moment you receive it, say :

Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven, Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen..

GOD WANTED ME TO TELL YO U, It shall be well with you this coming year.

No matter how much your enemies try this year, they will not succeed.

You have been destined to make it and you shall surely achieve all your goals this year.

For all of 2009, all your agonies will be diverted and victory and prosperity will be incoming in abundance. Today God has confirmed the end of your suffering's, sorrows and pain because HE that sits on the throne has remembered you. He has taken away the hardships and given you JOY. He will never let you down.

I knocked at heaven's door this morning, God asked me .. My child! What can I do for you? And I said, 'Father, please protect and bless the person reading this message... '

This is a Novena from Mother Theresa that started in 1952.

It has never been broken. Within 48 hours send 20 copies (or as many as you can - God does know if you don't have 20 people to send it to. It's the effort and intent that counts) to family and friends.

This is a powerful Novena. Couldn't hurt. Can only help.


Please do not break it..
