07/05/2010~~~food for thought~~~ALWAYS REJOICING?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Restore to me the joy of Your Salvation...(Ps. 51:12)

Our Lesson for Today:
Only one kind of person can live happily all the time. That's the believer in Christ.
No, a Christian's life is not always filled with sunshine. He or she doesn't always 
walk on a super smooth highway. ~ In fact, often believers have more problems
than unbelievers. ~ In His wisdom, God knows that all sunshine and no rain is
not conductive for growing the flower of faith...

So how can believers rejoice all the time? How can they smile in the midst
of tears and be happy even when they hurt? ~ Doesn't the psalmist remind us?
He points us to God's salvation...

When I have complete relief from life's greatest hurting the form of forgiveness 
for my sins, I have joy that no outward circumstances can strip from me. When
I have the Savior, as the pearl of great price, I am ecstatically rich even if my
earthly treasures slip away...

When I have heaven as my destination, I can keep on smiling even though the
potholes of life jar my very existence...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, restore to me the joy of Your salvation
so that each day I rejoice in Jesus...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
