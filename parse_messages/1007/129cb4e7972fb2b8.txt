Good read........ 
On the way to Canton , driving on Michigan Avenue , on Thursday 
morning, I saw an infant car seat on the side of the road with a 
blanket draped over it. I did not stop, even though I had all kinds of 
thoughts running through my head. But when I got to my destination, I 
called the Canton PD and they were going to check it out. This is what 
I was told... 
"Several things to be aware of .. gangs and thieves, are now plotting 
different ways to get a person to "stop" their vehicle. 
"There is a gang initiation reported by the local police department 
that gangs are placing a car seat by the road...with a fake baby in 
it...waiting for a woman, of course, to stop and check on the baby. 
Note that the location of this car seat will usually be beside a 
wooded or grassy (field) area ...and the person - woman - will be 
dragged into the woods- beaten and raped- usually left for dead. 
DO NOT STOP . DIAL 9-1-1 AND REPORT WHAT YOU SAW. 
"IF YOU ARE DRIVING AT NIGHT AND EGGS ARE THROWN 
AT YOUR WINDSHIELD. DO NOT OPERATE THE WIPER 
AND DO NOT SPRAY ANY WATER BECAUSE EGGS MIXED 
WITH WATER BECOME MILKY AND BLOCK YOUR VISION 
UP TO 92.5% YOU ARE THEN FORCED TO STOP BESIDE 
THE ROAD AND BECOME A VICTIM OF THIEVES. THIS IS 
A NEW TECHNIQUE USED BY GANGS. PLEASE INFORM 
YOUR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES. THESE ARE DESPERATE 
TIMES AND THESE UNSAVORY INDIVIDUALS WILL TAKE 
DESPERATE MEASURES TO GET WHAT THEY WANT." 
Please talk to your loved ones about this. 
This is a new tactic used - we don't want anyone to 
fall victim to this kind of crime. Please be safe
