07/12/2010~~~food for thought~~~NOT ONE CENT

Our Bible Verse for Today:
You who have no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine
and milk without money and without cost...(Isa. 55:1)

Our Lesson for Today:
We are all aware of the fact that food costs are going up today.
Yes food costs money, and only lasts for a short time, and it only
meets our physical needs...

But God offers us free nourishment that feeds our soul. How are we to get it?
We are to come (55:1), listen (55:2), seek and call on God (55:6)...

YES, God salvation is freely offered, but to nourish our souls we must
eagerly receive it. we will starve spiritually without this food as surely
as we will starve physically without our daily bread...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, feed me with the free forgiveness bought
by Jesus' blood and offered in Your Word...Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
