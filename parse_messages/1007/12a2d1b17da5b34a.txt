08/01/2010~~~food for thought~~~LEARNING ABOUT HIS WAYS

Our Bible Verse for Today:
When Jesus finished commanding His twelve disciples...
He departed from there to teach and preach in their cities..(Mt. 11:1)

Our Lesson for Today:
We need to watch so we do not began to debate with God and put what we
call our duty into competition with His commands. if we say, "I know that He
told me to go, but my duty is here," it simply means that we do not believe 
that Jesus means what He says...

Let us be careful not to play God's role in the lives of others, and become 
so noisy in our instruction of other people that God cannot get near them.
There are times we need to keep our mouths shut and our spirits alert...

God wants to instruct us regarding His Son, and He wants to turn our times 
of prayer into mounts of transfiguration. Are we detached enough from our
own spiritual fits of emotion to wait patiently for Him? Waiting is not sitting
with folded hands doing nothing, but learning to do what we are told...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, Help me to be patient, yet sensitive to Your every
command...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
