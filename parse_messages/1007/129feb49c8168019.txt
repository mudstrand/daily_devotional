07/23/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE SAVIOR'S TREASURE HUNT

Our Bible Verse for Today:
And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says,
"Rejoice with me, I have found my lost coin." (Lk. 15:9)

Our Lesson for Today:
We have here a wonderful picture of how diligently Jesus searches for lost souls.
His great love moves Him on the greatest treasure hunt this world has ever seen. ~ 
This hunt reached its height on Calvary's wondrous cross...

Yes so precious did Jesus consider each sinner that He was willing to pay
the maximum price for each one -- His own blood! Now His love sends Him 
out every day to search for lost sinners through His Word...

How can I ever thank Jesus for the diligent love with which He ~ found me!!!
When I sought Him not...

Prayer Suggestion:
Thank You Lord Jesus, and please keep me safe in Your hand...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6

Please forgive me but I will be gone for a few days to Fargo to help
my daughter move to her new place...God bless, don't forget to visit
the Lord's house this week end...
