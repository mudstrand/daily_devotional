07/07/2010~~~food for thought~~~SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Sing to the Lord a new song, for He has done marvelous things; His
right hand and His holy arm have worked salvation for Him...(Ps. 98:1)

Our Lesson for Today:
Oh how often we forget that we are to have a child-like faith ~ a child-like
heart. Sometimes I even forget what Jesus has done for me...

And so I rub away at my sins as if I had to eliminate their spots. I worriedly 
peer ahead at heaven's door as if I had to pry it open with my own deeds.
Instead of singing, I mope around...

YES sometimes I need a reminder of the marvelous things my gracious God
has already done for me ~ how His right hand and holy arm have worked
salvation for me in His Son, Jesus...

YES, a new song ~ that's what we need and that's what will come when we knee; 
beneath the cross of our Savior...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, teach me to sing with joy because
of Your salvation...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
