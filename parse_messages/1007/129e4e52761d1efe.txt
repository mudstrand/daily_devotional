07/18/2010~~~food for thought~~~WHAT TO DO WITH SIN

Our Bible Verse for Today:
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins
and purify us from all unrighteousness... (I Jn. 1:9)

Our Lesson for Today:
That's the number one question, isn't it? ~~~ What to do with my sin?

If God has forgiven us for our sins because of Christ's death, 
why must we confess our sins? ~~~

In admitting our sins and receiving Christ's cleansing, we are 
(1) agreeing with God that our sin is truly sin and that we are willing to turn from it,
(2) ensuring that we don't conceal our sins from Him and consequently from ourselves, and
(3) recognizing our tendency to sin and relying on His power to overcome it...

But we need to remember that true confession involves a commitment not to continue
in sin. We wouldn't be genuinely confessing our sins to God IF we planned to commit 
them again and just wanted temporary forgiveness. ~ We should also pray for strength
to defeat temptation the next time we face it...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, thank You for showing me Jesus as the answer for my sins.
Give me the strength to defeat temptation...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
