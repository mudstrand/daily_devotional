07/04/2010~~~food for thought~~~FREEDOM IS NOT FREE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
If the Son sets you free you will be free indeed...(Jn. 8:36)

Our Lesson for Today:
Thousands gave their lives in four major conflicts in the 20th century alone
so that Miss Liberty might stand tall in New York's harbor, and so we can breath 
free...

"The Cross of Calvary" it's called, those timbers set up on that skull-shaped
hill. the wood's long ago, but not the liberty secured there. On that cross God's
Son secured a freedom far more precious than any other in the world. That
cross speaks of freedom from sin's curse and Satan's slavery...

No more frantic scrambling to secure salvation with our own futile works. No more
chilling fear of deaths cold chamber. The Son has set us free...

This freedom also had a price. ~ Nearly 2,000 years ago, the God-man hung on 
that cross enduring the worst that both earth and hell could dispense. But He 
secured liberty in full with His complete payment for all sinners of all time. Now
He offers that precious liberty to me with out price. It's mine free of cost. I'm
free to live for God and with God, on earth and in eternity.

Prayer Suggestion:
Blessed Savior, help me appreciate the precious 
liberty You've earned for Me...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
