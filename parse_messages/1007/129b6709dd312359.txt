07/09/2010~~~food for thought~~~HIS BRAND'S ON ME

Our Bible Verse for Today:
I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name;
you are mine...(Isa. 43:1)

Our Lesson for Today:
The Lord has a distinctive brand on those who belong to him, just as the ranchers had 
on their cattle years ago. When God says, "I have redeemed you," He's pointing to the 
cross of Jesus. I was a maverick who didn't belong to God. With sins' strands, Satan 
had me tied hand and foot. When the time for the eternal roundup came, the devil would 
want to lock me forever inside his corral of hell...

But God in all His mercy stepped in. He sent His son to buy sinners back from Satan.
Not with so many dollars per head, but with the precious blood of His only Son. This
price was sufficient for all sinners of all times...

"You are mine," The God of all grace says. That's why I can say with joy, 
"His brand is on me!"

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, thank You for making me your own through faith
in Jesus. Keep Your brand on me...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
