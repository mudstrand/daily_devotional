07/15/2010~~~food for thought~~~GOD'S OWN DYNAMITE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
For I am not ashamed of this Good News about Christ. It is the 
power of God at work, saving everyone who believes ~ Jew
first and also Gentiles... (Ro. 1:16)

Our Lesson for Today:
Not only does the gospel tell me the good news, it is also God's power to
bring me to faith. The gospel is both God's message and God's means...

Our gracious God use it like some stick of dynamite to blast open my
stony heart of unbelief, to convert that heart into a home for my Savior,
and keep my heart in faith in His Son as my only Savior...

The Gospel is far more powerful then dynamite. The Lord gave me a sinner,
something far more powerful in His gospel...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me treasure and use the power of Your
gospel as Your message and means...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to The father except through me." - John: 14:6
