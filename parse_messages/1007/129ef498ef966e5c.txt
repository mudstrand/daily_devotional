07/20/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE FATHER'S WAITING

Our Bible Verse for Today:
(The parable of the lost son) While he was still a long way off, his father saw 
him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms
around him and kissed him. (Lk. 15:20)

Our Lesson for Today:
The parable of the prodigal son is really a story about the waiting father. I know who
the prodigal son is. It is me who so foolishly and so often have left the Father's house.

What I really need to know is about the heavenly Father. Does He write me out of His
will or long for my return? Will He slam the door of heaven in my face or open His arms 
to me? Will He treat me as some slave or take me back as a son or daughter?

Here's the answer!!! Because of another Son, named Jesus, who left His Father's 
house on the task of salvation and returned with it completed, my Father will be waiting 
for me...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Father, thank you for still waiting for me
although I often wander far from home...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
