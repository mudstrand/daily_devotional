07/ 11/2010~~~food for thought~~~JESUS' GIFT OF HEALTH

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Praise the Lord, . . . who forgives all your sins and heals all your
diseases...(Ps. 103:3)

Our Lesson for Today:
There is no greater spiritual illness than sin. But many do not know they have it.
The Pharisee thanked God that he wasn't like other people ~ robbers, evildoers, 
adulterers (Lk. 18:11). But he was mortally sick with sinful pride and didn't even 
recognize the symptoms...

The rich young ruler thought he was good enough to merit heaven but couldn't
think of parting with his possessions (Lk. 18:18). You could say he had influenza
brought on by the sin of loving goods more than God...

And my disease? Do I know how sick I am? How terminally ill with the sickness
of sin? Unless I do, I'll feel little need for the healing a gracious God provides in
Jesus...

Our caring Physician, our gracious Lord, wrote out and filled the prescription for
healing at no cost to us. He sent His Son for sinners like me. He is the medicine
my dying soul must have...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, remind me every day of my sins so that I reach
for the healing of Your forgiveness...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
