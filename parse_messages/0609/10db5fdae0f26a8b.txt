GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...Those who deserve love the least
need it the most...

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus says: "If you remain in Me and My words remain in you, ask whatever
you wish and it will be given to you. This is to My Father's glory, that you bear 
much fruit, showing yourselves to be My disciples...(Jn. 15:7, 8) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

I often hear the statement, "I've been asking and asking how come I don't get 
what I want?"

The key to answered prayer is in the beginning of vs. 7 "If you remain in Me and
My words remain in you."

What this is saying is, we need to keep our faith anchored in Christ and the cross, in doing so
what ever we ask will be in accordance with God's will for us...

When a vine produces "much fruit" God is glorified, for in the process each day He 
sends the sunshine and rain to make the crops grow, and constantly He nurtured 
each tiny plant and prepared it to blossom.

What a moment of glory for the Lord of the harvest when it is brought into the barns,
mature and ready for use! He made it all happen!!!

This farming analogy shows how God is glorified when people come into a right
relationship with Him and begin to "produce much fruit" in their lives...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You that you even choose to have 
a relationship with such as I...I pray for a greater maturity so that
I may produce much fruit...I pray again O Lord for Godly wisdom...Amen.

Keep looking up, for in Him we are made whole...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
