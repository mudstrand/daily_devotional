GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...A critical spirit is like poison ivy---it only takes
a little contact to spread its poison...

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus says: "You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you,
to go and bear fruit---fruit that will last. Then the Father will give you
whatever you ask in My name..." (Jn. 15:16) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Remember Jesus made the first choice---to love and to die for us,
and to invite us to live with Him forever...

It is up to us to make the second choice---to accept or reject the offer...

Without His choice, we would have no choice to make...

Remember there is no middle road...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I truly thank You for the sacrifice You made for me.
I thank You for the invitation You made to give eternal life to all who have
accepted You as Savior...I pray that there would be a real out-pouring of
Your Spirit upon the hearts of every believer, to bear fruit for You...Amen.

Keep looking up, there is an open door to all who accept Him...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
