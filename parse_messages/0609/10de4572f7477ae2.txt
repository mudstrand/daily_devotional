GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...If you have to tell people how good you are
you're probably not that good...

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus says: "If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin.
Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin...

He who hates Me hates My Father as well...If I had not done among them what no 
one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen these miracles,
and yet they have hated both Me and My Father.

But this is written in their Law; 'They hated Me without reason...(Jn. 15:22-25) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

The greatest sin we can commit is to reject Christ...When Jesus says "they have 
no excuse," He is referring to the work of the cross...When we think about His 
sacrifice for us, rejecting him is unforgivable...

Jesus' Teaching, Preaching, and Miracles all plainly reveal Who He was, but
yet much of the world rejects Him and also hates the Christian...

It is pretty plain to see by what is happening in the Moslem countries...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Lord, I'm so thankful that I have a loving God, I am so thankful that
You call all who love You, Your child...I pray that one day there will be no
more hatred in the world...I pray that all men will be able to live side by
side in love...Amen.

Keep looking up, you will not find a more loyal friend...
You're in the Prayers of Two who care...
