GOOD MORNING YOU ALL!!!...(food for thought)...Jesus is a friend who walks in when
the world has walked out...
Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus says: "I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in Me
and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from Me you can do nothing. If
anyone does not remain in Me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and
withers; such branches are picked up and thrown into the fire and burned...
(Jn. 15:5, 6) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

To often " fruit bearing" is mistaken for merely soul winning but there is much more
that is found in this term...

In this chapter prayer, joy, and love are mentioned as fruit. there are other fruits
mentioned in Gal. 5:22-24 and II Pet. 1:5-8)

"Remaining in Christ" means (1) believing that He is God's Son (I Jn. 4:15),
(2) receiving Him as Savior and Lord (Jn. 1:12, (3) doing what God says (I Jn 3:24)
(4) continuing to believe the Good News (I Jn. 2:24, and (5) relating in love to the 
community of believers, Christ's body (Jn. 15:12)...

Keep this list close at hand to see how you fare, and to see where you need 
improvement...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I know that I often fall short in the "fruit bearing"
part of my life and I ask your forgiveness for that...I also ask for an enlightening
so that I may become more efficient in this area...I pray that I would be more 
sensitive and obedient to Your Holy Spirits leading...I also pray for Your hand of 
protection for our troops, comfort and sustain their families I pray in Jesus name...Amen

Keep looking up, for a special blessing today...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
