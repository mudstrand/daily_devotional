GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...He who buries his talent is making
a grave mistake. (I Tim. 4:14a)

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus says, "When he, (the Spirit) comes, he will convict the world of guilt 
in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment: in regard to sin, because 
men do not believe in Me; in regard to righteousness, because I am going 
to the Father, where you can see Me no longer, and in regard to judgment, 
because the prince of this world now stands condemned. (Jn.16:8-11) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Jesus tell us that the Holy Spirit has three important tasks, 
(1) convicting the world of its sin and calling it to repentance, 

(2) revealing the standard of God's righteousness to anyone 
who believes, because Christ would no longer be physically 
present on earth, and 

(3) demonstrating Christ's judgment over Satan...

In vs. 9 according to Jesus, not believing in Him is sin...

Christ's death on the cross made a personal relationship with God available 
to us. When we confess our sin, God declares us righteous and delivers us 
from judgment for our sins...

This country once again needs to listen to the Holy Spirit and confess it's sins...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Lord I thank You for all that Jesus made available to me
through His death on the cross...I thank You also for the convicting 
power of the Holy Spirit...I pray that I would always be sensitive
and obedient to the Holy Spirit...Forgive me Lord for any unconfessed 
sin...Amen.

Keep looking up, the Lord wishes to have a personal relationship with you...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
