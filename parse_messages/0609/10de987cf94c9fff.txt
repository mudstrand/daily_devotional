GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...Language is the expression of thought.
Every time you speak, your mind is on parade...

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus says, "When the Counselor comes, whom I will send to you from
the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, He will testify
about Me. And you also must testify, for you have been with Me from
the beginning." (Jn 15:26, 27) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Once again Jesus offers hope...The Holy Spirit gives strength to endure the
unreasonable hatred and evil in our world and the hostility many have toward
Christ... This is especially comforting for those facing persecution...

Jesus uses two names for the Holy Spirit, "Counselor" and "Spirit of Truth."

The word Counselor conveys the helping, encouraging, and strengthening work
of the Spirit.

Spirit of Truth, points to the teaching, illuminating, and reminding work of the Spirit.

The Holy Spirit ministers to both the head and the heart, and both are every important...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for Your Spirit's presence, as teacher and comforter.
I pray that I would be sensitive and obedient to His encouraging presence...

I pray Lord for Your hand of protection for our troops today, bless and protect their families
as they take care of matters here at home...

I pray too for our countries leaders, both federal, state, and local. May they seek wisdom 
from You...Amen.

Keep looking up, He gives wisdom to all who ask...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
