GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...Laziness and poverty are cousins. (Pro. 24:33, 34)

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus says: "This is My command: love each other." (Jn. 15:17) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

As we are seeing today, Christians are getting plenty of hatred from the world...

So we need to support and love each other...Now the question is, do you allow
small problems to get in the way of loving other believers???

Jesus commands that we love one another, and he will give us the strength to do it...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Lord, there is so much hatred in the world today, I pray for
added strength to love as I should. I also pray that you would 
help me to be more loveable...Help me to remain faithful to Your 
command, I pray in Jesus name Amen...

Keep looking up, He will strengthen you for the tasks at hand...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
