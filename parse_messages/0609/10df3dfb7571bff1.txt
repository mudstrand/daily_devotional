GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...The hardest secret for a man to keep
is his opinion of himself...(Ro. 12:3)

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus had just told the disciples about the coming persecution and His going away,
then He says, "Because I have said these things, you are filled with grief. But I tell 
you the truth: It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away the Counselor 
will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you." (Jn. 16:6, 7) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Unless Jesus did what He came to do, there would be no Good News. If He did not die,
He could not remove our sins; He could not rise again and defeat death.

If He did not go back to the Father, the Holy Spirit would not come, Christ's presence on 
earth was limited to one place at a time. His leaving meant He could be present to the
whole world through the Holy Spirit.

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Lord, I thank you for what Your finished work on the cross 
means to each and every believer...I thank You for the workings
of the Holy Spirit. I pray for the Holy Spirit's guidance to make
me a better witness...Amen.

Keep looking up, His grace is sufficient for the day...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
