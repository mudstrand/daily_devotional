GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...The right angle to approach a difficult
problem is the "try-angle." (Lk. 1:37)

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus says: My command is this: love each other as I have loved you.
Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends...
(Jn. 15:12, 13) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Jesus Commands us to love each other has He has, and He loved us so 
much that He gave his life for us...

We may not have to die for someone, but there are other ways to practice 
sacrificial love: like listening, helping, encouraging, and giving...

Think of someone in particular who needs this kind of love today.
Give all the love you can, and then try to give a little more...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I cannot thank You enough for Your love!
Help me to always practice sacrificial love to those in need. Help
me to have a sensitive heart for those who are in need, I pray this 
all in the name of Jesus...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will help you solve your problems...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
