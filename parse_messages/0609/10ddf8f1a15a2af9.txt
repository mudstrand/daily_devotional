I couldn't agree with this more!!! 











*ATTITUDE*
*There once was a woman who woke up one morning, looked in the
mirror, and noticed she had only three hairs on her head. "Well,"
she said, "I think I'll braid my hair today." So she did, and she
had a wonderful day. *
**
*The next day she woke up, looked in the mirror and saw that she had
only two hairs on her head. "H-M-MM, " she said, "I think I'll
part my hair down the middle today." So she did, and she had a grand
day. *
**
*The next day she woke up, looked in the mirror, and noticed that
she had only one hair on her head. "Well," she said, "Today I'm
going to wear my hair in a pony tail." So she did, and she had a
fun, fun day. *
**
*The next day she woke up, looked in the mirror, and noticed that
there wasn't a single hair on her head. "YEAH!" she exclaimed, "I
don't have to fix my hair today!" *
**
*Attitude is everything!!! As the saying goes: "The kind of life
you will have isn't determined by what happens to you. It's
determined by your reaction to what happens to you. "*
**
*Be kinder than necessary, for everyone you meet is fighting some
kind of battle. *
**
*Have a better today - than yesterday!!!*
