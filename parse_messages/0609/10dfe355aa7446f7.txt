GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...If a care is too small to be turned into a prayer,
it is to small to be made into a burden. (I Pet. 5:7)

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus said to His disciples, "But when he the Spirit of truth, comes, 
he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will
speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come." (Jn 16:13) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Jesus said to the disciples that the Holy Spirit would tell them "about the future"
the nature of their mission, the opposition they would face, and the final outcome 
of their efforts...

They did not fully understand these predictions until the Holy Spirit came after Jesus'
death and resurrection. The Holy Spirit revealed truths to the disciples that they
wrote down in the books that are now the New Testament...

The truth into which the Holy Spirit guides us is the truth about Christ. The Spirit also 
helps us through patient practice to discern right from wrong...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, once again I thank You for the workings of Your Holy Spirit.
Help me to always be patient and quick to listen to his leading and guiding. Forgive 
me for allowing the busyness of each day to take control of my life. Bless my e-mail 
buddies today with good health and safety...Amen.

Look up, when you have to little strength to look within...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
