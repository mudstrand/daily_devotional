GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...Faith is daring the soul to go beyond
what the eyes can see...

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus says, "As the Father has loved Me, so I have loved you. Now remain in My love.
If you love Me remain in My love, just as I have obeyed My Father's commands and
remain in His Love. I have told you this so that My joy may be in you and that your joy
may be complete...(Jn. 15:9-11) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

When things are going well, we feel elated. when hardship comes,
we often sink into depression...

But, true joy transcends rolling waves of circumstance. True joy comes from
a consistent relationship with Jesus Christ...

When our lives are intertwined with His, He will help us walk through adversity 
without sinking into those debilitating lows, and we will be able to manage 
prosperity without moving into deceptive highs...

(In other words, our lives will remain on more of an even keel).

The joy of living with Jesus Christ daily will keep us levelheaded, no matter how 
high or low our circumstances...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you Lord for being a part of my
life. I pray that a relationship with You would become a reality
in everyone's life. I pray that everyone would come to know the
joy of your presence in their life...Amen.

Keep looking up, He wants to be a part of your life...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
