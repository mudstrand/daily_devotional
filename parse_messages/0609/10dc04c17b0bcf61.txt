LETS GO FOR IT...Subject: PRAYER TIME EACH EVENING

PRAYER TIME EACH EVENING
Someone has said that, if Christians really understood the full extent of the 
power we have available through prayer, we might be speechless. In WW.II there 
was an advisor to Churchill who organized a group of people who dropped what 
they were doing every day at a prescribed hour for one minute to collectively pray 
for the safety of England, its people and peace. 

There is now a group of people organizing the same thing here in America. If you 
would like to participate: Every evening at 9:00 pm Eastern Time (8:00 PM Central) 
(6:00 PM Pacific), stop whatever you are doing and spend one minute praying for 
the safety of the United States, our troops, our citizens, and for a return to a Godly 
nation. If you know anyone else who would like to participate, please pass this 
along.
Also pray for Israel and the "Peace of Jerusalem".
Our prayers are the most powerful asset we have. Together, we "CAN" make a 
difference! Thank You, and God Bless America.
