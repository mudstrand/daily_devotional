Our Bible Verse for Today:
"If you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your
brother has something against you, ~ leave your gift there in front of
the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and 
offer your gift. . . (Mt. 5: 23, 24)

Our Lesson for Today:
We should, never, ever disregard a conviction that the Holy Spirit brings to
our mind. If it is important enough for the Holy Spirit of God to bring it to your
mind, it is the very thing He is detecting in you. . .

Here is a question you should ask yourself. "Am I looking for some big thing
to give up, while God is telling me there are some tiny things that must go?"

Broken relationships can hinder our relationship with God. If we have a problem 
or grievance with someone, we should resolve the problem as soon as possible.
Scriptures tell us we are hypocrites and liars if we claim to love God while we hate 
others. . .

Really, our attitude toward others reflect our relationship with God (1 Jn. 4:20)

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, bring to my mind any and all grievances I have against
others so that I may confess them as sins that are really hindering 
my relationship with You. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
