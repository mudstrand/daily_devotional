Our Bible Verse for Today:
The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of this world. 
On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strong holds.
(II Cor. 10:4)

Our Lesson for Today:
In the Christian life we battle against the powerful evil forces of fallen angels
headed by Satan. . . To withstand their attacks, we must depend on God's
strength and use every piece of His armor. (Eph. 6:10-17)

Now Paul is not giving counsel only to the church, but also to individuals within
the church. The whole body needs to be armed. . . It is only by the Holy Spirit's
power that we can be victorious. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, You know that every day Satan wages new wars in my
life, without your Spirit's power I can do nothing to stand against him.
So here I am again today begging for Your strength to be victorious. . . Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
