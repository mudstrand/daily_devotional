09/03/2010~~~food for thought~~~SHARING GOD'S BLESSINGS

Our Bible Verse for Today:
The three mighty men broke through the Philistine lines, 
drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and 
carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, 
he poured it out before the Lord. (II Sam. 23:16)

Our Lesson for Today:
What has been like "water from the well of Bethlehem" to you recently ~
love ~ friendship ~ or maybe some spiritual blessing (23:16)?

Have you taken whatever it may be, even at the risk of damaging your 
own soul, simply to satisfy yourself? ~~~ If you have, then you cannot 
pour it out "to the Lord."

You can never set apart for God something that you desire for yourself
to achieve your own satisfaction. ~ If you try to satisfy yourself with a 
blessing from God, it will corrupt you. You must sacrifice it, pouring it 
out to God even if your common sense says, 'its a waste.'

Do not hoard God's blessings...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, Give me the wisdom to do what is right in Your eyes...Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
