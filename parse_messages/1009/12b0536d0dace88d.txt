09/12/2010~~~food for thought~~~SPIRITUAL CONFUSION

Our Bible Verse for Today:
(The mother of Zebedee's son's came to Jesus with a request)
"Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at Your right
and the other at the left in Your Kingdom." ~~~
"You don't know what you are asking," Jesus said to them.
"Can you drink the cup, I am going to drink?" (Mt. 20:21, 22)

Our Lesson for Today:
There are times in our spiritual life when there is confusion, and the way out 
of it is not simply to say that we should not be confused. ~ It is not a matter 
of right and wrong, but a matter of God taking us through a way that we temporarily 
do not understand. ~ But it is only by going through the spiritual confusion that 
we will come to the understanding of what God wants for us...

"When the Son of Man comes will He really find faith on the earth?" (Lk. 18:8)
Will He find the kind of faith that counts on Him in spite of the confusion?

Stand firm in faith, believing that what Jesus said is true, although in the meantime 
you do not understand what God is doing. He has bigger issues at stake than the 
particular things you are asking Him right now.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I don't always understand why I have to go through
certain trials, so I ask for the faith to stand firm while You work
it out...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
