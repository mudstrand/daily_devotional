09/21/2010~~~food for thought~~~WE HAVE A PREDESTINED PURPOSE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Now the Lord says, who formed me in the womb to
be His servant. . . (Isa. 49:5a)

Our Lesson for Today:
We must always remember the fact that God's creative purpose
for us is, to be one of His servants, and not ever confuse or cloud
it with our own intentions. . . 

If we do, God will have to force our intentions aside no matter how much
it may hurt. . . Once we realize that it is through the salvation of Jesus 
Christ that we are made perfectly fit for the purpose of God, we will
understand why Jesus Christ is so strict and relentless in His demands.

He demands absolute righteousness from His servants, because He has
put into them the very nature of God. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, Help me to never forget Your purpose for me.
Help me to also remember, that You know my every thought
word and deed. Forgive me Lord for my wayward ways. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
