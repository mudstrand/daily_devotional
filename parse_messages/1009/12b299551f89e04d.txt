09/20/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE DIVINE COMMANDMENT OF LIFE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
". . .be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect." (Mt. 5:48)

Our Lesson for Today:
How can we be perfect?
(1) 'In Character' ~ In this life we cannot be flawless, BUT we can work at
being as much like Christ as possible. . .
(2) 'In Holiness' ~ Like the Pharisees, we are to separate ourselves from
the worlds sinful values. BUT unlike the Pharisees, we are to be devoted to
God's desires rather than our own and carry His love and mercy into the world.
(3) 'In maturity' ~ we can't achieve Christ-like character and holy living all at
once, BUT we must grow toward maturity and wholeness. . .
(4) 'In love' ~ We can seek to love others as completely as God loved us. . .

We can be perfect IF our behavior is appropriate for our maturity level.
Perfect, yet with much room to grow. Our tendency to sin must never
deter us from striving to be more like Christ. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, Help me to grow and become mature in my spiritual
life so that daily I might become more Christ-like. . .Amen

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
