09/15/2010~~~food for thought~~~WHAT TO RENOUNCE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
We have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use 
deception, nor do we distort the word of God. on the contrary, by
setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every man's
conscience in the sight of God. . . (2 Cor. 4:2)

Our Lesson for Today:
Preachers, teachers, and anyone else who talks about Jesus Christ must
remember that they stand in God's presence ~ He hears every word. When
you tell people about Christ, be careful not to distort the message to please 
your audience.

Have you "renounced the hidden things of shame" in your life?
If not then renounce it as soon as it comes to mind. We must maintain continual 
watchfulness so that nothing arises in our life that would cause us shame. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to be victorious over Satan's attempts 
to ruin my witness. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
