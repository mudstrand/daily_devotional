09/14/2010~~~food for thought~~~TO MAY DISTRACTIONS

Our Bible Verse for Today:
I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning,
your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure 
devotion to Christ. . .(II Cor. 11:3)

Our Lesson for Today:
The Corintians' pure and simple devotion to Christ was being threatened
by false teaching. Paul did not want the believers to lose their simple-minded
love for Christ. . . 

Keeping Christ first in our life can be very difficult when we have so many
distractions threatening to sidetrack our faith. . .

Just as Eve lost her focus by listening to the serpent, we, too, can lose our 
focus by letting our life become overcrowded and confused. Is there anything
that weakens your commitment to keep Christ first in your life?

Let us minimize any and all distractions that threaten our devotion to Christ. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, You know that Satan puts many distractions in my life, 
so that my faith in You is often threatened. Help me Lord to be 
more focused on You. . . Amen. 
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
