09/26/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE ART OF REMEMBERING

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"If you ~~~ remember ~ that your brother has something against you. . . "
(Mt. 5:23b)

Our Lesson for Today:
This verse says, If you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember
that your brother has something against you. . ." It is not saying, "If you
search and find something because of your unbalanced sensitivity," but, 
"If you ~~~ remember. . ."

In other words, if something is brought to your conscious mind by the 
Holy Spirit of God ~ "First be reconciled to your brother, and then come
and offer your gift" (5:24).

Never object to the intense sensitivity of the Spirit of God in you when He is
instructing you down to the smallest detail. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, it is only by Your Spirit's leading that I am able 
to follow faithfully, so help me to become more sensitive 
to Your Holy Spirit. . .Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
