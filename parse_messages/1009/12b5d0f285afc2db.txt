Our Bible Verse for Today:
Yet when I preach the Gospel, I cannot boast for I am compelled
to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the Gospel ! (I Cor. 9:16)

Our Lesson for Today:
Preaching the Gospel was Paul's gift and calling, and he said he couldn't 
stop preaching even if He wanted to. ~ Paul was driven by the desire to do 
what God wanted; using his gifts for God's glory. . .

What specail gifts has God given you?
Are you motivated, like Paul to honor God with your gifts?

Like Paul, both freedom and discipline should be important tools 
to be used in God's service. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help we to de as dedicated to your service, 
as Paul was. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to The father except through me." - John: 14:6
