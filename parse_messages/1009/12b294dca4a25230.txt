09/19/2010~~~food for thought~~~ARE YOU GOING ON WITH JESUS

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Jesus says to His disciples, " "You have remained true
to Me in My trials". . . (Lk. 22:28)

Our Lesson for Today:
It is true that Jesus is with us through, but are going on with Him?
Many of us turn back from going on with Jesus the very moment
we have an experience of what He can do. . .

Watch when God changes your circumstances to see whether you
are going on with Jesus, or siding with the world, the flesh, and the 
devil. . .
We wear His name, but are we going on with Him? "From that time 
many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more." (Jn. 6:66)

Are you going on with Jesus? His voice is still calling.
"Follow Me". . .(Mt. 4:19)

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, Help me to be a true follower.
Help me to never stray from Your path. . . Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
