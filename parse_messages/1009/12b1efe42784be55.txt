09/17/2010~~~food for thought~~~IS THERE GOOD IN TEMPTATION

Our Bible Verse for Today:
No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to man.
(I Cor. 10:13a)

Our Lesson for Today:
We live in a culture much like the Corinthians did, it is a culture filled with
moral depravity and sin-inducing pressures. . .

Paul's encouragement is that, (1) Temptation happens to everyone so
don't feel you have been singled out; (2) Others have resisted temptation
and so can you; (3) any temptation can be resisted because God will
show you a way out. . .

God will help you in resisting temptation by helping you (1) recognize those
people and situations that give you trouble, (2) run from anything you know
is wrong, (3) choose to do only what is right, (4) pray for God's help, and
(5) seek friends who love God and can offer help when you are tempted. . .

Running from a tempting situation is you first step on the way to victory (2 Tim. 2:22)

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I don't always recognize temptation when it
begins, so I ask for a keener eye to what I'm getting into. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
