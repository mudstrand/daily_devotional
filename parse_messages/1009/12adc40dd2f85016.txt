Our Bible Verse for Today:
(Jesus prays for His disciples)
"I have told these men about You. They were in the world, but then
You gave them to Me. Actually they were always Yours, and You
gave them to Me: and they have kept Your Word." (Jn. 17:6)

Our Lesson for Today:
In Lk. 14:26 Jesus said: "If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his 
father. and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his 
own life also, he cannot be My disciple."

Jesus was not saying that this person cannot be good and upright, but that
he cannot be someone over whom Jesus can write the word Mine. If we are
not careful anyone of these relationships that are mentioned in (Lk. 14:26) can 
compete with our relationship with Him. 

Jesus wants to be first in our lives ~ That means He wants us to "Love less"
those mentioned in our worldly relationships and love Him more, that is what
makes us truly His...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me each and everyday to put
You first and worldly relationships second...Amen

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
