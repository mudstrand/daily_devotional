09/28/2010~~~food for thought~~~RECOGNIZING WHAT IS IMPORTANT

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Jesus said to him, "One thing you lack: Go your way, 
sell whatever you have and give to the poor. . . 
and come, take up your cross, and follow Me. (Mk. 10:21)

Our Lesson for Today:
Question: What does your money mean to you?

Although Jesus wanted this man to sell everything and give his money to the poor,
this does not mean that all believers should sell all their possessions. Most of His
followers did not sell everything, although they used their possessions to serve others.

Instead, this incident shows us that we must not let our possessions or money keep
us from following Jesus. We must remove all barriers to serving Him fully. . .

If Jesus asked, could you give up your house? ~ Your car? ~ You position on the
ladder of promotion? ~ ~ ~ Your reaction may show your attitude toward money ~
whether it is your servant or your master. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, Help me to realize who or what is truly master of my life. . . Amen. 
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
