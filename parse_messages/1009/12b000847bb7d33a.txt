09/11/2010~~~food for thought~~~MINISTERING IN EVERYDAY OPPORTUNITIES

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet,
you also should wash one another's feet. (Jn. 13:14)

Our Lesson for Today:
Jesus said, "I have given you an example, that you should do as I have
done to you" (Jn. 13:15). . .

Take notice of the kind of people that God brings around you, and you will
be humiliated once you realize that this is actually His way of revealing to you
the kind of person you have been to Him. Now He says we should exhibit to 
those around us exactly what He has exhibited to us. . .

Do you find yourself responding by saying, "Oh, I will do all that once I'm
out on the mission field"? ~ Talking in this way is like trying to produce the
weapons of war while in the trenches of the battlefield ~ you will be killed 
while trying to do it. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, Help me to minister in my everyday opportunities,
so that I will be more prepared when a real crisis comes. . . Amen. 

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
