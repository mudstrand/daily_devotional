09/05/2010~~~food for thought~~~WATCHING WITH JESUS

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Then Jesus told them, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point
of death. . . Stay here and keep watch with Me."

Our Lesson for Today:
We see here that Jesus was in great anguish over His approaching physical
pain, separation from the Father, and death for the sins of the whole world.
The divine course was set, but He, in His human nature, still struggled (Heb. 5:7-9).

Because of the anguish Jesus experienced, He can relate to our suffering.
Jesus' strength to obey came from His relationship with God the Father, who
is also the source of our strength (Jn. 17:11, 15-16, 21, 26).

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I long for a closer relationship with You,
so that I can stand against the powers of this world...Amen

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
