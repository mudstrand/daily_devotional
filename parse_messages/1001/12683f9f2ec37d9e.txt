01/31/2010~~~food for thought~~~WHERE HAVE YOU PUT YOUR TRUST???

Our Bible Verse for Today:
They (the disciples) woke Him (Jesus), saying, "Lord, save us!
We're going to drown!" (Mt. 8:25)

Our Lesson for Today:
Are you having trouble falling asleep at night? An elderly gentlemen was asked
how he could fall asleep so fast. His answer was "I just say my prayers to Jesus
out loud and roller over and go to sleep. There is no use in both of us staying awake."
This gentlemen had learned the secret of sleeping through the storms of life.

The disciples had done everything they had learned to do as seamen but to no avail.
their seaman skills did no good. They even were beginning to think that Jesus was
no good as He slept, seemingly unconcerned. How wrong they were!

He had come from heaven to rescue them from the hurricane of sin. He would go to
the cross so that with nail-pierced hands He could invite sin-tossed souls, "Come
to me,...and I will give you rest." (Mt. 11:28)

When such loving, almighty hands are wrapped around the stomas of life, those who sail
with God are safe. Perhaps the disciples didn't roll over and fall asleep the next time
they ran into a storm out on the lake ~ BUT they trusted that their Jesus wasn't sleeping 
either. It's not that we should stop rowing, BUT that we should start trusting Jesus in the 
storms of life...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to trust that there is pardon for all my sins,
in the wounds of Your hands; AND that there is relief in Your 
hands from all of life's storms...Amen.

The Lord said, "the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
