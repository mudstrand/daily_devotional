01/30/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE BIBLE TELLS ME SO...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
The centurion replied, "Lord, I do not deserve to have You come under my roof.
But just say the word, and my servant will be healed." (Mt. 8:8)

Our Lesson for Today:
What's faith? " A mask for hypocrites," some reply. "A wheelchair for weaklings,"
say others. Others say, "Useless foolishness." Others may say, "Its like blind people
chattering about color."

A much more important question, On what does faith rest? The centurion could
answer that question. He wasn't looking for a sign. He didn't even ask Jesus to come
to his house. All he wanted was Christ's promise. "Just say the word," he said full
of trust, "and my servant will be healed."

Yes God's Word is the only solid foundation for faith. "Jesus loves me, this I know,
for the Bible tells me so," is the only sure song for faith. Because the Bible says so, 
I believe that Jesus paid for my sins with His precious blood and innocent death.

Because Jesus promised, I believe that all who the Spirit brings to faith in Him will 
not perish but have eternal life...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to say with the centurion,
"Just say the Word," and I will be saved...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
