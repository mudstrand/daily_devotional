01/29/2010~~~food for thought~~~NEVER TO THIRST AGAIN...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst...(Jn. 4:14)

Our Lesson for Today:
Though many do not feel it or admit it, their souls beg for relief from the
burning anguish of sin. In their ignorance and stubbornness, they turn to
the world's wells. But like an alcoholic, the more they drink the less their
thirst is quenched...

Instead of labeling these wells as "unsafe for human consumption,"
Satan disguises the spouts to deceive the thirsty traveler. But the time
comes when the wells of power, possession, pleasure, and philosophy,
where people have let down their buckets of an extravagant life style, will
come to find that it is only poison for their soul...

There is only one well that can quench the soul's thirst. Jesus said it clearly, 
"Whoever drinks the water I give Him will never thirst." With His atoning death 
on Calvary's holy mountain, He opened the pure and healing fountain that
flows to you, to me, to all...

Now He channels His thirst-quenching forgiveness to us through the riverbeds
of the Word and sacraments. if all who lived on the earth were to come and drink,
never could they drain His forgiveness dry...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, draw me to Your Word and lead me to drink
deeply of the water of life You offer...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
