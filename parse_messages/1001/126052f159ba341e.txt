01/07/10~~~food for thought~~~THANK GOD FOR THIS SNOW

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow...(Isa. 1:18)

Our Lesson for Today:
Some people like snow, at least the first snow of the winter.
The beautiful white flakes cover earth's dead vegetation and everything looks so pure.
But when snow keeps coming or shows up in spring, the grumbling begins...

Thank God for this snow. How could we get up and start another day without
the promise of His forgiveness? ~ How could we go to bed each night without
the assurance, "Were as scarlet my transgression, it shall be as white as snow
by Your blood and bitter passion" (Christian Worship 304:6)?

Even more, how could we ever face eternity, where we need to be white as snow
in the Judge's sight? ~ Regardless of where we live or how many snowflakes we
see each winter, we can never get to much of this snow...

Prayer Suggestion:
Cover me, Lord, with Your Son's forgiveness that
I might be pure in Your sight...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
