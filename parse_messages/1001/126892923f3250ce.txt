02/01/2010~~~food for thought~~~"SHINE, JESUS, SHINE"

Our Bible Verse for Today:
He [Jesus] said, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me will
never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life." (Jn. 8:12)

Our Lesson for Today:
Batteries are getting better all the time. But sooner or later they fail. But not so with Jesus.
Like some all-powerful searchlight, He penetrates the dense midnight of sin, pushes aside
the darkness of death, and points the way through earth's gloom to heaven...

Not only does He light the way; He is the way. With His death and resurrection, He paid for sin
and now stands like some well-lit ladder to heaven. With His redemptive work, He's the laser that 
beams us up to eternity...

Jesus stands revealed in Scripture as the lasting light of salvation for all times...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, Light of the world, shine upon us, set us 
free by the truth you now bring us...Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
