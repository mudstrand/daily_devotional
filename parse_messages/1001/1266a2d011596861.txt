01/26/2010~~~food for thought~~~A CHILD OF GOD...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we
should be called children of God! (1 Jn. 3:1a)

Our Lesson for Today:
What is the greatest blessing we enjoy in our earthly families?
It's love, isn't it? If love is absent, we can have the best of food
and clothing, you name it, and yet we have nothing...

As believers, our self-worth is based on the fact that God loves us
and calls us His children. YES we are His children now, not sometime 
in the distant future...

Yes, we are members of God's family, His children.
And, knowing that we are His children should encourage 
us to live as Jesus did.

The Christian life is a process of becoming more and more 
like Christ. (Ro 8:29)

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to grow day by day in the likeness
of Your Son...Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
