01/09/10~~~food for thought~~~MAY THE SNOW DO IT'S JOB...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it
without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish ~ so is my word
that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to Me empty, but will accomplish
what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it...(Isa. 55:10, 11)

Our lesson for Today:
A pastor who had shared God's Word finally gave up, because the person 
continually rejected him. Then weeks after giving up, his phone rang, it was the
very same person asking to join the church. What he couldn't do, the Lord had
done. The young pastor had learned a valuable lesson. His job was to share the 
Word; the Lord's job was to make it work in the human heart...

Just as God decides where and when the snow will fall, so He determines where
and when His Word will bring dead hearts to faith. If only we could see the Holy
Spirit at work through that powerful Word, we would be more encouraged in our
attempts to share it...

Since we can't we need to remember this important truth: Our job is to share the 
snow, (word) not to make it grow...

So let it snow! on your relatives, neighbors, friends, coworkers fellow students 
whoever. They need the life-giving message of their only Savior from sin and
only deliverer from death...

Into our hands God has placed His Word. In His hands rests the results He
has promised...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I ask Your blessing upon our sharing of Your powerful Word.
Use it to bring dead hearts to life. And give us the patients to wait on the results...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
