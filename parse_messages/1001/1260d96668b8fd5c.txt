01/08/10~~~food for thought~~~THE DIVINE WEATHERMAN...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
He sends the snow like white wool...(Ps. 147:16a)

Our Lesson for Today:
It goes without saying that the psalmist knew who made it snow ~ so do we...
When the road home from work is snow covered and slippery, the driveway
plugged by the passing snowplow, the side walk almost buried under the drifting 
snow, do we stop to think who sent the it???

If we have to start the snowblower and do the shoveling we're not to tickled.
Next time it snows, stop for a moment and consider the hand behind it. Remember
its the hand of our almighty God. ~ He alone fills the clouds with moisture ~ forms 
the snow flakes ~ and sends them fluttering down...

It's our all-knowing God who waters the fields ~ fills the reservoirs ~ and provides for 
His creatures. His divine hand sends not only the snow but everything else good for
His children...

Yes from this divine weatherman we look for weather that is always ~ "fair."
But remember for the flowers we appreciate so much there must also be rain...
Difficulties strengthen our faith as labor does the body...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to see your hand at work in the
changing seasons of my life, help me to appreciate
the fact that if it was always fair, my faith would not
be as strong as it is...Amen.

No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
