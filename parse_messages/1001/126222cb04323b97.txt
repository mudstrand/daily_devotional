01/12.10~~~food for thought~~~ALWAYS IN FASHION...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
It seems that the thing most talked about for the coming year in fashions is,
how long or short will the dresses be, what colors will be in, what about accessories? 
Will men's suits be double breasted, or have three buttons...

Christians know something about proper dress. In fact, only Christians know
about the right clothing for heaven. The garments of salvation are not union made
but divinely tailored. They carry no dry-cleaning labels but are always pressed
and spotless...

They are not made for hanging in the closet but for everyday wear. And they are
the only dress that gets us into heaven's party. At our baptism God clothed us with 
the garments of His salvation. By His grace, Christ's forgiveness covered us and
His holiness counted for us...

Through His Word, as we hear and read it, He wraps that beautiful robe more tightly
around us and fastens its buttons more securely. When our final day comes, it will
be His doing that we can step "clothed in His righteousness alone, faultless to
stand before His throne."

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, please let Your blood and righteousness
by my beauty and my glorious dress...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6

Today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday...
