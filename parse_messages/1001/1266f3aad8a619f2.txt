01/27/2010~~~food for thought~~~HANDS GREAT ENOUGH TO FULFILL ANY NEED...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water;" so they filled them
to the brim. Then He told them, "Now draw some out and take it to the
master of the banquet." They did so, and the master of the banquet
tasted the water that had been turn into wine...(Jn. 2:7-9)

Our lesson for Today:
At this wedding it wasn't long before some needs arose. To us the lack of wine
may not seem serious, but to this bridegroom and bride it meant embarrassment. 
But the heavenly guest took care of their need. When the servants carried the cupful 
from the water-fill jars to the caterer of the feast, it was obvious what Jesus had done.
Miraculously that cup now contained wine far better wine than what the bridegroom had
originally provided...

Want to talk about needs? How can we help it? Daily life is filled with them. What can we 
do about those large ones, like the stain cause by sin, the pressures of those special 
sins, the weaknesses when it comes to daily temptations???

Where can we turn with those lesser and yet weighty cares, like a loved one in the
hospital, a wayward child in our home, a job on shaky ground???

Let the miracle at Cana remind us! Jesus first miracle was not to stop pain or heal
a disease but to make wine at a wedding, as a reminder that our needs, big or small, 
are seen and satisfied by Him...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, remind me that Your hands are strong
enough to handle all my needs...Amen.

No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
