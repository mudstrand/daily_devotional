I received this from a friend in S. D. It will be worth your time to read this warning...







Subject: E-Mail tracking


While I love the fuzzy warm forwards, I hate the evil scheming behind them. We need 
to be as "wise as a serpent and harmless as a dove."







Subject: Fwd: Fw: E-Mail tracking - please read




Dear All, 

Guess what? You never have to feel guilty about NOT forwarding an email 
again!! Please read the info below from snopes.com. You will be glad you 
did! It isn't long, 

The man that sent this information is a computer tech. He spends a lot of 
time clearing the junk off computers for people and listens to complaints 
about speed. All forwards are not bad, just some. Be sure you read the 
very last paragraph. 

Please read : 

By now, I suspect everyone is familiar with www.snopes.com and/or 
www.truthorfiction.com for determining whether information received via 
email is just that: true/false or fact/fiction. Both are excellent 
sites. 

Advice from Snopes.com Very important! 


1) Any time you see an E-Mail that says forward this on to ' 10 ' (or 
however many) of your friends, sign this petition, or you'll get bad luck, 
or good luck, or you'll see something funny on your screen after you send it, or 
whatever, it almost always has an E-Mail tracker program attached that 
tracks the cookies and E-Mails of those folks you forward to. 

The host sender is getting a copy each time it gets forwarded and then is 
able to get lists of 'active ' E-Mail addresses to use in SPAM E-Mails, or 
sell to other spammers. Even when you get emails that demand you send the 
email on if you' re not ashamed of God/Jesus .....that's E-mail tracking 
and 
they' re playing on our conscience. These people don' t care how they get 
your email addresses - just as long as they get them. Also, emails that 
talk about a missing child or a child with an incurable disease "how 
would 
you feel if that was your child".... Email Tracking!!! Ignore them and 
don't participate! 


2) Almost all E-Mails that ask you to add your name and forward on to 
others 
are similar to that mass letter years ago that asked people to send 
business 
cards to the little kid in Florida who wanted to break the Guinness Book 
of 
Records for the most cards. All it was, and all any of this type of E-Mail 
is, is a way to get names and cookie ' tracking information for 
telemarketers and spammers - - to validate active E-Mail accounts for 
their 
own profitable purposes. 


You can do your Friends and Family members a GREAT favor by sending this 
information to them; you will be providing a service to your Friends, and 
will be rewarded by not getting thousands of spam E-Mails in the future! 

Do yourself a favor and STOP adding your name(s) to those types of 
listings 
regardless how inviting they might sound!....or make you feel guilty if 
you 
don't!... it's all about getting email addresses - nothing more! 

You may think you are supporting a GREAT cause, but you are NOT! Instead, 
you will be getting tons of junk mail later and very possibly a virus 
attached! Plus, we are helping the spammers get rich! Let's not make it 
easy 
for them! 

Also: E-Mail petitions are NOT acceptable to Congress or any other 
organization - i.e. social security, etc. To be acceptable, petitions must 
have a signed signature and full address of the person signing the 
petition, 
so this is a waste of time and you're just helping the Email trackers.
