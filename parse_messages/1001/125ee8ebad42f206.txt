01/02/10~~~food for thought~~~A NEW YEAR BUT THE SAME PARDON...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
I will forgive their wickedness and will remember
their sins no more...(Jer. 31:34)

Our Lesson for Today:
What can you do with that water stain on the ceiling?
Try covering it with ordinary paint, but it still bleeds through.
Buy the special paint made to cover such stains, but you still see
its faint outline each time you look at the ceiling...

Don't we sometimes act as if God deals the same way with our sins?
Don't we sometimes act as if Jesus merely covered them over and yet they're still there?

Why? Didn't you notice what the gracious Lord said? He does more than cover our sins ~
He removes them. He doesn't even remember our sins. Our sins are gone as if they never
existed. All because He sent His Son to pay for them on Calvary's cross...

Thank God we don't have to enter the new year with the stains of last year's sins upon us.
They're totally gone ~ blotted out completely by the precious blood of the Savior.
Oh yes there will be sins in this new year too ~ there will be plenty of them.
Old familiar ones that we fight against and yet fall back into. New ones that we stumble into
because they sneak up on us. What shall we do, what can we do, with all their wretched stains?

The same thing we did last year. Bring them with tears of repentance to God, and thank Him
each day of this new year for forgiving our sins and remembering them no more...

Prayer Suggestion:
Thank You, Lord, for Your forgiveness that 
remains new for us each day...Amen.
