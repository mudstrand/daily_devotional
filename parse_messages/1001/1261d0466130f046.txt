01/11/10~~~food for thought~~~SAFE IN OUR FATHER'S ARMS...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
God is our refuge and strength, always ready to help
in times of trouble...(Ps 46:1)

Our lesson for Today:
In the following verses the psalmist writes about the fear of earthquakes and such.
Today people fear terrorist attacks and the economy crumbling and such...

But the psalmist says even if the world ends, we need not fear. In the face of complete 
destruction, the writer expressed a quiet confidence in God's ability to save him. Yes,
it does seem impossible to consider the end of the world without becoming consumed
by fear but the Bible is clear ~ God is our refuge even in the midst of total destruction.

He is not merely a temporary retreat: He is our eternal refuge and can provide strength 
in any circumstance...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I am weak, but You are strong. Carry me
each day and into the eternal day...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
It is not how long but how well we live that matters...
