01/22/2010~~~food for thought~~~WHAT DOES JESUS HAVE TO SAY?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"The time has come." He said. "The kingdom of God is near.
Repent and believe the Good News!" (Mk. 1:5)

Our Lesson for Today:
What Jesus has to say can be summed up with four Rs.

He tells us to realize that we have sinned ~ More times than we can count,
more ways than we can remember.

He tells us to regret that we have sinned ~ Not just to mouth the words "I'm sorry"
but to hang our heads in shame before our Holy Father.

Then He tells us to rely on His full forgiveness to cover those sins ~ To find in Him
the pardon we need and the peace to stand before our loving Father again.

Last of all, He tells us to resolve to fight against our sins ~ Not just take His pardon
and run but to promise with His power to amend our sinful lives...

Remember there is no shelf life on Jesus' message of repentance. What He has to 
say never goes out of date regardless of how many new years come. Sinners like
you and me need to hear again and again His important words, "Repent and believe 
the Good News."

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, open my ears to hear and my heart
to receive Your Good News...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
