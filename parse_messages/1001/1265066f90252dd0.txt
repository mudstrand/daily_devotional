01/21/2010~~~food for thought~~~HE KNOWS ME...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"How do you know me?" Nathaniel asked. Jesus answered,
"I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip
called you." Then Nathanael declared, "Rabbi, You are the Son
of God; You are the King of Israel." (Jn. 1:48, 49)

Our Lesson for Today:
The two had never met before that day. Yet the One knew the other perfectly.
Jesus knew Nathaniel's name and character, what he had been doing, and
what he needed... Sound familiar???

Jesus knows us too. He knows the sudden sins that sweep down on us like a 
tornado. He knows the wreckage they leave on our conscience. and He knows
the daily sins that are as close to us as our skin ~ that we don't always recognize 
as wrong...

Like Nathanael, who was looking for the Savior to come, we need Jesus. And He
knows this. So He speaks to us through His Word. He tells us that He forgives us 
because He's already paid for our sins...

Like Nathanael, its time for us to say joyfully, and thankfully, "Jesus, You are the Son
of God, my eternal King, my beloved Savior."

Prayer Suggestion:
Thank You, Jesus, for being my Savior and for the
heaven you have waiting for me...Amen

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
