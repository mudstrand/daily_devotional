In the new year let us remember:
Full usefulness depends on new thoughts and new horizons.
Life must look to the future, not to the past.

So let us always:
Take time to live ~ it is the secret of success.
Take time to think ~ it is the source of power.
Take time to play ~ it is the secret of youth.
Take time to read ~ it is the foundation of knowledge.
Take time for friendship ~ it is the source of happiness.
Take time to laugh ~ it helps lift life's load.
Take time to dream ~ it hitches the soul to the stars.
Take time for God~ It is life's only lasting investment.

Remember the New Year offers us a new chance.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
