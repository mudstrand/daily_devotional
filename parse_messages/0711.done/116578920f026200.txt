Subject: WORST VIRUS EVER --- CNN ANNOUNCED

I went to snopes and checked this out. Its is a real and very nasty virus. check it out yourself by going to http://www.snopes.com/computer/virus/postcard.asp

PLEASE

SEND THIS TO EVERYONE ON YOUR CONTACT LIST!!

A new virus has just been discovered that has been classified by 
Microsoft as the most destructive ever. This virus was discovered yesterday 
afternoon by McAfee . This virus simply destroys Sector Zero from the hard < BR> disk, where vital information for its functioning are stored.
This virus acts in the following manner:
It sends itself automatically to all contacts on your list with 
the title:
"You've received a Post Card from a Family member".

As soon as the supposed virtual card is opened the computer 
freezes so
that the user has to r eboot. When the ctrl+alt+ del keys or the 
reset button are pressed, the virus destroys Sector Zero, thus permanently 
destroying the hard disk. Yesterday in just a few hours this virus caused 
panic in New York , according to news broadcast by CNN.

This alert was received by an employee of Microsoft itself.
So don't open any mails with subject: "A Post Card from ." As soon 
as you get the mail, delete it !! Even if you know the sender !!!

Please pass this mail to all of your friends.
