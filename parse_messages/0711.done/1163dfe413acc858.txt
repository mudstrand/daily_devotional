This better be a wake-up call to every Christian!



Are We Going To Stay Asleep?

PLEASE READ ENTIRE E-MAIL.

SUBJECT: No more Joel Olsteen, TD Jakes, Eddie Long, Joyce Meyer, Kay
Arthur, Creflo Dollar, or Charles Stanley????

Dr. Dobson is going on CNBC to urge every Christian to get involved.
I hope you will sign and forward to all your family and friends.
An organization has been granted a Federal Hearing on the same subject by
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in Washington , D.C. Their
petition, Number 2493, would ultimately pave the way to stop the reading of
the gospel of our Lord and Savior, on the airwaves of America . They got
287,000 signatures to back their stand! If this attempt is successful, all
Sunday worship services being broadcast on the radio or by television will
be stopped.

This group is also campaigning to remove all Christmas programs and
Christmas carols from public schools! You as a Christian can help! We are
praying for at least 1 million signatures. This would defeat their effort
and show that there are many Christians alive, well and concerned about our
country.

As Christians, we must unite on this. Please don't take this lightly.
We ignored one lady once and lost prayer in our schools and in offices
across the nation. Please stand up for your religious freedom and let your
voice be heard. Together we can make a difference in our country while
creating an opportunity for the lost to know the Lord.

Please press forward, CLEAN UP THE MESSAGE, and forward this to everyone you
think should read this. Now, please sign your name at the bottom (you can
only add your name after you have pressed "Forward"or (cut and paste the
text). Don't delete any other names, just go to the next number and type
your name. Please do not sign jointly, such as Mr. & Mrs., each person
should sign his/her own name. Please defeat this organization and keep the
right of our freedom of religion. When you get to 1000 please e-mail back
to: Lisa Norman email address is electric_yello@ hotmail.com

must hit the forward button first and then you can go to the bottom
of the list, add your name then forward it on to your friends. So
many people do not know this and are forwarding it without their
names added.
