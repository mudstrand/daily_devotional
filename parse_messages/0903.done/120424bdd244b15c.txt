Our Bible Verse for Today:

"Oh, give thanks unto the Lord; for He is good:
for His mercy endureth forever." (Ps. 136:1)

Our Lesson for Today:

This particular Psalm is devoted to the praise of God's mercy:
In each of the twenty-six verses we have the expression: 
"His mercy endureth forever."

The Psalmist was full of this wonderful thought. Our hearts too
should be filled with this blessed assurance. The everlasting,
unchangeable mercy of God is cause for unceasing praise
and thanksgiving...

Please take time to read about God's mercy in the well-known
Psalm 103...

Oh, how often we read these familiar words without the least thought
of their immeasurable greatness! Be still and meditate until the heart
responds to the words of this wonderful Psalm...

Prayer Suggestion:
Take time to thank God for His wonderful mercy
and loving kindness...
