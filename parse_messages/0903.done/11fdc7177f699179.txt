Our Bible Verses for Today:

Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen?
it is God who justifies...

Who is he who condemns? Christ Jesus, who died, more than that,
who was raised to life, is at the right hand of God and is also interceding
for us...

Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship
or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword???

As it is written: "for your sake we face death all day long we are considered
as sheep to be slaughtered."

No, in all these things we are more than conquers through Him who loved us...
(Ro 8:33-37)

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul is speaking of all the things that seem likely to separate a saint from 
the love of God. But the remarkable thing is that nothing can come between
the love of God and a saint...

The things that Paul mentions in these verses can and do disrupt the close
fellowship of our soul with God and separate our natural life with Him. But 
none of them is able to come between the love of God and the soul of a Christian
on the spiritual level...

The underlining foundation of the Christian faith is the undeserved, limitless
miracle of the love of God that was exhibited on the Cross of Calvary, a love
that is not earned and can never be...

This is the reason Paul says, "in all these things we are more than conquerors."

Prayer Suggestion:
Thank You Lord for the Victory we have in Jesus!

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather

As you might have noticed this is for Sat.
I'm sending it early as I am taking the computer to the shop
I don't know exactly when I will get it back
Don't forget to set your clocks ahead... God-Bless
