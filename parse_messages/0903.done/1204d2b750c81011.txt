Payback is fun!!!!!!!!!!!! WRITE IT ON YOUR ENVELOPES WE THINK THIS IS A GREAT IDEA. WE'LL START WRITING IT ON THE FRONT OF OUR ENVELOPES, TOO! ! Including Bills

You may have heard in the news that a couple of Post Offices in Texas have been forced to take down small posters that say

'IN GOD WE TRUST ,' The law,they say, is being violated. 

Anyway, we heard proposed on a radio show, that we should all write ''IN GOD WE TRUST" 
on the back of all our mail. After all, that's our National Motto, and it's on all the money we use to buy those stamps. We think it's a wonderful idea. 

We must take back our nation from all the people who think that anything that offends them should be removed. 

If you like this idea, please pass it on and DO IT. The idea of writing or stamping, 
"IN GOD WE TRUST" on our envelopes sounds good to us . WE'RE HAVING A STAMP MADE ! Heck,lets use it as our signature on e-mails too!
It's been reported ,that 86% of Americans believe in God. Therefore, we have a very hard time understanding why there's such a mess about having "In God We Trust!"on our money and having "God" in OUR "Pledge of Allegiance". 

Could it be that WE just need to take action and tell the 14% to "Sit down and shut up"? 

If you agree, pass this on, if not, delete!!! BUT REMEMBER IF YOU DELETE THIS,that's 1 reason why this world is in the mess we're in now.WE SIT BACK & LET IT HAPPEN!!
