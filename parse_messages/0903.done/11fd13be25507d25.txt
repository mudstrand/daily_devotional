Wed. 4/09~~~food for thought~~~Is this true of YOU? (Acts 20:24).

Our Bible Verse for Today:

However, I consider my life worth nothing to me, if only I may 
finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given
me, the task of testifying to the Gospel of God's grace...(Acts 20:24)

Our Lesson for Today:

It is easier to serve or work for God without a vision and without a call,
because then you are not bothered by what He requires. Common
sense covered with a layer of Christian emotion, becomes our guide...

You may be more prosperous and successful from the world's perspective, 
and will have more leisure time, if you never acknowledge the call of God.

But once you receive a commission from Jesus Christ, the memory of what 
God asks of you will always be there to prod you on to do His will. You will no 
longer be able to work for Him on the basis of common sense...

What do you count in your life as "dear to you?" If you have not been seized 
by Jesus Christ and have not surrendered yourself to Him, you will merely 
consider the time you decide to give God and your own ideas of service dear.

Paul said he considered his life dear so that he might fulfill the ministry he had 
received, and he refuses to use his energy on anything else. Paul was absolutely 
indifferent to any consideration other than that of fulfilling the ministry he had
received...

Never consider whether or not you are of use, but always consider that 
"YOU ARE NOT YOUR OWN" (I Cor. 6:19). You are His...

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray that your wants and wishes are in accord with His will.
Pray that He would strengthen you for His service...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
