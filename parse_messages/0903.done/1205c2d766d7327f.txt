Being a Grandparent...



1. She was in the bathroom, putting on her makeup, under the watchful

eyes of her young granddaughter, as she'd done many times before. After

she applied her lipstick and started to leave, the little one said, 'But

Gramma, you forgot to kiss the toilet paper good-bye!' I will probably

never put lipstick on again without thinking about kissing the toilet

paper good-bye!!



2. My young grandson called the other day to wish me Happy Birthday.

He asked me how old I was, and I told him, '62.' He was quiet for a

moment, and then he asked, 'Did you start at 1?'



3. After putting her grandchildren to bed, a grandmother changed into

old slacks and a droopy blouse and proceeded to wash her hair. As she

heard the children getting more and more rambunctious, her patience grew

thin. Finally, she threw a towel around her head and stormed into their

room, putting them back to bed with stern warnings. As she left the

room, she heard the three-year-old say with a trembling voice, 'Who was

THAT?'



4. A grandmother was telling her little granddaughter what her own

childhood was like: 'We used to skate outside on a pond. I had a swing

made from a tire; it hung from a tree in our front yard. We rode our

pony. We picked wild raspberries in the woods.' The little girl was

wide-eyed, taking this all in. At last she said, 'I sure wish I'd

gotten to know you sooner!'



5. My grandson was visiting one day when he asked, 'Grandma, do you

know how you and God are alike?' I mentally polished my halo and I

said, 'No, how are we alike?'' You're both old,' he replied.



6. A little girl was diligently pounding away on her grandfather's

word processor. She told him she was writing a story. 'What's it

about?' he asked. 'I don't know,' she replied. 'I can't read.



7. I didn't know if my granddaughter had learned her colors yet, so I

decided to test her. I would point out something and ask what color it

was. She would tell me and was always correct. It was fun for me, so I

continued. At last she headed for the door, saying, 'Grandma, I think

you should try to figure out some of these yourself!'



8. When my grandson Melvin and I entered our vacation cabin, we kept

the lights off until we were inside to keep from attracting pesky

insects. Still, a few fireflies followed us in. Noticing them before I

did, Billy whispered, 'It's no use Grandpa. Now the mosquitoes are

coming after us with flashlights.'



9. When my grandson asked me how old I was, I teasingly replied, 'I'm

not sure.' 'Look in your underwear, Grandpa,' he advised. 'Mine says

I'm four to six.'



10.. A second grader came home from school and said to her

grandmother, 'Grandma, guess what? We learned how to make babies

today.' The grandmother, more than a little surprised, tried to keep

her cool. 'That's interesting,' she said, 'how do you make babies?

''It's simple,' replied the girl. 'You just change 'y' to 'i' and add

'es'.'



11. Children's Logic: 'Give me a sentence about a public servant,' 

said a teacher. The small boy wrote: 'The fireman came down the ladder

pregnant.' The teacher took the lad aside to correct him. 'Don't you

know what pregnant means?' she asked. 'Sure,' said the young boy

confidently. 'It means carrying a child.'



12. A nursery school teacher was delivering a station wagon full of

kids home one day when a fire truck zoomed past. Sitting in the front

seat of the truck was a Dalmatian dog. The children started discussing

the dog's duties. 'They use him to keep crowds back,' said one child.

'No,' said another,

'He's just for good luck .' A third child brought the argument to a

close. 'They use the dogs,' she said firmly, 'to find the fire

hydrants!'





WHAT IS A GRANDPARENT?

(Taken from papers written by a class of 8-year-olds)



Grandparents are a lady and a man who have no little children of their

own. They like other people's.



A grandfather is a man and a grandmother is a lady!



Grandparents don't have to do anything except be there when we come to

see them. They are so old they shouldn't play hard or run. It is good

if they drive us to the shops and give us money.



When they take us for walks, they slow down past things like pretty

leaves and caterpillars.



They show us and talk to us about the colors of the flowers and also why

we shouldn't step on cracks.'



They don't say, 'Hurry up.'



Usually grandmothers are fat but not too fat to tie your shoes.



They wear glasses and funny underwear.



They can take their teeth and gums out.



Grandparents don't have to be smart. 



They have to answer questions like 'Why isn't God married?' and 'How

come dogs chase cats?'



When they read to us, they don't skip. They don't mind if we ask for

the same story over again.



Everybody should try to have a grandmother, especially if you don't

have television because they are the only grownups who like to spend

time with us.



They know we should have snack time before bed time, and they say

prayers with us and kiss us even when we've acted bad.



A 6-YEAR-OLD WAS ASKED WHERE HIS GRANDMA LIVED. ''OH,'' HE SAID, ''SHE

LIVES AT THE AIRPORT, AND WHEN WE WANT HER, WE JUST GO GET HER. THEN

WHEN WE'RE DONE HAVING HER VISIT, WE TAKE HER BACK TO THE AIRPORT.''



GRANDPA IS THE SMARTEST MAN ON EARTH! HE TEACHES ME GOOD THINGS, BUT I

DON'T GET TO SEE HIM ENOUGH TO GET AS SMART AS HIM!



It's funny when they bend over; you hear gas leaks, and they blame their

dog.





Send this to other grandparents, almost grandparents, or heck, send it

to everyone! It will make their month!!!
