Fri. 06/09~~~food for thought~~~Ask yourself when you read the verse below,
"Is this me?"

Our Bible Verse for Today:

We put no stumbling block in anyone's path so that our ministry
(or life) will not be discredited.

Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way:
in great endurance; in troubles, hardships and distresses;
(2 Cor. 6:3, 4)

Our Lesson for Today:

When you have no vision from God, no enthusiasm left in your life,
and no one watching and encouraging you, it requires the grace of
Almighty God to take the next step in your devotion to Him...

This is what is needed in the reading and study of His Word, 
in your family life, and in your duty to Him. It takes much more
of the grace of God, and a much greater awareness of drawing
upon Him, to take that next step, than it does to preach the Gospel...

Every Christian must experience the essence of the incarnation by
bringing the next step down into flesh-and-blood reality and by working
it out with His hands...

We need to be careful so as to not lose interest and give up when we have
no vision, no encouragement, and no improvement, but only experience 
our every day trivial tasks...

The thing that really testifies for God and for the people of God in the
long run is steady perseverance, even when the work can not be seen 
by others. The only way to live an undefeated life is to live looking
to God...

Never allow yourself to think that some tasks are beneath your dignity
or to insignificant for you to do, remind yourself of the example of
Christ in (Jn. 13:1-17)

Prayer Suggestion:
Ask God to keep the eyes of your spirit open to the risen Christ,
and His example...
