Our Bible Verses for Today:

Holy Father, keep them and care for them, all those You have 
given Me, so that they will be united just as we are...Jn. 17:11

Our Lesson for Today:

Christ is our intercessor and lives to pray this great prayer. 
Expect and appropriate God's answer...

Listen to Paul's words in I Thess.

"Night and day praying exceedingly that the Lord may establish
your hearts unblameable in holiness before God" (3:10-13)

"The very God of peace sanctify you wholly" (5:23)

Consider thoughtfully these words as you read them and use them
as a prayer to God: "Blessed Lord, strengthen my heart to be
unblameable in holiness. God Himself sanctify me wholly. God is
faithful, who will also do it."

What a privilege to commune with God in secret, to speak these
words in prayer, and then wait upon Him until through the working 
of the Spirit, they live in out hearts, and we begin to know something
of the holiness of God...

Our Prayer for Today:
Today let us pray for a holy fear and a strong desire to live
in the fullness of faith...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
