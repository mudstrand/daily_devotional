03/28/09~~~food for thought~~~God wants us to place our time in His hands...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

"How sweet are Thy words unto my taste! yea, 
sweeter than honey to my mouth!" (Ps. 119:103)

Our Lesson for Today:

The more you read the Psalms the more you will realize that this 
book was written to help us worship God. We should realize that
out of the 66 books of the Bible the book of Psalms was given 
especially for this purpose...

The other books were given as historical, or doctrinal or practical.
But the Psalms take us into the inner sanctuary of God's holy presence
to enjoy the blessedness of fellowship with Him...

It is a book of devotions inspired by the Holy Spirit...

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray that the Psalms would become one of the most loved
books of the Bible and that it's prayers and teaching concerning
God would draw you continually up to God in the blessed
consciousness of His power and love...
