GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Believe in miracles...

Our Meditation for Today:

No longer will a man teach his neighbor, or a man his
brother, saying know the Lord, because they will all
know me, from the least of them to the greatest...(Heb. 8:11) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Under God's new covenant, God's law is inside us. It is no longer
an external set of rules and principles...

The Holy Spirit reminds us of Christ's words, activates our conscience,
influences our motives and desires, and makes us want to obey...

Now doing God's will is something we desire with all our heart and mind...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the work of Your Holy Spirit,
activating my conscience which influences my thoughts and actions.
I thank You for His leading and guiding leading me to do God's will
day by day...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
