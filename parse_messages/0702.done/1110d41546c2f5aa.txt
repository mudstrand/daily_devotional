This is the day the Lord has made!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Growing old beats the alternative--dying young...

Our Meditation for Today:

The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled
on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so they are
outwardly clean...

How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the 
eternal Spirit offered Himself unblemished to God, cleanse our 
conscience from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve
the living God...(Heb. 9:13, 14) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

When the people sacrificed animals, God considered the people's faith 
and obedience, cleansed them from sin, and made them ceremonially
acceptable according to the Old Testament law...

But Christ's sacrifice transforms our life and heart and makes us clean on 
the inside. His sacrifice was infinitely more effective than animal sacrifices.
No barrier of sin or weakness on our part can stifle His forgiveness...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the cleansing power of 
the blood of Jesus Christ. I thank You for the plan of salvation
that was made available through the death of Your Son Jesus 
Christ. Accept my plea for the forgiveness of my many sins...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
