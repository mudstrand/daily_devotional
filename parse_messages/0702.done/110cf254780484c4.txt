GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~No one is in charge of your happiness except you...

Our Meditation for Today:

We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure.
It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,

where Jesus, who went before us, has entered on our behalf.
He has become a high priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek...(Heb. 6:19, 20) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

A curtain hung across the entrance from the Holy Place to the
Most Holy Place, the two innermost rooms of the Temple...

This curtain prevented anyone from entering, gazing into, or even
getting a fleeting glimpse of the interior of the Most Holy Place...

The high priest could enter there only once a year to stand in God's 
presence and atone for the sins of the entire nation...

But Christ is in God's presence at all times, not just once a year, 
as the High Priest who can continually intercede for us...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for that "Old Rugged Cross"
which fulfilled all righteousness, clearing the path to eternal life.
I pray that the preaching of the cross and Christ's redeeming blood
would once again be the main message of every Christian Church...Amen

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
