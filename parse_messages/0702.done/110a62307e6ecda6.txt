GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Everything can change in the blink of an eye.
But don't worry; God never blinks...

Our Meditation for Today:

It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened,
Who have tasted the heavenly gift,
Who have shared in the Holy Spirit,

Who have tasted the goodness of the Word of God
and the powers of the coming age,

If they fall away, to be brought back to repentance.
Because to their loss they are crucifying the Son of God
all over again and subjecting Him to public disgrace......(Heb. 6:4-6) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

These verses point out the danger of the Hebrew Christians'
returning to Judaism and thus committing apostasy...

Some today apply this text to unbelievers who renounce their
Christianity, or to unbelievers who come close to salvation and
then turn away...

Either way, those who reject Christ will not be saved. Christ died 
once for all. He will not be crucified again, Apart from His cross, 
there is no possible way of salvation...

The author of this text is warning against the hardness of the heart
that will make repentance inconceivable for the sinner...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for the gift of eternal life
which is mine by faith in the finished work of Your Son or Lord
Jesus Christ...I pray that the Holy Spirit would be able to soften 
the hearts of those who have not accepted Christ as Savior...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the Prayers of two who care...
