GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Forgive as God forgives you...

Our Meditation for Today:

Because of His oath, Jesus has become the guarantee 
of a better covenant...

Now there have been many of those priests, since death
prevented them from continuing in office;

but because Jesus lives forever, He has a permanent 
priesthood...(Heb. 7:22-24) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Now this "better covenant" is also called the new covenant
or testament. It is new and better because it allows us to go
directly to God through Christ...

We no longer need to rely on sacrificed animals and mediating
priests to obtain God's forgiveness. This new covenant is better 
because, while all human priests die, Christ lives forever...

Priests and sacrifices could not save people, but Christ truly saves.
You have access to Christ. He is available to you, but do you go to 
Him with your needs?

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the assurance of a
better covenant. I thank You that through Your Son our Lord
Jesus Christ, we can come to You at any time and you will 
hear our prayers. I thank You that there is no longer any need 
for a sacrifice... My request today is for good health, healing, 
and grace for each of my e-mail friends...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
