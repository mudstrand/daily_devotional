GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~It's OK to let your children see you cry~~~

Our Meditation for Today: (warning against falling away)

We have much to say about this, but it is hard to explain because
you are slow to learn...

In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need some-
one to teach you the elementary truths of God's Word all over again.
You need milk, not solid food!

Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with 
the teaching about righteousness...(Heb. 5:11-13) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

What Paul was saying here is that these Jewish Christians were immature.
Paul says that by this time they should have been teaching others, but they
had not applied the basics to their own lives...

They were reluctant to move beyond their old traditions, their established
doctrines, and discussions of the basics..

Paul is saying they wouldn't be able to understand the high-priestly role of
Christ unless they moved out of their comfort zone. They would have to cut
some of their Jewish ties, and stop trying to blend in with their culture...

If we are truly committed to Christ He will move us out of our comfort zone...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray for a greater maturity of my faith in You...
Help me to move into a life totally committed to You...
Help me to apply all that I learn so that I may be of greater use to You...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
