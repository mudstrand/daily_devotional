GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Your job won't take care of you when you are sick.
Your friends will. Stay in touch...

Our Meditation for Today:

This is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after
that time, declares the Lord. I will put My laws in their minds
and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they 
will be My people...(Heb. 8:10) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

If our heart is not changed, following God's rules will be unpleasant
and difficult. We will rebel against being told how to live...

The Holy Spirit, however, gives us new desires, helping us want to
obey God (check out Phil. 2:12, 13). With a new heart, we find that
serving God is the greatest joy...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear heavenly Father, my prayer is that more and more 
people would develop loving hearts and come to realize 
the joy of serving You. May they develop a desire to
truly obey Your laws. Bless and protect each of my e-mail
friends today...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
