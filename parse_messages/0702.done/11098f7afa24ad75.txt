Subject: Wet Pants


PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS LITTLE STORY......
WET PANTS
Come with me to a second grade classroom..... There is an 
eight-year-old kid sitting at his desk and all of a

sudden, there is a puddle between his feet and the front of his 
pants are wet. He thinks his heart is

going to stop because he cannot possibly imagine how this has 
happened. It's never happened before, and he

knows that when the boys find out he will never hear the end of 
it. When the girls find out, they'll never

speak to him again as long as he lives.

The boy believes his heart is going to stop; he puts his head 
down and prays this prayer, "Dear God, this

is an emergency! I need help now! Five minutes from now I'm dead 
meat."

He looks up from his prayer and here comes the teacher with a 
look in her eyes that says he has been discovered.

As the teacher is walking toward him, a classmate named Susie is 
carrying a goldfish bowl that is filled

with water. Susie trips in front of the teacher and inexplicably 
dumps the bowl of water in the boy's lap.

The boy pretends to be angry, but all the while is saying to 
himself, "Thank you, Lord! Thank you, Lord!"

Now all of a sudden, instead of being the object of ridicule, 
the boy is the object of sympathy. The

teacher rushes him downstairs and gives him gym shorts to put on 
while his pants dry out. All the other

children are on their hands and knees cleaning up around his 
desk. The sympathy is wonderful. But as

life would have it, the ridicule that should have been his has 
been transferred to someone else - Susie.

She tries to help, but they tell her to get out. You've done 
enough, you klutz!"

Finally, at the end of the day, as they are waiting for the 
bus,
the boy walks over to Susie and whispers,

"You did that on purpose, didn't you?" Susie whispers back, "I 
wet my pants once too."

May God help us see the opportunities that are always around us 
to do good.

Remember.....Just going to church doesn't make you a Christian
any more than standing in your garage makes you a car.

Each and everyone one of us are going through tough times right 
now, but God is getting ready to bless you in a way that only He can. Keep 
the faith.

My instructions were to pick four (4) people that I wanted God 
to bless, and I picked you. Please pass this to at least four (4) people 
you want to be blessed and a copy back to me.

This prayer is powerful, and prayer is one of the best gifts we 
receive. There is no cost but a lot of rewards. Let's continue to pray 
for one another.

The prayer:

Father, I ask You to bless my friends, relatives and those that 
I care deeply for, who are reading this right now. Show them a new 
revelation of Your love and power. Holy Spirit, I ask You to minister to 
their spirit at this very moment. Where there is pain, give them Your 
peace and mercy. Where there is self-doubt, release a renewed confidence 
through Your grace. Where there is need, I ask you to fulfill their needs. 
Bless their homes, families, finances, their goings and their comings. 
Amen.


(If the Lord lays upon your heart to send this to more than 
four "4" people, you are truly blessed).
