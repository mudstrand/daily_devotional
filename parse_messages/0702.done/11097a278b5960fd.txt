THE SECRET

One day, one friend asked another,
"How is it that you are always happy?
You have so much energy,
and you never seem to get down."

With her eyes smiling, she said,
"I know the secret!"
"What secret is that?"
To which she replied,
"I'll tell you all about it, 
but you have to promise to
share the secret with others."

"The secret is this:
I have learned there is little I can do
in my life that will make me truly happy.
I must depend on God to make
me happy and to meet my needs.
When a need arises in my life,
I have to trust God to supply
according to HIS riches.
I have learned most of the time
I don't need half of what I think I do.
He has never let me down.
Since I learned that 'Secret' I am happy."

The questioner's first thought was,
"That's too simple!"
But upon reflecting over his own life
he recalled how he thought a bigger house
would make him happy, but it didn't!
He thought a better paying job
would make him happy, but it hadn't.
When did he realize his greatest happiness?
Sitting on the floor with his grandchildren,
playing games, eating pizza or reading a story, 
a simple gift from God.


Now you know it too!
We can't depend on people to make us happy.
Only GOD in His infinite wisdom can do it.
Trust HIM!
And now I pass the Secret on to you!
So once you get it, what will you do?

You have to tell someone the Secret, too!
That GOD in His wisdom will take care of YOU!
But it's not really a secret...
We just have to believe it and do it...
Really trust God!

BUT!!!

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
