GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Don't compare your life to others. You have no idea 
what their journey is all about...

Our Meditation for Today:

Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not 
acquainted with the teaching about righteousness.

But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have 
trained themselves to distinguish good from evil...(Heb. 5:13, 14) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

In order to become mature Christians we need to learn discernment.
We must train our conscience, our senses, our mind, and our body 
to distinguish good from evil...

Are you able to recognize temptation before it traps you?

Can you tell the difference between a correct use of Scripture and 
a mistaken use?

Our ability understand the deeper knowledge of God, is the determining
factor in our spiritual growth...

To often we want God's banquet before we are spiritually capable of digesting it...

As you grow in the Lord and put into practice what you have learned, your
capacity to understand will also grow...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your Word
I pray that I would continue to grow in wisdom so
that I may truly feast on Your Word...Instill in me a
greater love for You and Your Word...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
