GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~If a relationship has to be secret, you shouldn't be in it...

Our Meditation for Today:

Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ 
and go on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of re-
pentance from acts that lead to death, and of faith in God,

instruction about baptism, the laying on of hands, the res-
urrection of the dead, and eternal judgment...(Heb. 6:1, 2) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Certain basic teachings are essential for all believers to understand.
Those basics include:
The importance of faith, 
The foolishness of trying to be saved by good deeds, 
The meaning of baptism and the spiritual gifts, 
And the facts of the resurrection and eternal life...

To go on to maturity in our understanding, we need to move beyond
(but not away from) the basic teachings to a more complete understanding
of the faith...

Mature Christians should be teaching new Christians the basics. Then,
acting on what they know, the mature will learn even more from God's
Word...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, I thank you for the gift of faith, but I pray for
a greater sensitivity to Your Holy Spirit's teaching so that
I may grow in wisdom enabling me to have a great un-
derstanding of Your will...Bless my e-mail friends with 
good health and safety...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
