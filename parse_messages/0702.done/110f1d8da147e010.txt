GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~However good or bad a situation is, it will change...

Our Meditation for Today:

For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak; 
but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the
Son, who has been made perfect forever...Heb. 7:28) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

As we come to understand the Jewish sacrificial system better,
we will see that Jesus death served as a perfect atonement for
our sins...

His death brings us eternal life. How callous, how cold, how
stubborn it would be to refuse God's greatest gift...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, the words that best explain my feeling for the
wonderful gift of salvation is, "heaven came down and glory
filled my soul---when at the cross the Savior made me whole...
My prayer is that all stubbornness in the world would be left at 
the cross so that every sin would be washed away...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
