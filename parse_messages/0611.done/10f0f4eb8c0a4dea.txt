GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)...Many a good man has failed because he had his
wishbone where his backbone should have been...(see Jos. 1:9)

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, when you were younger you dressed yourself
and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands
and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go."

Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God.
then He said to him, "Follow Me!!!" 

Our Thought for Today:

Of course we already know that this was a prediction of Peter's death by crucifixion.
Tradition indicates that Peter was crucified for his faith, upside down because he 
did not feel worthy of dying as His Lord did...

Despite what Peter's future held, Jesus told him to follow Him...

We may be uncertain and fearful about our future. But if we know God is in control,
we can confidently follow Christ...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that You would always guide and direct me in the 
way You want me go...I thank You for the path You have lead me on in the past...
Lead me in paths of righteousness...I thank You that You are in control, and that 
I can follow Christ in safety...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is there to show you the way...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
