GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...The heart is the happiest when it
beats for others...(see Jn 15:13)

Our Meditation for Today:

Mary had just been speaking to two angels; Then she turned around and saw Jesus
standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus...

"Woman," He said, Why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?" Thinking he 
was the gardener, she said, "Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you have
put Him, and I will get Him."

Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turn toward him and cried out in Aramaic, "Rabboni!"
(which means teacher) (Jn 20:14-16) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Mary didn't recognize Jesus at first. Her grief had blinded her, She couldn't see Him because
she didn't expect to see Him. Then He spoke her name, and immediately she recognized Him...

Can you imagine the love that flooded her heart when she heard her Savior saying her name...

Jesus is near you, and He is calling your name. Can you, like Mary, regard Him as Your Lord?

Our Prayer for Today:

Most Gracious Heavenly Father, Savior of the world, Creator of all that exists,
In the midst of all that is going on in the world deliver Your people. May Your
people recognize Your voice and draw near to You. May this country once again
seek You in all things...Amen.

Keep looking up, He wants to be first in your life...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
