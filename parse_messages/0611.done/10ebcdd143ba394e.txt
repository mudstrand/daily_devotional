GOOD MORNING!!!~~~~~~~(food for thought)~~~To forgive is to set a prisoner free and
discover the prisoner was you. (see Mt 6:14, 15)

Our Meditation for Today:

Later Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph
was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jews. With Pilate's
permission, he came and took the body away...He was accompanied by
Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought 
a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds...(Jn. 19:38, 39) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Four people were changed in the process of Jesus' death:

The criminal, dying on the cross beside Jesus, asked Jesus to include
him in His kingdom (Lk. 23:39-43)

The Roman officer proclaimed that Jesus was surely the Son of God
(Mk. 15:39)

Joseph and Nicodemus, members of the Jewish high council and secret
followers of Jesus (Jn. 7:50-52), came out of hiding.

These men were changed more by Jesus' death than by His life...
they realized who Jesus was, and that realization brought out their
belief, proclamation, and action...

When confronted with Jesus death, we too should be changed~~~
to believe, to proclaim, and to act...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Lord, I thank You for what Your sacrifice on the cross 
means to every believer. I thank You for the change it made 
in my life...Help me each day to remain faithful to You in all
things...Amen.

Keep looking up, all things are possible when we trust in Him...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
