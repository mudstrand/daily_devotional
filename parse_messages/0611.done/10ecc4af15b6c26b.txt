GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...Man cannot discover new oceans unless he has 
the courage to lose sight of the shore. (see Mt. 14:28, 29)

Our Meditation for Today:

Peter and John still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus 
had to rise from the dead. The disciples went back to their homes...
(Jn 20:9, 10) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

The disciples didn't totally understand the significance of all that had happened
until Jesus appeared to them...

Jesus' resurrection is the key to the Christian faith. Why? Because~~~

(1) Just as He said, Jesus rose from the dead. We can now be confident that 
He will accomplish all He has promised...

(2) Jesus' bodily resurrection shows us that the living Christ, not a false prophet or
imposter, is the ruler of God's eternal Kingdom...

(3) We can be certain of our own resurrection because Jesus was resurrected.
Death is not the end, there is a future life.

(4) The divine power that brought Jesus back to life is now available to us to bring
our spiritually dead selves back to life...

(5) The Resurrection is the basis for the church's witness to the world...

When someone comes to you looking for some comforting words in regards to there
life after death, first share that Jesus died for the sins of the whole world and it is available 
to all who believe in His finished work one the cross. Then share the five points above...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the sacrifice you made for me on the cross.
I thank you for the home you have prepared for me in paradise with you.
Forgive me for my sins of thought word and deed. Cleanse my heart of all
unrighteousness...Amen.

Keep looking up, He knows what is best for you...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather...
