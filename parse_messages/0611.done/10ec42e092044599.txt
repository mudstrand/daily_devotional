GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)~~~~To many parents are not on spanking
terms with their children. (see Pro. 13:24)

Our Meditation for Today:

Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the
tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance...

So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved,
and said, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they
have put Him!"

So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb...

Both were running, but the other disciple out ran Peter and reached the tomb first...

He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but didn't go in...

Then Simon Peter, who was behind him, arrived and went into the tomb, he saw
the strips of linen lying there, as well as the burial cloth that had been around Jesus' head.
The cloth was folded up by itself, separate from the linen...

Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw
and believed...(Jn 20:1-8) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

John the most fleet of foot reached the tomb first, and so he bent over and looked in,
but he did not, or could not cross the threshold...

Some people who hear about the Resurrection for the first time often need time to
comprehend the amazing story...

often due to our daily walking in the world we become accustomed to seeing before
believing...But sooner or latter we have to come to have faith, because we are going 
to have to believe in certain things even though they are yet unseen...

So the question that stands before us today is, "Do you have faith?"

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Lord, who art the Creator and Master of everything, create in me
true and lasting faith. Create in me a sensitivity to Your Holy Spirit's 
leading...Amen.

Keep looking up, He wants to lead you...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
