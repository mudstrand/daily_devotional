GOOD MORNING!!!~~~~(food for thought)~~~One thing you can learn by watching the clock is
that it passes time by keeping its hands busy. (see Pro. 18:9)

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus said, "Do not hold on to Me, for I have not yet returned to the Father.
Go instead to My brothers and tell them, 'I am returning to my Father and your
Father, to MY God and your God...

Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: "I have seen the Lord!"
And she told them that He had said these things to her. (Jn. 20:17, 18) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Mary Magdalene did not meet the risen Christ until she had discovered the empty
tomb. She responded with joy and obedience by going to tell the disciples...

We too cannot meet Christ until we discover that He is indeed alive, that His tomb
is indeed empty...

So the ultimate question is, are you filled with joy by this good news, and do you
share it with others...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to always look upon this good news with joy.
So often we Christians are accused of having horse faces, when we should 
have joy in our hearts. Help me to remember that as a Christian my life is being
closely watched by those who can be very critical...I pray that my life would be a
witness for You...Amen.

Keep looking up, If God has brought you to it, He will bring you though it...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
