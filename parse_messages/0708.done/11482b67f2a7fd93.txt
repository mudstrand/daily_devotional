GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~God's righteous wrath and judgement are terminated for those who believe.

Our Meditation for Today:

Since we have now been justified by His blood, 
how much more shall we be saved from God's 
wrath through Him!

For if, when we were God's enemies, we were 
reconciled to Him through the death of His Son,
how much more, having been reconciled, shall 
we be saved through His life! (Ro. 5:9, 10) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Here is some real thoughts: The love that caused Christ 
to die is the same love that sends His Holy Spirit to live in 
us and guide us every day...AND

The same power that raises Christ from the dead is the same
power that saved us and is available to us in our daily life...ALSO

Be assured of this that, having begun a life with Christ, you have 
a reserve of power and love to call on each day for help to meet
every challenge or trial...

All you need to do is pray for God's power and love as you need it...........

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the assurance 
that all that I need to do is call on You for Your love
and sustaining power for each day...I pray that in my
struggles I will remember that You are always there
to answer my request for the day...Lord I pray for the
safety of our nation, it's citizens, and our troops. I also
ask for Your hand of protection over those who are in 
the path of Hurricane Dean...

Keep looking up, His power will sustain you...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
