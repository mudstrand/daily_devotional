GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Think of it...God beholds us only as we are in Christ...

Our Meditation for Today:

Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because
we know that suffering produces perseverance;

Perseverance, character; and character, hope...(Ro. 5:3, 4) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

For first century Christians, suffering was the rule rather than
the exception. Paul tells us that we will experience difficulties
but they will help us grow...

We can rejoice in suffering, not because we like pain or deny
its tragedy, but because we know God is using life's difficulties
and Satan's attacks to build our character...

The problems that we run into will develop our perseverance, which
in turn will strengthen our character, deepen our trust in God, and
give us greater confidence about the future...

You probably find your patience tested in some way every day. 
Thank God for those opportunities to grow, and deal with them 
in His strength...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that you would give me the strength
and the patience to deal with each trial that comes onto my life...
Help me to become more Christ-like with each trial that comes my
way...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is waiting to give you a helping hand...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather...
