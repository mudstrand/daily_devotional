GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Baptism unites and identifies the believer with Christ
both in His death and resurrection..

Our Meditation for Today:

If we have been united with Him like this in His death, we will certainly
also be united with Him in His resurrection...(Ro. 6:5) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Because we are united with Christ in His death, our evil desires
and bondage to sin died with Him...

Now united by faith with Him in His resurrection life, we have an unbroken
fellowship with God and freedom from sin's hold on us...

For more information on the difference between our new life in Christ
and our old sinful nature read Ephesians 4:21-24 and Colossians
3:3-15...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear heavenly Father, forgive me of my sins again today I pray.
Help me to understand more clearly Your way unto righteousness.
Bless my e-mail friends with strength and good health...Amen.

Keep looking up toward Jesus our priceless treasure...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
