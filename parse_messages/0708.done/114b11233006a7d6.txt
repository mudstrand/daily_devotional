GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~We are to follow the crucified one...

Our Meditation for Today:

Don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus
were baptized into His death?

We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death
in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through
the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life...(Ro. 6:3:4) NIV

Our Thoughts for Today:

In the church of Paul's day, immersion (in other words, a complete dunking)
was the usual form of baptism. New Christian were completely submersed
in water...

They understood baptism to symbolize the death and burial of the old way
of life...

Coming up out of the water symbolized resurrection to new life in Christ...

If we think of our old, sinful life as dead and buried, we have a powerful 
motive to resist sin...

We can consciously choose to treat the desires and temptations of the 
old nature as if they were dead. Then we can continue to enjoy our wonderful
new life with Jesus...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the "New Life"
that is mine through what You did for me on the cross.
I thank You also that I can look upon my old life as dead,
but alive in You...I thank You for Your mercy and grace...Amen.

Keep looking up, He does all thing well...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
