Body (clean, unformatted):
===================================================================
GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Do not sit as judge over what God has said,
but rather sit and listen to what He says...

Our Meditation for Today:

Without weakening in his faith, Abraham faced the fact
that his body was as good as dead, since he was about 
a hundred years old, and that his wife Sarah's womb was
also dead...

Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise 
of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,

being fully persuaded that God had power to do what He had 
promised...(Ro. 4:19-21)

Our Thought for Today:

Abraham never doubted that God would fulfil His promise.
Abraham's life was marked by mistakes, sins,and failures
as well as by wisdom and goodness, but he constantly
trusted God...

His faith was strengthened by the obstacles he faced, and 
his life was an example of faith in action...

IF he had looked only at his own resources for subduing 
Canaan and founding a nation, he would have given up in
despair. But Abraham looked to God, obeyed Him, and 
waited for God to fulfil His word...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for my mistakes, sins, and
failures. Give me patience to wait on Your timing in situation
I can do nothing about...Thank You for having patience with me...Amen.

Keep looking up, God promises a safe 
landing not a calm passage...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
