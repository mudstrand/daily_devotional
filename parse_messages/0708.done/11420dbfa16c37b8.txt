GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~One is justified by faith apart from the law...

Our Meditation for Today:

We maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from observing
the law... Is God the God of the Jews only? Is He not the God of
Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles to, since there is only one God,
who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised
through that same faith... Do we, then, nullify the law by this
faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law...(Ro. 3:28-31) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

A question that is often asked is, "Why does God save us by faith alone?"

First of all: Faith eliminates the pride of human effort, because faith is not 
a deed that we do.

Second: Faith exalts what God has done, not what we do...

Third: Faith admits that we can't keep the law or measure up to God's
standards, we need help...

Fourth: Faith is based on our relationship with God, not our performance for God...

Faith does not wipe out the Old T.. Rather, it makes God's dealings with the Jewish
people understandable...(See Gal 3:24-29 and I Tim. 1:8 for mor on this concept.)

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the gift of faith, for I know
that by my own efforts I am nothing...I pray for a greater amount
of faith so that my thoughts would be inline with Your thoughts...Amen.

Keep looking up, in faithfulness...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
