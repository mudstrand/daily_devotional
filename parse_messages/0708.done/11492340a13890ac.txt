GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Let us remember, there is no satisfaction except in the Son
of God, and all our righteousness is in Him...

Our Meditation for Today:

Before the Law was given, sin was in the world. But sin
is not taken into account when there is no law...

Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the 
time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking
a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to 
come...(Ro 5:13, 14) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Paul was shown that keeping the law does not bring salvation.
Here he adds that breaking the law is not what brings death.

Death is the result of Adam's sin and the sins we all commit, even
if they do not resemble Adam's sin...

Paul reminds us that for thousands of years the law had not been
explicitly given and yet people died. The law was added, he explains
in 5:20 to help people see their sinfulness, to show them the seriousness 
of their offenses, and drive them to God for mercy and pardon...

This was true in Moses' day, and still is today.
The law shows who we are and what we were created to be...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the law for it 
shows me my need for redemption. So I ask again 
today, forgive me for my sins of though, word and 
deed...Keep our nation, its citizens, and our troops
safe. I pray that peace would come to the world...Amen.

Keep looking up, He wants to fulfil your needs...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
