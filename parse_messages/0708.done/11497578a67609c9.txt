Body (clean, unformatted):

GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~You are not your own; you were bought with a price.
So glorify God in your body....

Our Meditation for Today:

But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by 
the trespass of one-man, how much more did God's grace
and the gift that came by grace of one man Jesus Christ,
overflow to many!!!

Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's 
sin: The judgement followed one sin and brought condemnation,
but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification...
(Ro. 5:15, 16) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

We were all born into Adam's physical family, the family line
that leads to certain death. All of us have reaped the results 
of Adam's sin.

We have inherited his guilt, a sinful nature (the tendency to sin), 
and God's punishment...

Because of Jesus, we can trade judgment for forgiveness. Christ
offers us the opportunity to be born into His spiritual family, the
family line that begins with forgiveness and leads to eternal life.

If we do nothing, we receive death through Adam; but if we come 
to God by faith, we receive life through Christ...

To which family line do you belong???

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I have so much to be thankful for,
but at the same time I have so much need of Your divine
forgiveness. I have sinned against You in thought, word, 
and deed, forgive me Lord of these I pray. I pray for good 
health and safety for my circle of e-mail friends...Amen.

Keep looking up, He loves you and has got you in His hands...
You're in the prayers of two care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
