GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~We possess peace with God only if we are justified by faith

Our Meditation for Today:

Through Jesus Christ we have gain access by faith into
His grace in which we now stand. and we rejoice in the 
hope of the glory of God...(Ro. 5:2) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Paul states that as believers, we now stand in a place of
high privilege. Not only has God declared us not guilty, 
He has drawn us close to Himself...

Instead of being enemies, we have become His friends.
In fact, His own children, as we see by Jn. 15:15; Gal. 4:5.

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for this day, 
a day that You have made, a time to rejoice and
be glad for it. I pray that You would forgive me for
all the times I have complained, when I should
have been thankful...Amen.

Keep looking up, for a better way to serve...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather...
