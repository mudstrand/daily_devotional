GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Our intentions must be against sin, and to live 
victorious over the wiles of the tempter...

Our Meditation for Today:

What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that 
grace may increase?

By no means! We died to sin; how can we live in it any
longer...(Ro. 6:1, 2) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

If God loves to forgive, why not give Him more to forgive?
If forgiveness is guaranteed, do we have the freedom to
sin as much as we want to?

Paul's forceful answer is "Of course not! Such an attitude--
deciding ahead of time to take advantage of God, shows 
that a person does not understand the seriousness of sin.

God's forgiveness does not make sin less serious, His Son's
death for sin shows us the dreadful seriousness of sin...

Jesus paid with His life so that we could be forgive. The 
availability of God's mercy must not become an excuse for
careless living and moral laziness...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I come before You again, 
seeking forgiveness for my sins. Yes Lord I do 
realize the seriousness of sin. And I thank You for 
Your Son's willingness to die for my sins. I pray for 
the safety of our nation, its citizens, and our troops...Amen.

Keep looking up, we have a merciful God...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
