>Here is something you car buffs probably didn't know.
> The 3 Goldberg
brothers, Norman, Hiram, and Maxwell invented and developed the first
automobile air-conditioner. Didn't know that, did ya... On July 17th, 1946,
the temperature in Detroit was 97
> The 3 brothers walked into old man
Henry Ford's office and . sweet- talked his secretary into telling him
that 3 gentlemen were there with the most exciting innovation in the auto
industry since the electric starter. Henry was curious and invited them
into his office.They refused and instead asked that he come out to the
parking lot to their car.They persuaded him to get into the car which was
about 130- turned on the air-conditioner and cooled the car off
immediately.The old man got very excited and invited them back to the
office, where he offered them 3 million dollars for the patent.The brothers
refused, saying they would settle for 2
>million but they wanted the
recognition by having a label "The Goldberg Air-Conditioner" on the
dashboard of each car that it was installed in. Now old man Ford was more
than just a little bit
>Anti-Semitic, and there was no way he was going to
put the Goldbergs'
>name on 2 million Ford cars.They haggled back and forth
for about 2 hours and finally agreed on 4 million dollars and that just
their first names would be shown.And so, even today,all Ford
air-conditioners show on the controls the names "Norm, Hi, & Max".

There, now ya know it....
