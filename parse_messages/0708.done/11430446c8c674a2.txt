GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~I will be gone until Thursday so there will not be any devos.

Our Meditation for Today:

David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness
of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:

"Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins
are covered...

Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count against him.
(Ro. 4:6-8) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

What can we do to get rid of guilt? King David was guilty of terrible
sins--adultery, murder, lying--and yet he experienced the joy of forgiveness.

We, too, can have this joy when we:
(1) Quit denying our guilt and recognize that we have sinned,
(2) Admit our guilt to God and ask for His forgiveness, and
(3) Let go of our quilt and believe that God has forgiven us...

This can be difficult when a sin has taken root in our life over 
many years, when it is very serious, or when it involves others...

We must remember that Jesus is willing and able to forgive 
every sin. When we remember the tremendous price He paid 
on the cross, it is arrogant to think that there is any sin too great
for Him to forgive...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that You would forgive
each and every sin I have committed. I do believe
that You paid the debt in full on the cross for my sins...Amen

Keep looking up, He is the way of salvation...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
