11/10/2010~~~food for thought~~~LET US COME BOLDLY WITH CONFIDENCE

Bible Verse for Today:
16 Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence, 
so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need. 

Our Lesson for Today:
The Question is: "What is our approach to the throne of grace?"
The only way is by "prayer". . . How? Boldly and with confidence.

Some Christians approach God meekly with heads hung low, afraid 
to ask Him to meet their needs. . .

Others pray flippantly giving little thought to what they say. . .

What one must do is come with reverence because He is your King.
But also come with bold assurance because He is your Friend and Counselor. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, A pray that Your Spirit will teach me to pray
with boldness and assurance. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the 
Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
