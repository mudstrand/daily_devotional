11/28/2010~~~food for thought~~~ALLOWING CHRIST TO RULE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Let the message of Christ dwell (rule) among you richly as you teach 
and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, 
and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.
(Col. 3:16) 

Our Lesson for Today:
Christians should live in peace. ~ However to live in peace does not mean
that suddenly all differences of opinion are eliminated, but it does require that 
loving Christians work together despite their differences. . .

Such love is not a feeling but a decision to meet others' needs (see I Cor. 13).
To live in love leads to peace between individuals and among the members of 
the body of believers. . .

Do problems in your relationship with other Christians cause open conflicts or 
mutual silence? ~ Consider what you can do to heal those relationships with love. . .

Whatever you do or say, let it be as a representative of the Lord Jesus. Let it 
bring honor to Christ in every aspect and activity of daily living. . .

Remember as a Christian, you represent Christ at all times, wherever you go
or whatever you say. What impression do people have of Christ when they 
see or talk with you? What changes would you make in your life in order to
honor Chat? ? ?

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, forgive me for the areas in my life
that are unpleasing to You, and help me to correct
those problems. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
