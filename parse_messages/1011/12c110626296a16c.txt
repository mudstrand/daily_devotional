11/03/2010~~~food for thought~~~A BONDSERVANT OF JESUS

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live,
but Christ lives in me. . ." (Gal. 2:20)

Our Lesson for Today:
These words mean the breaking and collapse of our own independence
brought about by our own hands, as well as the surrender of our life to the
supremacy of our Lord Jesus Christ. . .

No one can do this for us, we must do it for ourselves. God may bring us 
up to this point 365 times a year, but He cannot (will not) push us through it.

It means breaking the hard outer layer of our individual independence from 
God, and the liberating of ourselves and our nature into oneness with Him; not 
following our own ideas, but choosing absolute loyalty to Jesus. . .

The passion of Christianity comes from deliberately signing away our own rights
and becoming a bondservant to Christ. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, soften my heart so that I would
become obedient to You. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
