11?02/2010~~~food for thought~~~OBEDIENCE OR INDEPENDENCE?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"If you love me, keep My commandments" (Jn. 14:15).

Our Lesson for Today:
The Lord does not give me rules, but He makes His standard very clear.
If my relationship with Him is that of love, I will do what He says without
hesitation. If I hesitate, it is because I love someone I have placed in
competition with Him, namely, myself. . .

Jesus Christ will not force me to obey Him but I must. And as soon as 
I obey Him, I fulfill my spiritual destiny. My personal life may be crowded 
with small, petty happenings, altogether insignificant. . . 

But if I obey Jesus Christ in the seemingly random circumstances of life, 
they become pinholes through which I see the face of God. Then, when I
stand face to face with God, I will discover that through my obedience
thousands were blessed. . .

When God's redemption brings a human soul to the point of obedience,
it always produces. ~ If I obey Jesus Christ, the redemption of God will flow 
through me to the lives of others, because behind the deed of obedience 
is the reality of Almighty God. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, forgive me for not living up to Your
standards as I should. . .Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
