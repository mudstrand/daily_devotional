11/26/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE FOCAL POINT OF OUR FAITH

Our Bible Verse for Today:
As for me, God forbid that I should boast about anything 
except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ...(Gal 6:14)

Our Lesson for Today:
The world is full of enticements. Every day we are confronted with subtle 
cultural pressures. And it certainly does not help if we are addicted to the TV. . .

The only way to escape these destructive influences is to ask God to
help crucify our interests in them, just as Paul did. Just how much do the
interests of this world matter to you? ? ?

For more on this concept read Gal. 2:20; and 5:24 (time well spent)

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I pray that You would help me escape
the influences of this world, so that I would not have
anything to boast in but the cross of Jesus Christ. . . Amen. 
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
