Our Bible Verse for Today:
We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the spirit Himself intercedes
for us with groaning that words cannot express. . .(Ro. 8:26)

Our Lesson for Today:
As a believer we need to learn that we are not left to our own resources
to cope with the problems of life. (Thank God!) Even when we do not know 
the right words to pray, the Holy Spirit prays with and for us, and God answers. 

With God's Spirit helping us pray, we need not be afraid to come before Him.
Merely ask the Holy Spirit to intercede for you "in harmony with God's own will."
Then when you bring your requests before God trust that He will always 
do what is best. . .

Suggested Prayer:
Dear Lord, help me to listen to Your Spirit's voice as I
come to You in prayer. Help me to be willing to trust that
You always know what is best. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
