11/29/2010~~~food for thought~~~LET THE WORD OF GOD BE KNOWN

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Give praise to the LORD, proclaim his name; make known 
among the nations what He has done." - 1 Chronicles 16:8 

Our Lesson for Today:
I think we need to look at a bit of O. T. history, which will help us 
to appreciate this verse more. . .

We need to remember that God chose Israel to be a blessing to the whole
world (Gen. 12:1-3). This blessing found its fulfillment in Jesus a descendent
of Abraham and David (Gal. 3:8, 9) ~ WHO became the Messiah for all people,
Jews and non-Jews. . .

We also need to remember that when the Israelites first entered the Promise Land,
they were ordered to clear out several wicked nations, and so we read in the O. T. 
of many wars. Now in this we should never conclude that was Israel's first duty.

After subduing the evil people Israel was to become a light to the surrounding nations.
Sadly, Israel's own sin and spiritual blindness perverted them from reaching out to
the rest of the world with God's love.

So Jesus came to do what the nation of Israel failed to do, so let us "give thanks to the 
Lord and proclaim His greatness."

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, we know that you have called every believer
to proclaim Your name to all people. Forgive us Lord
for falling short of upholding this call. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John:
