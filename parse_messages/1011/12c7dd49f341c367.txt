11/24/1010~~~food for thought~~~GRATITUDE OR INGRATITUDE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
I lift up my eyes to the hills ~ where does my help come from?
My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth. . .(Ps. 121:1, 2)

Our Lesson for Today:
Going to God's house can be a chore or a delight. For the psalmist, 
it was a delight. As a pilgrim attending one of the three great religious
festivals, he rejoiced to worship with God's people in God's house...

It is very easy for us to find worship a chore IF we have unconfused
sin or if our love for God has cooled. ~But if we are close to God
and enjoy His presence, we will be eager to worship and praise Him. . .

Our attitude toward God will determine our view of worship. . .
Let us once again approach Him with an attitude of gratitude! ! !

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to always seek You with an attitude of 
thanksgiving, for what you have done for me. . .Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
