The greatest responsibility God gives parents is\n\nthe nurture and guidance of their children. The lack of discip-\n\nline puts parent’s love in question because it shows a lack\n\nof concern for the character development of their child-\n\nren. Disciplining children averts long-range disaster. With-\n\nout correction children, grow up with no clear understanding\n\nof right and wrong, and with no direction to their lives. Don’t\n\nbe afraid to discipline your children. It is an act of love.\n\nRemember, however, that your efforts can not make\n\nyour children wise, they can only encourage your children to\n\nseek God’s wisdom.\n\n*Pastor Sather*\n\n*Dear Heavenly Father, help us to remember to pray that our children\nhave l**ooked\nto you for Your wisdom. **Amen.*\n",
