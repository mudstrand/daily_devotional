10/19/2010~~~food for thought~~~SEEKING FIRST HIS KINGDOM

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Jesus answered, "My Kingdom is not of this world." (Jn 18:36)

Our Lesson for Today:
I have said it before and I'll say it again ~ We must get rid of the plague of the 
spirit of this religious age in which we live. . .

In our Lord's life here on earth there was none of the pressures and the rushing
of tremendous activity that we regard so highly today, and a disciple (believer)
is to be like his Master. . . 

The central point of the kingdom of Jesus Christ is a personal relationship with 
Him, not public usefulness to others. . .

We need to spend more time submersing ourselves in His Word so that we
become rooted and grounded in Him, then we will remain true to Him what ever
happens. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, Help me to put aside the business of the things 
of this world, so that I can spend more time becoming rooted
and ground in You. . .Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
