10/13/2010~~~food for thought~~~A TIME FOR PERSONAL GROWTH

Our Bible Verse for Today:
". . .When Moses was grown. . . he went out to his brethren and
looked at their burdens" (Ex. 2:11).

Our Lesson for Today:
We may have a clear vision of what God wants of us, and yet when 
we start to do it, there comes to us something equivalent to Moses'
forty years in the wilderness. . .

It's as if God had ignored the entire thing, and when we are thoroughly
discouraged, God comes back and revives His call to us. And then
we like Moses begin to tremble and say, "Who am I that I should go."

We must learn that God's great stride is drummed up in these words,
"I AM WHO I AM. . .has sent me to you" (Ex. 3:14). We must also learn
that our individual effort for God shows nothing but disrespect for Him,
our individuality is to be rendered radiant through a personal relationship
with God so that He may be "well pleased" (Mt. 3:17).

Remember ~ if you are going through a time of discouragement, there is
a time of great personal growth ahead. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, Help me to remain patient, while a personal
growth is taking place in me. . .Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
