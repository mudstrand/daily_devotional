10/28/2010~~~food for thought~~~JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH

Our Bible Verse for Today:
If when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the 
death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall 
be saved by His life. . . (Ro. 5:10)

Our Lesson for Today:
I am not saved by believing ~ 
I simply realize I am saved by believing.

And it is not repentance that saves me ~ 
repentance is only the sign that I realize what God has done through Christ Jesus.

The danger here is: putting the emphasis on the effect, instead of on the cause.
Is it: my obedience, consecration, and dedication that make me right with God?
It is never that! I am made right with God because, prior to all of that, Christ died.

When I turn to God and by belief accept what God reveals, the miraculous atonement 
by the cross of Christ instantly places me into a right relationship with God. . .

And as a result, of the supernatural miracle of God's grace I stand justified, not
because I'm sorry for my sins, or because I have repented, but because of what 
Jesus has done.

The Spirit of God brings justification with a shattering, radiant light, and I know that 
I am saved, even though I don't know fully how it was accomplished. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I thank You for the miracle of salvation
through Jesus Christ's death on the cross. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
