10/03/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE PLACE OF MINISTRY

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"He said to them, 'This kind [of unclean spirit] can come out by
nothing but prayer' " (Mk. 9:29)

Our Lesson for Today:
The disciples would often face difficult situations that could only be resolved
through prayer. . . Prayer is the key that unlocks faith in our life. ~

Effective prayer needs both an attitude, complete dependence, and an action,
asking. . .

Prayer demonstrates our reliance on God as we humbly invite Him to fill us with
faith and power. ~ There is no substitute for prayer, especially in circumstances
that seem impossible. . .

In what are you depending upon today?

"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." (Phil. 4:13)

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I pray for a Christ-like attitude so my
prayers will be in accordance with Your will. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
