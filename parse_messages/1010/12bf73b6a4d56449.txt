Our Bible Verse for Today:
"He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become
the righteousness of God in Him." (II Cor. 5:21)

Our Lesson for Today:
The 'modern' view of the death of Jesus is that He died for our sins out
of sympathy for us. But the New Testament view is that He took our sin
on Himself not because of sympathy, but, because of His identification
with us. . .

He was "made. . .to be sin. . ." Our sins are removed because of the
death of Jesus, and the only explanation for His death is His obedience
to His Father, not His sympathy for us. . .

We are acceptable to God not because we have obeyed, nor because 
we have promised to give up things, but because of the death of Christ,
and for no other reason. . .

We say that Jesus came to reveal the fatherhood and the loving kindness 
of God, but the New Testament says He came to "take away sin of the world."
(Jn. 1:29) and the revealing of the Fatherhood of God is only for those whom
Jesus has been introduced as Savior. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I thank you for paying the penalty for
my sins. I pray that Your Spirit may be seen in
my love for others. . . Amen. 
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
