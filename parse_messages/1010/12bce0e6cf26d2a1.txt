Our Bible Verse for Today:
But you, beloved, must continue to build your lives on the foundation 
of your holy faith. And continue to pray as you are directed by the Holy 
Spirit. . ." (Jude 20)

Our Lesson for Today:
In order to pray being led by the Holy Spirit, we need to build up the 
foundation of our faith. . .

To pray as we are (directed by the Holy Spirit) means to pray in the 
power and strength of the Holy Spirit. . .

He prays for us (Ro. 8:26, 27)
He opens our mind to Jesus (Jn. 14:26) And
He teaches us about Him (Jn. 15:26). . .

John warns us to live close to God and His people, not listening to false 
teachers who would try to pull us away from Him (Jn. 15:9, 10).

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, Help me to continue building up my holy faith,
that I may remain faithful, and allow the Holy Spirit to lead 
me in the way of righteousness. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
