Our Bible Verse for Today:
Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant ~
And whoever wants to be first must be your slave. . . (Mt. 20:26, 27)

Our Lesson for Today:
I think you will agree with me, that Jesus describes leadership from a whole new 
perspective. ~ Instead of using people, we are to serve them. . . 

Jesus' mission was to serve others and to give His life away. What Jesus is saying 
is "A real leader has a servant's heart." Servant leaders appreciate others' worth
and realize that they're not above any job. . .

If you see something that needs to be done, don't wait to be asked. . .
Take the initiative and do it like a faithful servant. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, Help me to forget self and always focus 
on the needs of others. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
