10/12/2010~~~food for thought~~~KEEPING IN STEP WITH GOD

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Enoch walked with God. . . " (Gen. 5:24)

Our Lesson for Today:
The true test of a person's spiritual life and character is not what he
does during the extraordinary moments of his life, but what he does
during the ordinary times when there is nothing tremendous or exciting
happening. . .

A person's worth is revealed in his attitude toward the ordinary things 
of life when he is not under the spotlight (see Jn. 1:35-37 and 3:30). . .

Oh it can be painful work to get in step with God and to keep pace
with Him ~ it means getting your second wind spiritually. In learning to
walk with God, there is always the difficulty of getting into His stride,
but once we have done so, the only characteristic that exhibits itself
is the very life of God Himself. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to become merged into a oneness
with You, so that Your stride and Your power alone are
exhibited. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
