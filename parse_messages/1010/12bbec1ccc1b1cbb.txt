10/18/2010~~~food for thought~~~THEY KEY TO CHRISTIAN DEVOTION

Our Bible Verse for Today:
". . . they went forth for His name sake. . ." (3 Jn. 1:7)

Our Lesson for Today:
'Faithfulness' to Jesus Christ is the supernatural work of redemption that
has been performed in us by the Holy Spirit ~ "The love of God has been
poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. . ." (Ro. 5:5)

It is that love in us that effectively works through us which in turn shows itself
to everyone we come in contact with. . .

The duty of His faithful followers is to concentrate on keeping his/her soul
completely and continually open to the nature of our Lord Jesus Christ. . .

Those who our Lord sends out on 'His' endeavors are ordinary human people,
but people who are controlled by their devotion to Him, which has been brought 
about through the work of the Holy Spirit. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I am definitely an ordinary human being,
help me to be a more devoted follower. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
