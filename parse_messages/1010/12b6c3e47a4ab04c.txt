10/02/2010~~~food for thought~~~A PLACE OF HUMILIATION

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"If You can do anything, have compassion on us 
and help us" (Mk. 9:22)

Our Lesson for Today:
"If You can do anything. . ." Why does it seem to take a valley of humiliation to
remove the skepticism from us? Look back at your own experiences and I think
you will find that until you learned who Jesus really was, you were a skillful skeptic
about His power. . .

When you were on the mountaintop you could believe anything, but what about 
when you were faced with the facts of the valley?

You may be able to give a testimony regarding your sanctification, but what about
the thing that is a humiliation to you right now? 

The last time you were on the mountain with God, you saw that all the power in heaven 
and on earth belonged to Jesus ~ will you be skeptical now, simply because you are 
in the valley of humiliation?

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I believe, help my unbelief. . .Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to The father except through me." - John: 14:6
