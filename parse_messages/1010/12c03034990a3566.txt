10/31/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE TRIAL OF FAITH

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"if you have faith as a mustard seed. . .nothing will be
impossible for you." (Mt. 17:20)

Our Lesson for Today:
"Faith" is the key, but not in ourselves but in the power of God.
Jesus said that even faith as small or undeveloped as a mustard 
seed will be sufficient. . .

Could it have been that the disciples had tried to cast out the
demon with their own ability rather than God's? There is great 
power in even a little faith when we trust in God's power to act. 

If we feel weak or powerless as Christians, we should examine
our faith, making sure we are trusting God's power, not in our own
ability to produce results. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to make a honest examination 
of my faith. Give me just enough faith to always trust
in Your Power. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
