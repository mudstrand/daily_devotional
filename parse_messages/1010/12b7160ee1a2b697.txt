Deborah Sather - Mom to some of you, Grandma to some of you; Great Grandma, Auntie, Friend, etc to some -

Anyway she will have a birthday on October 17 (birth year 17; is that something like a golden birthday?)

We will have a party for her on Saturday October 16. Open house 2-5 at Elderbush Family Room. 

No gifts, please, but cards and your company would be great.

Hope to see you there.

Can't make it but want to send a card? Here's her address:

Deborah Sather, 610 Central Ave, W, Greenbush, MN 56726

Please forward this message to all family or others who would be interested. I don't have contact information for everyone.

If you forward this to 10 people you will -- -- I don't know, get rich, get blessed, get three wishes?
