11/1/2010~~~food for thought~~~"YOU ARE NOT YOUR OWN"

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Do you not know that . . . you are not your own?" (I Cor. 6:19)

Our Lesson for Today:
There is no such thing as a private life, ~ or ~ a place to hide in this world, 
for a man or woman who is intimately aware of ~ and~ shares in the suffering
of Jesus Christ. . .

God divides the private life of His saints and makes it a highway for the world on 
one hand and for Himself on the other. ~ No ~ human being can stand unless He 
is identified with Jesus Christ. . .

We are not sanctified for ourselves. ~ We are called ~ into intimacy with the gospel, 
and things happen that appear to have nothing to do with us. ~ But~ God is getting 
us into fellowship with Himself. ~ Let Him have His way. ~ If ~ you refuse, you will
be of no value to God in His redemptive work in the world, ~ but ~ will be a
hindrance and a stumbling block. . .

Prayer Suggestion: 
Dear Lord, help me to grow in faith that I may
have a more intimate relationship with You. . . Amen. 
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
