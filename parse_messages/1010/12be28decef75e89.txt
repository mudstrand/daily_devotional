10/25/2010~~~food for thought~~~SUBMITTING TO GOD'S PURPOSE
Our Bible Verse for Today:

"I have become all things to all men, that I might
by all means save some." (I Cor. 9:22)

Our Lesson for Today:
A Christian worker has to learn how to be God's man or woman
of great worth and excellence in the midst of a multitude of meager
and worthless things. . .

We should never protest by saying, "If only were somewhere else!"
All of God's people are ordinary people who have been made extraordinary
by the purpose He has given them. Unless we have the right purpose 
intellectually in our minds and lovingly in our hearts, we will very quickly
be diverted from being useful to God. . .

We are not workers for God by choice. Many people deliberately choose 
to be workers, but they have no purpose of God's almighty grace or His 
mighty Word in them. Paul's whole heart, mind, and soul were consumed 
with the great purpose of what Jesus Christ came to do, and he never lost
sight of that one thing. . .

W must continually confront ourselves with one central fact ~ 
". . .Jesus Christ and Him crucified." (I Cor. 2:2)

Never choose to be a worker, but once God has placed His call upon you,
woe be to you if you "turn aside. . . to the right or the left. . . " (Deut. 28:14)
He will do with you what He never did before His call came to you, and He
will do with you what He is not doing with other people. Let Him have His way.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help to find my way,
so that I might be found faithful in Your eyes. . .Amen. 
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
