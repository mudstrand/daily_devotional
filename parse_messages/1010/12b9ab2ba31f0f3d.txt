10/11/2010~~~food for thought~~~GOD'S SILENCE ~ THEM WHAT?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"When He heard that he, (Lazarus) was sick, He (Jesus) stayed two more days
in the place where He was." (Jn. 11:6)

Our Lesson for Today:
Has God trusted you with His silence, a silence that has great meaning?
God's silences are actually His answers. . .

Just think of those days of absolute silence in the home at Bethany!
Is there anything comparable to those days in your life? ~ Can God
trust you like that, or are you still asking Him for a visible answer?

God will give you the very blessings you ask if you refuse to go any 
further without them, but His silence is the sign that He is bringing you
into an even more wonderful understanding of Himself. . .

When you cannot hear God, you will find that He has trusted you in the most
intimate way possible ~ with absolute silence, not a silence of despair, but 
one of pleasure, because He saw that you could withstand an even bigger
revelation. . .

If God has given you a silence, then praise Him ~ He is bring you into the
mainstream of His purpose. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to be patient in the time
of silence. Help me to accept Your silence
with faith. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
