10/22/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE WITNESS OF THE SPIRIT

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"The Spirit Himself bears witness with our Spirit. . ." (Ro. 8:16)

Our Lesson for Today:
The Spirit of God witnesses to the redemption of our Lord, and nothing else.
He cannot witness to our reason. WHY? ? ?

Because we are inclined to mistake the simplicity that comes from our natural 
commonsense decisions for the witness of the Spirit, but the Spirit witnesses 
only to His own nature, and to the work of redemption, never to our reason. . .

If we are trying to make Him witness to our reason, it is no wonder that we are 
in darkness and uncertainty. ~ Throw it all over board, trust in Him, and He will 
give you the witness of the Spirit. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I thank You for Your Spirit's presence, 
and guidance to witness in accordance with Your
will. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
