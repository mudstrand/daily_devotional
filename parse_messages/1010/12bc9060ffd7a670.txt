10/20/2010~~~food for thought~~~IS GOD'S WILL MY WILL ?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"This is the will of God, your sanctification. . ." (I Thess. 4:3)

Our Lesson for Today:
Sanctification is not a question of whether God is willing to sanctify me ~ 
is it my will? Am I willing to let God do in me everything that has been made
possible through the atonement of the Cross of Christ?

Am I willing to let Jesus become sanctification to me, and to let His life be
exhibited in my human flesh? (see I Cor. 1:30)

Beware of saying, "Oh, I am longing to be sanctified. "No your not!"
Recognize your need, but stop longing and make it a matter of action.

Receive Jesus Christ to become sanctification for you by absolute,
unquestioning faith, and the great miracle of the atonement of Jesus
will become real to you. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, effect in me an obedient heart toward service and prayer,
also created in me an inexpressible thanks and adoration for the gift
of eternal life. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to The Father except through me." - John: 14:6
