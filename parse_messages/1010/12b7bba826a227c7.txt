10/05/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE NATURE OF DEGENERATION

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin,
and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned. . ." (Ro. 5:12)

Our Lesson for Today:
The question often asked is, "How can we be declared guilty for something
Adam did thousands of years ago?" ~ ~ ~ Yes many feel it isn't fair for God
to judge us because of Adam's sin. . .

Yet each of us confirms our heritage with Adam by our own sins every day.
We have the same sinful nature and are prone to rebel against God, and we
are judged for the sins we commit. . .

Sin is something I am born with and cannot touch ~ only God touches sin through
redemption. It is through the cross of Christ that God redeemed the entire human
race from the possibility of damnation through the heredity of sin. . .

Because we are sinners, it isn't fairness we need ~ It is mercy. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, today, I seek Your mercy to forgive me
of my many sins, known and unknown. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
