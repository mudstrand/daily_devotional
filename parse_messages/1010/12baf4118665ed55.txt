10/15/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE KEY TO OUR MESSAGE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours
only but also for the whole world." (I Jn. 2:2)

Our Lesson for Today:
Sometimes it is difficult to forgive those who wrong us. Imagine 
how hard it would be to forgive everyone ~ the whole world, no 
matter what they had done. This is what God has done in Jesus.

Yes Jesus is the atoning sacrifice for our sins. ~ He can stand before 
God as our mediator because His death satisfied the wrath of God 
against sin and paid the death penalty for our sins. . .

Thus Christ satisfies God's requirement and removes our sin.
In Him we are forgiven and purified. . .

No one, no matter what he or she has done is beyond forgiveness.
All a person has to do is to turn from ALL known sin, receive Christ's
forgiveness, and commit his or her life to Him. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I am a sinful human being, not deserving of Your mercy,
but by Christ's blood, I come before you in repentance, seeking
Your forgiveness, in Jesus Name. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
