Today's Verse: Psalms 12:6 (NLT)

The Lord's promises are pure, like silver refined in a furnace, purified
seven times over. 



Today's Thoughts:

Sincerity and truth are extremely valuable because they are becoming more
and more rare.

Many people have become deceivers, liars, and flatterers-they believe they
will get what 

they want by deception. As a king David certainly faced these kind of
people, who hoped 

to win his favor and gain advancement through flattery. When we feel as
though sincerity 

and truth have nearly gone out of existence, we still have on hope. . .



That hope is the Word of God-God's words are as flawless as refined silver-

So we need to listen closely when He speaks.



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, as You know the world has become filled with those who

want to get ahead by deceit. We need to become more wise than a fox, while
we

keep our focus on You. Help us to be more sensitive to You Holy Spirit's
guidance. . . Amen.
