Today's Verses: Psalms 11:1-4 (NLT)

I trust in the Lord for protection. So why do you say to me, "Fly like a
bird to the mountains for safety!

2 The wicked are stringing their bows and fitting their arrows on the
bowstrings. They shoot from the shadows at those whose hearts are right.

3 The foundations of law and order have collapsed. What can the righteous
do?" 
4 But the Lord is in his holy Temple; the Lord still rules from heaven. He
watches everyone closely, examining every person on earth. 



Today's thoughts:

David was forced to flee for safety several times. Even being God's anointed
king did not make him immune to injustice

and hatred from others. David fled, but not as if all was lost. He knew that
God was in control-While David wisely

avoided trouble, he did not fearfully run away from his troubles. David was
comforted and optimistic because he

knew God was greater than anything his enemies could bring against him.



Let us not forget that faith in God keeps us from losing hope and helps us
resist fear.



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, I thank You, for being in control of all situations. Much like in
the day of David I often believe that the

foundation of the Law is collapsing. It seems as though evil has the upper
hand. But I know that You are always 

watching and that in the end righteousness will win out. . . Amen.
