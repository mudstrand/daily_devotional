Today's Verses: Psalms 15:3-4 (NLT)

Those (with blameless hearts) refuse to gossip or harm their neighbors or
speak evil of their friends.

4 Those who despise flagrant sinners, and honor the faithful followers of
the Lord, 

Today's Thoughts:

Remember this-words are powerful and how you use them reflects on your
relationship with God.

There possibly isn't anything that identifies Christians as their ability to
control their speech-

speaking the truth-refusing to slander-and keeping oaths (promises). Always
watch what you say. . . 



(See what James 3:1-13 says about the importance of controlling the tongue)

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, give me a thankful heart and the determination to live like
Jesus-

help me to live my thanksgiving by a reverent and cheerful obedience to

Your will and by a steadfast trust in Your loving kindness and unfailing

mercy. . . Amen.
