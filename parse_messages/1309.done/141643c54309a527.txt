Today's Verses: Psalms 14:4-6 (NLT)

4 Will those who do evil never learn? They eat up my people like bread and
wouldn't think of praying to the Lord.

5 Terror will grip them, for God is with those who obey him.

6 The wicked frustrate the plans of the oppressed, but the Lord will protect
his people. 

Today's Thoughts:

There is a clear distinction between those who worship God AND those who
refuse to.

Under the leadership of David Israel prospered-BUT several hundred years
later, Israel

forgot God, and it became difficult to distinguish between God's followers
and those

who worshiped idols. . .



When Isaiah called Israel to repentance, he like David, spoke of people who
had gone astray

(Isa. 53:6)-But Isaiah was talking about the Israelites themselves. Paul
quoted (Ps. 13) in

(Ro. 3:10-12). He made the image of straying sheep even more
general-referring to all people.



Let us not be fooled the whole human race-Jews and Gentiles alike-have
turned away from God.

BUT don't forget the words of vs. 5 and 6 we are not fighting a losing
battle our ultimate victory

is in God. . . 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Oh Lord we live in a sad generation-sin in the world has become so
prevalent-without You

there would be no victory, but those who will obey You-You will protect and
victory will 

come from You. Thanks for that. . . Amen
