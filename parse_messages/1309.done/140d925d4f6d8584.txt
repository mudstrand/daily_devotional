Today's Verses: Psalms 9:4-9 (NLT)

For you have judged in my favor; from your throne you have judged with
fairness.

5 You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked; you have erased
their names forever.

6 The enemy is finished, in endless ruins; the cities you uprooted are now
forgotten. 
7 But the Lord reigns forever, executing judgment from his throne.

8 He will judge the world with justice and rule the nations with fairness.

9 The Lord is a shelter for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. 



Today's Thoughts:

God upholds our just cause; He is our vindicator (one who clears us from
criticism and justifies us before others.)

In this life we may face many injustices:

(1) We may be falsely accused and misunderstood by friends and enemies;

(2) We may not be fully appreciated by others for the love we show;

(3) The true value of our work and service may not be duly rewarded;

(4) Our ideas may be ignored.

But God is to be praised, for He sees and remembers all the good we do,

and it is up to Him to decide the timing and the appropriateness of our
rewards.

If we do not trust Him to vindicate us, then we will be susceptible to
hatred and self-pity.

If we do trust Him, we can experience God's peace, and be free from worry of
how others perceive us and treat us. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father give me the patience to wait on Your timing.

I thank You also, for the peace that is freely given when I place my trust
in You.

I pray that I would be obedient to Your Holy Spirit's guidance. 

Give me a teachable spirit I pray. . Amen.
