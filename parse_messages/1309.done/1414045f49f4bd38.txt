When I received my home town paper yesterday I couldn't help laughing

I just had to share it with you all.



An atheist was seated next to a little girl on an airplane and he turned to
her and said,

"Do you want to talk? Flights go quicker if you strike up a conversation
with your

fellow passenger."



The little girl who had just stated to read her book, replied to the total
stranger, "What

do you want to talk about?"



"Oh I don't know," said the atheist. "How about why there is no God, or no
heaven, or

or no hell, or no life after death?" as he smiled smugly.



"Okay," she said. Those could be interesting topics but let me ask you a
question first.

A horse, a cow, and a deer all eat the same stuff - grass. Yet a deer
excretes little pellets,

while a cow turns out a flat patty, but a horse produces clumps. Why do you
suppose that is?"



The atheist, visibly surprised by the little girl's intelligence, thought
about it and said, "Hmmm

I have no idea."



To which the little girl replied, "Do you really feel qualified to discuss
God, Heaven and Hell,

or life after death, when you don't know crap?" and she went back to reading
her book. 



(come on Mike keep turning them out)
