Today's Verses: Psalms 10:7-11 (NLT)

7 Their mouths are full of cursing, lies, and threats. Trouble and evil are
on the tips of their tongues.

8 They lurk in ambush in the villages, waiting to murder innocent people.
They are always searching for helpless victims.

9 Like lions crouched in hiding, they wait to pounce on the helpless. Like
hunters they capture the helpless and drag them away in nets.

10 Their helpless victims are crushed; they fall beneath the strength of the
wicked.

11 The wicked think, "God isn't watching us! He has closed his eyes and
won't even see what we do!" 



Today's Thoughts:

Have you ever said to yourself-"Well I'm not to bad. I'm a pretty good
person."

Look at these verses again and see if any of them apply to you.

Have you ever lied? Have you ever hurt someone's feelings by your words or
tone of voice/?

Are you bitter toward anyone? Do you become angry with those who strongly
disagree with you?

In thought word and deed, you like everyone else in the world, stand guilty
before God.

We must remember who we are in His sight-alienated sinners.

Don't deny that you are a sinner. Instead, allow your desperate need to
point you to God



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father I have to confess that I have sinned against You in
thought-word-and deed, for 

Wich I have no excuse other than I am a sinful human being-I beg for Your
forgiveness. . . Amen
