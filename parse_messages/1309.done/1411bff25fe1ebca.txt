Today's Verse: Psalms 10:1 (NLT)

O Lord, why do you stand so far away? Why do you hide when I am in trouble?



Today's Thoughts:

"Why do You hide when I need You the most?" to the psalmist, God seemed far
away.

But even though the writer had honest doubts, he did not stop praying or
conclude that

God no longer cared. He was not complaining but simply asking God to hurry
to his aid.



It is during those times when we feel the most alone or oppressed that we
need to keep 

praying, telling God about our troubles. . . 



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord it is during the trials of life that You seem so far away, but I
have found that

they are meant to cause my faith to grow. Help me to be mindful that You are
never any

further away than a prayer so that my faith in You will grow stronger. Guide
and direct

me that I may never stop praying. . . Amen.
