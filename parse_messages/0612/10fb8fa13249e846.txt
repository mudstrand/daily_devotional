GOOD MORNING~~~~& Merry Christmas

Our Devotion for Today:

The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation
of His being, sustaining all things by His powerful Word. After He had
provided purification for sins, He sat down at the right hand of the 
Majesty in heaven...(Heb. 1:3) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

I think we would all agree that here again we see the mystery of God's love 
revealed. The book of Hebrews links God's saving power with His creative 
power... In other words, the power that brought the universe into being and 
that keeps it operating is the very power that cleanses our sins...

How mistaken we would be to ever think that God couldn't forgive us. No sin
is the big for the Ruler of the universe to handle. He can and will forgive us 
when we come to Him through His Son...

Through His Love we witness grace upon grace...My you truly experience the 
Mystery of His love for you..

Our Prayer for Today:

Christmas changes everything. It did 2000 years ago when the Word 
first became flesh, and it does each year--if we open ourselves to the
mystery, the longing and the power of that event in the Bethlehem stable.
Oh Lord make me sensitive once again as in the days of my childhood
to the Mystery of You Love...Amen.

Keep Looking Up, prepare to celebrate His return...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather...

I'm so thankful to have e-mail once again after five weeks with-out...
Have a blessed Christmas...
