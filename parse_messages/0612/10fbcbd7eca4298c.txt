GOOD MORNING!!!~~~~~(food for thought)~~~Offer someone today your shoulder to lean on

Our Meditation Today:
He also says, "In the beginning, O Lord, You laid the foundations of the earth,
and the heavens are the work of Your hands...

They will perish, but You remain; they will all wear out like a garment...

You will roll them up like a robe; like a garment they will be changed. But You
remain the same, and Your years will never end...(Heb. 1:10-12) NIV

Our Thought for Today:
The author here has just quoted Ps. 102:25-27...

When he speaks of the earth and the heavens rolled up like a garment, he is 
revealing that the earth is not permanent or indestructible...

Jesus' authority is established over all of creation, so we dare not treat any 
created objects or earthly resources as more important than He is...

So as we are coming to the close of 2006 let us resolve to put God first in
our life...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, I have not lived this past year as I should have, often
times I have put people and things ahead of You; forgive me Lord
for my sin, and create in me a pure heart...Protect our troops in the
coming days...Amen.

Keep looking up, He loves you and wants you as His child...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
