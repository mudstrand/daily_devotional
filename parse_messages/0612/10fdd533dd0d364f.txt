GOOD MORNING!!!~~~~~~(food for thought)~~~Have a firm hand shake...

Our Meditation for Today:
But we see Jesus who was a little lower than the angels, 
now crowned with glory and honor because He suffered
death, so that by the grace of God He might taste death
for everyone...(Heb. 2:9) NIV

Our Thought for Today:
God's grace to us led Christ to His death. Jesus did not come 
into the world to gain status or political power, but to suffer and 
die that we could have eternal life...

If it is difficult for us to identify with Christ's servant attitude, perhaps
we need to evaluate our own motives. Are we more interested in power 
or participation, domination or service, getting or giving???

We need to make an honest effort to examine our motives...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, I thank You for what Jesus did for me!!!
I pray that my motives would be pure, so that my life
would be truly lived in service to You...Amen.

Keep looking up, if you believe you will achieve...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
