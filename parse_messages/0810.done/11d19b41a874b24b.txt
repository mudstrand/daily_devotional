(I Jn.2:10).

Our Verses for Today:

I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my
prayers...

I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious 
Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that
you may know Him better...(Eph. 1:16, 17) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Paul's prayer was that the Ephesians would come to know Christ
better. This should be the prayer of every Christian, because Christ
is to be our model, and the more we know Him, the more we will
be like Him...

If we study Jesus' life in the Gospels we will see what He was like
2000 years ago, this will cause us to know Him better...

A personal knowledge of Christ will change your life...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father I pray for the wisdom to come
into a closer relationship with Your Son Jesus Christ, 
so that I might become more like Him...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is only a prayer away
You are in the prayers of two who care
Pastor Al and Marcie Sather


Ps. Marcie and I had a wonderful time but it is wonderful
to be home too. We traveled through 19 states and through 
two Canadian Provinces...We met some unique people and 
some wonderful Christians...Marcie kept a journal of the people 
we ate with each day on the train. I believe we have over six hundred
pictures on DVD...
