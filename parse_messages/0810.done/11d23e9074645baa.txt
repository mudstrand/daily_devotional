10/22/08~~~(food for thought)~~~"We are made alive in Christ Jesus."

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Far above all rule and authority, power and dominion and
every title that can be given, not only in the present age
but also in the one,

God placed all thing under His feet and appointed Him to
be head over everything for the church...(Eph, 1:21, 22) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Having been raised from the dead, Christ is now the head of
the church, the ultimate authority over the world. Jesus is the 
messiah, God's anointed one, the one Israel longed for, the
one who would set their broken world right...

As Christian we can be confident that God has won the final
victory and is in control of everything...

Our Prayer for Today:
I thank You Lord for the assurance that I have a sure foundation 
when I place my faith in You. Block from my mind all that would
cause me to...Amen.

Keep looking up, and receive His many blessings...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
