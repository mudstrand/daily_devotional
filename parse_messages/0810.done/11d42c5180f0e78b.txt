Our Bible Verse for Today:

God raised us up with Christ and seated us with Him in the
heavenly realms in Christ Jesus...(Eph. 2:6) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Because of Christ's resurrection, we know that our body will also
be raised from the dead (I Cor. 15:2-23) and that we will be given 
the power to live as Christians now (Eph. 1:19)...

These ideas are combined in Paul's image of sitting with Christ in 
the "heavenly realm". Our eternal life with Christ is certain because 
we are united in His powerful victory...

This all came into being because of His great love for us...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the assurance we have
of a resurrected life with you, I also thank you for the assurance
that Your Holy Spirit is beside me to guide and direct my foot
steps into a closer walk with You. Bless all my e-mail friends with 
good health and safety this week...Amen.

Keep looking up, place your hand in the hand
of the man who stilled the waters...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
