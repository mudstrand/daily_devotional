10/22/08~~~(food for thought)~~~Every Christian is called to be God's people...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

God placed all things under His feet and appointed Him 
to be head over everything for the Church,

which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills everything
in every way...(Eph. 1:22, 23) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Christ fills the faithful church with gifts and blessings. The
church should be the full expression of Christ, who Himself
fills everything (see Eph. 3:19)...

When reading Ephesians it is important to remember that it
was written primarily to the entire church, not merely to an
individual. Christ is the head, and we are the body of His church.

Paul uses this metaphor in Ro. 12:4, 5; I Cor.12:12-27 and
Col. 3:15. The image of the body shows the church's unity.
Each member is involved with all the others as they go about
doing Christ's word on earth...

We should not attempt to work, serve, or worship merely on
our own. We need the entire body...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray for continued unity in the church.
Help each member be of one mind in all things. open our hearts
to receive Godly wisdom from above. Bless each and everyone
who reads this devotional with good health and safety...Amen.

Keep looking up, His eye is on the sparrow
and is surely on you...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
