10/24/08~~~(food for thought)~~~It is up to every Christian to show the world who God is...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins,

In which you used to live when you followed the ways of this 
world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who
is now at work in those who are disobedient...(Eph. 2:1,2) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

The 'ruler of the kingdom of the air' is Satan.
Paul's readers believe that Satan and the evil spiritual forces
inhabited the region between earth and the sky...

And so Satan is pictured as ruling an evil spiritual kingdom ~
with the demons and those who are against Christ. Satan means 
"the accuser" He is also called the Devil (4:27)...

In the resurrection, Christ was victorious over Satan and his power.
So now Christ is the permanent ruler of the whole world; Satan is
only the temporary ruler of the part of the world that chooses to
follow him...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that Satan's kingdom would
continue to grow smaller and smaller, while the citizens of 
Your kingdom would grow larger and larger. I pray that there
would be a revival in the world ~ a true awakening. I pray that
this would be the prayer of every Christian...Amen.

Keep looking up, He has promised He will return...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
