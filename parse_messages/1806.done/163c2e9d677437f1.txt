VERSE FOR TODAY:

_Truth stands the test of time; lies are soon exposed,_ (Pro. 12:19)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

Truth is always timely, it applies today and in the future. Because
it

is connected with God's changeless character, IT is also changeless.

Think for a moment about the centuries that have passed since these

proverbs were written. Consider the countless hours that have been

carefully spent studding every sentence of Scriptures. The Bible has

withstood the test of time. Because God is truth, you can trust His

Word to guide you.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your Word which is

the same yesterday, today, and for ever. I thank You that it

has withstood the test of time, and that it is a guiding light to

all who believe. . . Amen.
