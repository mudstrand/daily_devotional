VERSE FOR TODAY:

_An empty stable stays clean, but no income comes from an empty_

_stable._ (Pro. 14:4)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

When a farmer has no cattle, the stable will be clean, but he will

be unable to make a living. The only way to keep your life clean

of people problems, is to keep it free from of people. But if your

life is empty of people, it is useless, and if you live only for
your-

self, your life loses its meaning. Instead of avoiding people, we

should serve others, share our faith, and work for justice. Is your

life free but empty? Or does it give evidence of your serving God

wholeheartedly.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear heavenly Father, help me to be a truthful witness in all that

I say and do. May my words always be words of praise in Your

name. . .Amen.
