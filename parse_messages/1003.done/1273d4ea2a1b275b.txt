03/08/2010~~~food for thought~~~WHY ~ THE NAME JESUS?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
(The angel said to Joseph concerning Mary)
"And she will have a son, and you are to name Him Jesus." (Mt. 1:21)

Our Lesson for Today:
How often do you think of what the name 'Jesus' means?
It means, "The Lord saves." Jesus came to earth to save us because 
we can not save ourselves from sin and its consequences. No matter
how good we are, we can't eliminate the sinful nature present in all of us...

ONLY Jesus can do that. Jesus DID NOT come to help people save
themselves; He came to be their Savior from the power and penalty of sin.
We should continually thank Jesus for His death on the cross for our sins,
AND THEN ask Him to take control of our life. Your new life begins at that
very moment...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I thank you for being my substitute, in going the way 
of the cross. Come into my heart, and take control of my life...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
