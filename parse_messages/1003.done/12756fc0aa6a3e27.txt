03/13/2010~~~food for thought~~~PRAISE FOR HIS NAME ~ THE WAY...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
I am the way...No one comes to the Father except through Me...(Jn. 14:6)

Our Lesson for Today:
How often have we turned to the one reading a map and asked the question, 
"Which road do I take," when entering a strange city? ~ When the way to heaven
is involved, we better have the right road, or we'll waste more than time...

Jesus knows where we want to go. Ever since sin slammed shut not only the door 
to Eden but also to heaven, Man's been looking for the road back. Like some prodigal
son, He's been roaming far from home, but unlike that boy, he doesn't know the way
back. Though he tries to push his anxious concerns about eternity to the back of
his mind, they still sit there bothering him...

But we know the way! ~ Jesus has told us. "I am the way." He's not just some highway 
marker like the one pointing to the bypass around some strange city. He's the road itself.
and what a highway He is! ~ Straight as an arrow. ~ smoother than freshly cured cement.
Never a detour and not one orange barrel. No toll booths to clog up the traffic flow and
collect our cash...

He is the way, the only way to the Father's house above. With His death and resurrection
as payment for all sin, He made Himself the free-way to heaven, one that asks nothing 
from us, because it took everything from Him...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, direct and keep my feet in faith on You as the
only way to the Fathers house...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
