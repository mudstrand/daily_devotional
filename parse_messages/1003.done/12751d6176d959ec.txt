03/12/2010~~~food for thought~~~PRAISE HIS NAME CARPENTER...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Where did this man get these thing?........
Isn't this the carpenter? (Mark 6:2, 3)

Our Lesson for Today:
They called Him "The carpenter" that day to belittle Him.
Yet when we stop to think, isn't that a good name for Jesus?
He's the heavenly Carpenter...

Just think what a carpenter does. He builds and fixes.
"Through Him all things were made," John 1:3 reminds me.
Till time's end, He's still busy. "On this rock I will build my church," He said (Mt. 16:18)

With His gospel this Carpenter adds people to His invisible church of believers
that reaches into eternity, ~ best of all He's my Carpenter. Not only did He make
me through my parents. He also remade me, turning the sinful wreck I was from 
my mother's womb into a believer and fixing every day dents sin still gouges into
my faith...

What a name, Carpenter, my Savior-God has, one that deserves my praise all my days!

Prayer Suggestion:
Lord, thank You for crafting and keeping me as something
precious for Your Father's house...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
