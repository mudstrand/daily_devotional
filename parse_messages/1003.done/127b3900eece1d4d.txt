03/31/2010 ~~~ food for thought~~~FORGIVE THEM...
Take the time to really grasp what this means...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Father, forgive them, for they do not know what
they are doing. (Lk. 23:34)

Our Lesson for Today:
The sound of the hammer had barely faded when the Savior spoke.
His first sentence from the cross was not a cry of pain or a curse of hatred.
It was a prayer asking His Father to forgive those who crucified Him...

"Father," He prayed ~ that word speaks of the enormity of their crime.
They were killing God's own Son. Wouldn't His holy hand be already streaking 
down to seize the guilty and grind them into pieces?

"Forgive," Jesus continued, using a word that meant to dismiss, to send out
of sight. ~ His Father knew why Jesus prayed this. ~ His Son was on the that
cross paying for the sins of these people too. ~ His sacrifice made His prayer
the mightiest ever spoken. "Them." Jesus said. He mentioned no names so
I can put mine there. ~ You are invited to do the same. ~ He had Luke record it 
so we could read it...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me appreciate that You were praying about me.
Oh how I need Your prayer daily! Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
