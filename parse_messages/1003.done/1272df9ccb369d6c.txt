03/05/2010~~~food for thought~~~FOR ME HE DIED...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
I myself no longer live, but Christ lives in me. So I live my life in this earthly
body by trusting in the Son of God, Who loved me and gave Himself for me. (Gal. 2:20)

Our Lesson for Today:
Here is a question we may hear now and then, "How have we been crucified with Christ?"
The answer is Legally, God looks at us as if we had died with Christ. Because our sins 
died with Him, we are no longer condemned (Col. 2:13-15).

Relationally, ~ we have become one with Christ, and His experiences are ours.
Our Christian life began when, in unity with Him, we died to our old life (see Ro. 6:5-11).

In our daily life, ~ we must regularly crucify sinful desires that keep us from following
Christ. This, too, is a kind of dying with Him (Lk. 9:23-25). AND yet, the focus of Christianity 
is not dying but living. BECAUSE we have been crucified with Christ, we ALSO have been
raised with Him (Ro. 6:5)... He is our power for living AND our hope for the future (Col. 1:27).

Prayer Suggestion:
Thank You Lord, for offering Yourself for my sins,
Thank You Lord, for the power for living and my hope
for the future, a place You have prepared for me...Amen.

No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
