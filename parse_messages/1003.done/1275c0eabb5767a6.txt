03/14/2010~~~food for thought~~~PRAISE FOR HIS NAME ~ THE TRUTH...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
I am...the Truth...No one comes to the Father except
through Me...(John 14:6)

Our Lesson for Today:
The world is filled with all kinds of truth. People have rummaged in the ruins of the past,
they've worked at classifying the animal, vegetable, mineral kingdoms, split atoms,
and orbited satellites. Yet none of these so-called truths can answer the question, 
What must I do to be saved?

There only Jesus will do. That's His claim when He says, "I am the truth." Notice what
He says. It isn't "I am truthful." BUT of course He is. The sinless Son of God cannot lie.
NOR does He say, "I'll tell you the truth." The prophets and apostles did that. They were 
only mouthpieces, proclaiming truths that were given to them. Jesus is so much more...

Jesus is truth itself. If it were mathematics, we'd say, "Jesus = truth" or "Jesus = salvation."
He is truth in action. What a name, the Truth, my Savior-God has, one that deserves my 
praise all my days!

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, fill my heart with You as my Savior for then
I will know the way to my Father...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
