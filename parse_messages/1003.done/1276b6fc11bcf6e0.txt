03/17/2010~~~food for thought~~~HIS LOVE NEVER FAILS...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
(Peter denies knowing Christ) At that moment the Lord turned and looked
at Peter. Then Peter remembered that the Lord had said, "Before the rooster 
crows tomorrow morning, you will deny Me three times." (Lk. 22:62)

Our Lesson for Today:
Peter wept bitterly, not only because he realized that he had denied his Lord,
the Messiah, but also because he had turned away from a very dear friend, a 
person who had loved and taught him for three years. Peter said that he would 
never deny Christ...

But when frightened, he went against all he had boldly promised. Unable to 
stand up for his Lord for even 12 hours, he had failed as a disciple and as a
friend...

We need to be aware of own breaking points and not become overconfident
or self-sufficient. If we fail Him, we must remember that Christ can use those 
who recognize their failure. From his humiliating experience Peter learned much 
that would help him later when he assumed leadership of the young church...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, You know my weakness, look upon me with
Your love and reclaim me when I stray...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
