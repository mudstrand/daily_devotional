03/19/2010~~~food for thought~~~WHAT WONDROUS LOVE...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
He [Herod] asked Jesus, question after question, but Jesus refused 
to answer...(Lk. 23:9)

Our Lesson for Today:
We just aren't used to Jesus being silent. ~ Isn't this the same Jesus who went 
everywhere preaching the gospel? ~ Yet before Herod's judgment seat, the Savior
remained silent...

Well Peter tells us why, "When they hurled their insults at Him, He didn't retaliate;
when He suffered, He made no threats. ~ Instead, He entrusted Himself to Him
who judges justly" (I Peter 2:23). Did you hear that? ~ Jesus' silence was dictated
by His love. ~ Instead of striking back at His enemies, He said nothing. ~ His love
wouldn't let Him hurt them. ~ Instead of hurling greater insults at them, He was silent.
His love for His Father wouldn't do what His Father said was wrong. ~ Love dictated
His silence... 

But He has words for me. "Go in peace," He says when I haul my tonnage of sin before 
Him each day." ~ "Plunged into the depths of the sea," He comforts me when those
"special" sins rub my conscience sore. ~ From His silence before Herod come words
of wondrous love...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, continue to tell me of Your saving love
and keep my heart listening...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to The father except through me." - John: 14:6
