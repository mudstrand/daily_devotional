03/18/2010~~~food for thought~~~CAN WE EXPLAIN THE LOVE?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
(Jesus before the council of religious leaders)
The time is soon coming when I, the Son of man, will be sitting
at God's right hand in the place of power." (Lk. 22:69)

Our Lesson for Today:
The accused was totally innocent and yet completely guilty. An impartial eye could 
pick out the flaws in His trial. Jesus was standing before a kangaroo court that only
needed an appropriate charge for the verdict already decided. "Guilty," the court 
judged Him, though He was totally innocent...

Our was He? In heaven a Higher Judge was on the bench. And He had already 
declared His sinless, perfect Son guilty, horribly guilty, because of the load He 
was carrying. Remember what the load was? "We all, like sheep, have gone astray."
Isa. wrote (53:6). Remember how he continued? "And the Lord has laid on Him the
iniquity of us all."

How do we begin to describe the guilt that the Father saw, when He looked at our
substitute in that courtroom? Even more, how do we begin to explain the love that
made it happen?

Someday it'll be my turn in court, and I who am completely guilty, will be declared 
totally innocent. Let the unbelievers, shiver at the thought of standing before the
Righteous Judge on that last day.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, thank You for taking my guilt
and giving me Your innocence...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
