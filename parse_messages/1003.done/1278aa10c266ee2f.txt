03/23/2010~~~food for thought~~~LET US SING HOSANNA WITH OUR LIPS AND OUR LIVES...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them and 
Jesus sat on them. A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road,
and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
(Mt. 21:7, 8)

Our Lesson for Today:
They praised Jesus with their lips and hands that first Palm Sunday.
The disciples did it by following Jesus' orders and fetching the donkey.
The people did it by rolling out the red carpet of their own cloaks and
palm branches...

Yes they eagerly praised Him, even though few fully knew the right reason
why. Today we celebrate this event on Palm Sunday. That day should
remind us to guard against superficial acclaim of Christ...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me live my hosannas...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to The Father except through me." - John: 14:6
