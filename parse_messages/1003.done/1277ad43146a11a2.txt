03/20/2010~~~food for thought~~~LOVE ON THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Jesus turned and said to them, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me;
weep for yourselves and for you children." (Lk. 23:28)

Our Lesson for Today:
Wouldn't we have cried too, if we had been standing with those women? ~ And 
wouldn't you think that Jesus would have wanted our tears? When we suffer, don't
we appreciate sympathy. But not our Lord Jesus. Dragging His cross through the
streets of Jerusalem, he says, "Do not weep for Me."

Why not? ~ Because all was well with Him. ~ He knew that the way His Father had 
chosen to free the world from sin's hellish curse was by His making those bloody 
footprints to a hill called Calvary. ~ As the loving Son of the Eternal Father and as 
the everlasting friend of sinners, He was willing to walk that path...

It is time to check our heart and life again, isn't it? ~ Any sin there that we've become 
comfortable with? ~ Any sin that we've willingly made our bedfellow? ~ Is there any sin 
that we've told God to keep His fingers off? ~ Well then perhaps it's time to hear His 
words of love warning us, even as He seeks to call us back...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, in my weakness and with my sins, Help me
hear Your loving voice calling me...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
