03/25/2010~~~food for thought~~~KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE GOOD SHEPHERD...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
The Lord is my shepherd. 
(We should recognize this as being the first line of, Ps. 23:1)

Our Lesson for Today:
The new T. calls Jesus the Good Shepherd (Jn. 10:11).
the Great Shepherd (Heb. 13:20)
The Head Shepherd (1 Pet. 5:4)

As the Lord is the Good Shepherd, so we are His sheep ~ not frightened, 
passive animals, but obedient followers, wise enough to follow one who
will lead us in the right places and in right ways. 

As we will see in the next few days, this psalm does not focus on the animal-like 
qualities of sheep but on the discipleship qualities of those who follow. Let us in 
the next few days examine our discipleship qualities, to see where we stand. 
I will share my thoughts on the rest of the this week Psalm...
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

When you recognize the Good Shepherd, follow Him!!!
