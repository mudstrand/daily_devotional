03/03/2010~~~food for thought~~~THOSE NAIL-PIERCED HANDS...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
They have pierced My hands and My feet...(Ps. 22:16)

Our Lesson for Today:
Scars on our hands ~ maybe from some knife that slipped or disease that crippled.
there's usually a story behind those scars. Jesus' hands have scares too and behind 
them is the greatest story the world has ever heard...

David foretold it, and the gospels record it, using simple words. But there was nothing 
simple about it. Splintery wood and sharp nails, torn flesh and screaming nerve endings, 
constant pain and slow death ~ was involved in crucifixion. and far worse were the tortures
of hell...

All the pains of hell that were the wages for the world's sins crushed down on Jesus
pierced on that cross. Only the devils and the damned in hell can begin to understand.
We can only guess at what this involved for Jesus...

There's no guessing, though, as to who pierced His hands and feet. Don't forget for a 
moment it was "I who pierced His hands and His feet." I with my many sins did it...
So look at those nail-pierced hands! They have a story to tell. They speak of full payment 
for the world's sins. THEY SPEAK ~ THEY SHOUT ~ TO ME ABOUT MY SALVATION!

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me listen! Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to The Father except through me." - John: 14:6
