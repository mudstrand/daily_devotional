03/06/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE CROSS IS THE ONLY WAY...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be 
gained by keeping the law, then Christ died for nothing...(Gal. 2:21)

Our Lesson for Today:
It is sad to say that believers today may still be in danger of acting as if Christ
died for nothing. HOW? By believing they can earn God's favor by what they
do. ~ HOW SO? They are not trusting completely in Christ's work on the cross...

By struggling to appropriate God's power to change themselves, they are not
resting in God's power to save them. IF we could be saved by being good, then
Christ would not have had to die. But the cross is the only way to salvation...

In John 4:34 Jesus says: "He came to finish God's work of salvation."
John 17:4 He did everything that was required, to pay the full penalty for our sins. 
NOW, we can freely approach God because of what Jesus did for us ~ Those who 
believe in Jesus' death and resurrection can live eternally with God and escape the 
penalty that comes from sin..

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I thank You, for loving me so much that
You were willing to die for me...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
