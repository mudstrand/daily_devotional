03/16/2010~~~food for thought~~~LOVE IN GETHSEMANE...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Being in anguish, He prayed more earnestly, and His sweat 
was like drops of blood falling to the ground...(Lk. 22:44)

Our Lesson for Today:
What was it that caused my Savior to plead "Take this cup from me," in the garden?
I hope we don't forget the answer we have heard in other Lenten seasons. That cup
was filled with the bitter portions of Hell's punishment for sin...

No wonder Jesus turns to His Father pleading, "Take this cup from me." Who can
disagree that sin must be serious, look what it does to Jesus. Each of my sins was a
drop of poison in that cup, Each one brought drops of blood to Jesus' scalp.

How Jesus must love me to be willing to do this for a sinner like me! Gethsemane was
only an olive garden in those days. But I remember it because of Jesus' wondrous love.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, when my sins give me alarm, show me 
again Your love in Gethsemane's garden...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
