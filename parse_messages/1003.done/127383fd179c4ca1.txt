03/07/2010~~~food for thought~~~OUR ONLY SAVIOR...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and
they will call Him Immanuel" which means, God with us." (Mt. 1:23)

Our Lesson for Today:
What a beautiful name for my Savior, Immanuel ~ God with us. In this 
statement there are two comforting truths. The first is that Jesus is God. 
If you were to eliminate that truth what would that baby mean to me? 
He'd be just another baby...

And what would that figure on the cross 33 years later mean to me?
He'd just be another innocent victim nailed there by some miscarriage of
justice. If He were not God, then His blood could hardly purify me from 
all sin...

The second truth is in his name Immanuel also "God with us." What a
comforting thought, He is never far from us. He is with us in our flesh,
on our globe, He is near even when I sin, not to cause them or share in
them but to save me from them. He has already paid for them...

Yes He is with us through every trial, giving us the strength to keep moving
forward...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I thank You for coming to the manger and the
cross to be my only Savior...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
