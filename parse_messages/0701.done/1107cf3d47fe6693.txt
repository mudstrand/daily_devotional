GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~It's OK to get angry with God. He can take it...

Our Meditation for Today:

During the days of Jesus' life on earth, He offered up 
prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the 
One who could save Him from death, and He was 
heard because of His reverent submission...(Heb. 5:7) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Jesus was in great agony as He prepared to faced death (Lk. 22:41-44).
Although Jesus cried out to God, asking to be delivered, He was 
prepared to suffer humiliation, separation from His Father, and death
in order to do God's will...

At times we will undergo trials, not because we want to suffer, but because
we want to obey God. Let Jesus' obedience sustain and encourage you
in times of trial...

You will be able to face anything if you know that Jesus Christ is with you.
Have you ever felt that God didn't hear your prayers? Be sure you are 
praying with reverent submission, willing to do what God wants. God 
responds to His obedient children...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I can not even imagine what You felt
as You approached the time of Your separation from Your 
Father, but I do thank You for being obedient to the Father's
will. I pray for a greater sensitivity and obedience to His will.
I pray for obedience that I may become a better witness for
Him, in Jesus name Amen...

keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
