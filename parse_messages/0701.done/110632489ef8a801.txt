GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Don't take yourself so seriously. No one else does...

Our Meditation for Today:

Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight.
Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the
eyes of Him to whom we must give an account...(Heb. 4:13) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Nothing can be hidden from God. He knows about everyone 
every where, and everything about us is wide open to His all
seeing eyes...

God sees all we do and knows all we think. Even when we are
unaware of His presence, He is there...

When we try to hide from Him, He sees us. We can have no secrets 
from God. But it is comforting to realize that although God knows us 
intimately He still loves us...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, granted it is a little unnerving to think You 
know everything about me; but at the same time it is comforting to
know You still love me...Being You know all things then You know
that I have much to confess...Forgive me for my sins of thought,
word, and deed, my sins of commission, and my sins of omission.
I pray all these things in Jesus name...Amen.

Keep looking up with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
