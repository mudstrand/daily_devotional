GOOD MORNING!!!~~~~~~(food for thought)~~~Sing in the shower...

Our Devotion for Today:
Since the children have flesh and blood, He too shared in their
humanity so that by His death He might destroy him who holds
the power of death--that is, the devil--and free those who all their
lives were held in slavery by their fear of death...(Heb. 2:14, 15) NIV

Our Thought for Today:
Jesus had to become human so that He could die and rise again,
in order to destroy the Devil's power over death. (see Ro. 6:5-11)

Only then could Christ deliver those who had lived in constant fear
of death and free them to live for Him...Christ's death and resurrection
has set us free from the fear of death because death has been defeated.

When we belong to God, we need not fear death, because we know
that death is only the doorway into eternal life. (see I Cor. 15)

Those who fear death should have the opportunity to know the hope 
that Christ's victory binges...Begin to seek ways to share the truth with
those close to you...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You that the doorway to 
eternal life has been opened...I thank You for defeating 
death...Help me to see every opportunity to share the truth...Amen.

Keep looking up, if you believe you will achieve...
you're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
