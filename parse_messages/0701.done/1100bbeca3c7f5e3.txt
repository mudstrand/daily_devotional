GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Buy great books even if you never read them...

Our Meditation for Today:

But Christ is faithful as a son over God's house. 
And we are His house, if we hold on to our courage 
and the hope of which we boast. (Heb. 3:6) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Because Christ lives in us as believers, we can remain courageous
and hopeful to the end... We are not saved by being steadfast and
firm in our faith, BUT, our courage and hope do reveal that our faith
is real...

Without this enduring faithfulness, we could easily be blown away by
the winds of temptation, false teaching, or persecution...(see 3:14).

Our Prayer for Today:
I thank You for Your presence in my life through the Holy Spirit.
Help me to always be alert to any false teaching that Satan would
try to plant in my life...I pray You would bless and keep each and 
every person receiving this e-mail...Amen.

Keep looking up, if you believe you will achieve...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
