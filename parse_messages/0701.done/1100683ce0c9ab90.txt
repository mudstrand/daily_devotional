WHEN CHRIST COMES - - - 
by Max Lucado 
You are in your car driving home. 
Thoughts wander to the game you want to see or meal you want to 
eat, when suddenly a sound unlike any you've ever heard fills the air. 
The sound is high above you. 
A trumpet? 
A choir? 
A choir of trumpets? 
You don't know, but you want to know. 
So you pull over, get out of your car, and look up. 
As you do, you see you aren't the only curious one. 
The roadside has become a parking lot. 
Car doors are open, and people are staring at the sky. 
Shoppers are racing out of the grocery store. 
The Little League baseball game across the street has come to a 
halt. 
Players and parents are searching the clouds. 
And what they see, and what you see, has never before been seen. 
As if the sky were a curtain, the drapes of the atmosphere part. 
A brilliant light spills onto the earth. 
There are no shadows. 
None. 
From whence came the light begins to tumble a river of color 
spiking crystals of every hue ever seen and a million more never seen. 
Riding on the flow is an endless fleet of angels. 
They pass through the curtains one myriad at a time, until they 
occupy every square inch of the sky. 
North. 
South. 
East. 
West. 
Thousands of silvery wings rise and fall in unison, and over the sound of the trumpets, you can hear the cherubim and ceraphim chanting, 
Holy, holy, holy. 
The final flank of angels is followed by twenty-four silver-bearded elders 
and a multitude of souls who join the angels in worship. 
Presently the movement stops and the trumpets are silent, leaving only the triumphant triplet: Holy, holy, holy. 
Between each word is a pause. 
With each word, a profound reverence. 
You hear your voice join in the chorus. 
You don't know why you say the words, but you know you must. 
Suddenly, the heavens are quiet. All is quiet. 
The angels turn, you turn, the entire world turns and there He is. 
Jesus. 
Through waves of light you see the silhouetted figure of Christ the King. 
He is atop a great stallion, and the stallion is atop a billowing cloud. 
He opens his mouth, and you are surrounded by his declaration: 
I am the Alpha and the Omega. 
The angels bow their heads. 
The elders remove their crowns. 
And before you is a Figure so consuming that you know, instantly you know: 
Nothing else matters. 
Forget stock markets and school reports. 
Sales meetings and football games. 
Nothing is newsworthy.. 
All that mattered, matters no more.... 
for Christ has come. . . 
And, please let me know the exact time you read this. It is mystical--honest 
This morning when the Lord opened a window to Heaven, he saw me, 
and He asked: My child, what is your greatest wish for today? 
I responded: 
"Lord please; take care of the person who is reading this message,their family and their special friends.They deserve it and I love them very much"

The love of God is like the ocean, you can see its beginnings but 
Not its end. This message works on the day you receive it. 
To some it may sound dumb, but the person who sent this to me was 
impressed with its timing. Let us see if it is true. 
ANGELS EXIST, but sometimes, since they don't all have wings we 
call them FRIENDS, SUCH AS YOU.
