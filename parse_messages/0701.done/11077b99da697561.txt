GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Cry with someone. It's more healing than crying alone.

Our Meditation for Today:

Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence,
so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in
our time of need...(Heb. 4:16) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

We approach the throne of grace through prayer not in fear
but "boldly." 

Some Christians approach God meekly with heads hung low,
afraid to ask God to meet their needs. Others pray flippantly,
giving little thought to what they say...

Come with reverence because He is Your King. But also with 
bold assurance because He is your Friend and Counselor...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your Grace and Mercy.
I thank You for my health, home, food, family, e-mail friends, 
and our countries freedoms. BUT most of all I thank You for
my salvation in Jesus Christ. I thank You that I can come to
You with the assurance that You hear my prayers. My request
today is that my family, and e-mail friend would receive good
health and safety...Amen.

Keep looking Up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
