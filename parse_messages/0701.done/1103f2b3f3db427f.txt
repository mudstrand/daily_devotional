GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Return everything you borrow...

If you received this at the beginning of the week let me know I had
four devo's prepared to go out on Tue. morning as I was going to 
be gone for (4) days but the way it appeared they did not go out so
I am sending them individually starting to day...

Our Meditation for Today:

Therefore, since the promise of entering His rest stands,
let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen 
short of it...(Heb. 4:1) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Some of the Jewish Christians who received this letter may have been
on the verge of turning back from their promised rest in Christ, just as
the people of Moses' day had turned back from the promised land...

In both cases, the difficulties of the present moment over-shadowed the
reality of God's promise, and the people doubted that God would fulfil
His promises...

The problem many have today is that they trust in their own efforts instead
of Christ's power, then they are in danger of turning back. They will eventually
see that their own efforts are never adequate; because only Christ can see 
us through...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray for Godly wisdom in how
to deal with problems that come my way. I need this 
wisdom so that I would not look to my own strength or
wisdom in dealing with my everyday problems. Help me
to always depend on You, for in You all things are possible...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
