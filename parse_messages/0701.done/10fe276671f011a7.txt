GOOD MORNING!!!~~~~~(food for thought)~~~Say "thank you" a lot.

Our Meditation for Today:
In bringing many sons to glory, it was fitting that God, 
for whom and through whom everything exists, should
make the author of their salvation perfect through
suffering...(Heb. 2:10)

Our Thought for Today:
Have you ever wondered how Jesus was made perfect through suffering?

Well the suffering that Jesus accepted on our behalf made Him a perfect 
leader or pioneer, of our salvation. Jesus Himself did not need to suffer for
His own salvation, because He was God in human form...

His perfect obedience (which led Him down the road of suffering) demonstrates 
that He was the complete sacrifice for us...

Through suffering, Jesus completed the work necessary for our own salvation.
Our suffering can make us more sensitive servants of God...

People who have known pain are able to reach out with compassion to others 
who hurt. If you have suffered, ask God how your experience can be used to
help others...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the gift of eternal life
that is mine through faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ.
Forgive me for complaining about my trails, and show me how
I can use those experiences to help others...Amen

Keep looking up, if you truly believe you will achieve...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
