GOOD MORNING!!!~~~~~~(food for thought)~~~Be forgiving of yourself and others...

Our Meditation for Today:
See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving 
heart that turns away from the living God...

But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called 
Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's 
deceitfulness...

We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly till the 
end the confidence we had at first...(Heb. 3:12-14) NIV

Our Thought for Today:
Our hearts turn away from the living God when we stubbornly 
refuse to believe in Him. If we persist in our unbelief, God
will eventually leave us alone in our sin...

BUT God can give us new hearts, new desires, and new spirits,
as we see by (Ezek. 36:22-27)...

To prevent having an unbelieving heart, stay in fellowship with 
other believers, talk daily about your mutual faith, be aware of
the deceitfulness of sin (it attacks but also destroys), and 
encourage each other with love and concern...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear heavenly Father, help me to always have a sensitive and 
obedient heart...Create in me a righteous heart, with a desire to
live in closer fellowship with You...Help me to also grow closer in
a mutual faith with other believers, so that we can encourage one
another with love and concern...Amen

Keep looking up, our Savior has promised eternal life...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
