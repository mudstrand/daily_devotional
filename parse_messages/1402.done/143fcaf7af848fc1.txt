Today's Verses: Ps. 39:8-9

8 Rescue me from my rebellion. Do not let fools mock me.

9 I am silent before you; I won't say a word, for my punishment is from you.


Today's Thoughts:

I believe that many people believe that God protects them from trouble, 

so when calamity comes, they begin to question God's goodness and justice.

But in truth we should never give up on God, just because He allows you to 

have a bad experience. Remember that faith in God does not guarantee
personal 

prosperity, and of course lack of faith does not guarantee troubles in this
life.

If this were so, people would believe in God simply to get rich. God is
perfectly 

able to recue us from suffering, but He also may allow suffering to come for


reasons we cannot understand. It is Satan's strategy to get us to doubt God
at 

exactly this moment. If we always knew why we were suffering, our faith
would 

have no room to grow.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, give me a child-like faith, for only You can. Remove my doubts 

and fill me with a simple faith in Your precious promises. . . Amen.

will never enter it. . . (Mk. 10:15)
