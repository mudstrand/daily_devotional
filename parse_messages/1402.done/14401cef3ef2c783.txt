Today's Verse: Ps. 39:10

But please stop striking me! I am exhausted by the blows from your hand. 

Today's Thoughts:

What did David mean when he asked God to stop punishing him with "blows"
from His hand?

It may be a picture of the difficulties David was facing that cause him to
feel as if he were being struck.

(Question) who loves a child more-the father who allows the child to do
what will harm him-or one 

who corrects, trains, and even punishes the child to help him learn what is
right?



It is never pleasant to be corrected and disciplined by God, but His
discipline is a sign of His deep love 

for us. When God corrects you, see it as proof of His love, and ask Him
what He is trying to teach you.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, show me my sins with Your commandments.

Then show me Your forgiveness through the good news 

about Your Son, my Savior. . . Amen.

He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only 

for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. (I Jn. 2:2)
