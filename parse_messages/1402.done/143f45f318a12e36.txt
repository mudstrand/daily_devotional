Today's Verse: Ps. 39:4

Lord, remind me how brief my time on earth will be.

Remind me that my days are numbered- how fleeting my life is. 

Today's Thoughts:

Life is short no matter how long we live. If there is something 

important we want to do, we should not put it off for a better day.

Ask yourself if I had only six months to live, what would I do?



Tell someone that you love him or her?

Deal with an undisciplined area in your life?

Tell someone about Jesus?

Because life is short don't neglect what is truly important.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, it is so easy to get caught up in the busyness of life that 

I often forget how fleeting life really is. Help me to focus on what 

is truly important-eternal life. . . Amen.



Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

If you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart 

that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. (Ro. 10:9)
