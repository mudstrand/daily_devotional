Today's Verses: Ps. 39:5-6

You have made my life no longer than the width of my hand. 

My entire lifetime is just a moment to you; at best, each of us is but a
breath." 
6 We are merely moving shadows, and all our busy rushing ends in nothing. 

We heap up wealth, not knowing who will spend it. 

Today's Thoughts:

The shortness of life is the theme throughout the books of Psalms, Proverbs,
and Ecclesiastes. 

Remember Jesus also spoke about this subject in Lk. 12:20. Now isn't it
funny how people 

spend so much time securing their lives on earth but take little time or
thought about where 

they will spend eternity. David realized that putting together riches and
busily accomplishing 

worldly tasks would make no difference in eternity. It seems that very few
people understand 

that their only hope is in the Lord.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, help me to cast my cares on You, 

trusting in Your loving care for me. . . Amen.

This is how we know what love is: 

Jesus Christ laid down His life for us. (I Jn. 3:16)
