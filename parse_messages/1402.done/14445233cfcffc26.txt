Today's Verses: Ps. 40:4-6

Oh, the joys of those who trust the Lord, who have no confidence in the
proud or in those who worship idols

5 O Lord my God, You have performed many wonders for us. Your plans for us
are too numerous to list. 

You have no equal. If I tried to recite all Your wonderful deeds, I would
never come to the end of them. 
6 You take no delight in sacrifices or offerings. Now that You have made me
listen, I finally understand - 

You don't require burnt offerings or sin offerings. 

Today's Thoughts:

The religious rituals of David's day involved sacrificing animals in the
tabernacle. BUT David said-

These acts were meaningless unless done for the right reasons. TODAY we
often make rituals of going

to church-taking Communion-or paying tithes. These activities are also empty
if our reasons for 

doing them are selfish-

God does not want these sacrifices and offerings without an attitude of
devotion to Him.

Samuel said, "Obedience is far better than sacrifice." (I Sam. 15:22)

Make sure you give God the obedience and life-long service He desires from
you.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, cover me with Your Son's forgiveness that I may be 

pure in Your sight. . . Amen.
