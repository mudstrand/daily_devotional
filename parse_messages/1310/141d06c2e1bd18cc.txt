Today's Verses: Ps. 18:16-19

He reached down from heaven and rescued me; he drew me out of deep waters.

17 He rescued me from my powerful enemies, from those who hated me and were
too strong for me.

18 They attacked me at a moment when I was in distress, but the Lord
supported me.

19 He led me to a place of safety; he rescued me because he delights in me. 

Today's Thoughts:

Do your troubles, like "deep waters" threaten to drown you?

David, in his weakness and helplessness knew that God alone 

had rescued him from his enemies when he was defenseless.



When you wish that God would rescue you from your troubles, 

remember that He can either deliver you or be your support as 

you go through them. Either way His protection is best for you.



When you feel like your drowning in your troubles, ask God to 

help you-hold you steady-and protect you. In His care, you are

never helpless.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, give me the faith to lean wholly on You. Strengthen 

my trust in Your grace, which is sufficient for my weakness, in

Jesus name. . . Amen.
