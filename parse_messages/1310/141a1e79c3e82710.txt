Today's Verses: Ps. 17:1-3

O Lord, hear my plea for justice. Listen to my cry for help. Pay attention
to my prayer, for it comes from honest lips.

f2 Declare me innocent, for you see those who do right. 
3 You have tested my thoughts and examined my heart in the night. You have
scrutinized me and found nothing wrong. 

I am determined not to sin in what I say. 

Today's Thoughts:

Was David saying he was sinless? Far be it-for a proud assumption of purity.

David's claim was an understanding of his relationship with God. In Psalm 32
and

51, David freely acknowledged his own sins. Nevertheless his relationship
with

God one of close fellowship and constant repentance and forgiveness.



His claim to goodness, therefore was based on his continual seeking after
God.

Let's always examine our own relationship with God does it result from
constant 

repentance resulting in the assurance of forgiveness? 



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, too often I have forgotten to thank You for every day
blessings.

I got up this morning and could walk-I opened my eyes and could see-I
reached for 

my food and could enjoy it. O Lord, many are Your blessings. Who could count
them all. . .Amen.

Watch and pray so that you do not 

fall into temptation. Mt. 26:41



There is a silly idea that good people don't know 

what temptation means. . .

(C. S Lewis)
