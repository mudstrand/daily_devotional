Today's Verses: Psalms 16:1-2 

Keep me safe, O God, for I have come to you for refuge. 
2 I said to the Lord, "You are my Master! Every good thing I have comes from
you." 

Today's Thoughts:

Do you have the confidence of David? Do you have confidence in God's
presence and guidance?

From birth to death, we are continually in God's grip. BUT what is even
better, we have hope in

the resurrection.



Even though our courage and strength may fail, we know that one day we will
be raised to a (New

Life) to serve Him forever. He is our security and we must cling to Him. . .


Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, You have called me out of darkness into Your marvelous light. Give
me the grace

to live as a child of light and an heir of heaven. I pray that all mankind
would be drawn to

Him who is the light of the world, Your Son, my Lord, Jesus Christ. . .Amen.
