Today's Verses: Psalms 16:6-8 

The land you have given me is a pleasant land. What a wonderful inheritance!

7 I will bless the Lord who guides me; even at night my heart instructs me.

8 I know the Lord is always with me. I will not be shaken, for He is right
beside me. 

Today's Thoughts:

It is human nature to make plans and then ask God to bless them-Instead we
should

seek God's will first. By communicating with God it allows Him to counsel us
and give

us wisdom. . .



Believers and unbelievers alike experience pain, trouble, and failure at
times (Mt. 5:45).

Unbelievers have a sense of hopelessness and confusion about life over their
purpose

on earth. Those who seek God however can move ahead, confident in knowing
what 

is right in God's eyes. . .



They know that God will keep them from straying off His chosen path. . . 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, I thank You, that Your Holy Spirit has guided me to make the

right decision concerning You, my God and Savior. I have been richly blessed

in the faith that You are my heavenly Father and that Jesus Christ is my
Savior.

For Jesus sake. . . Amen

Show me unfailing kindness like that of the Lord. . .

(I Samuel 20:14 NIV)



Kindness is a language which the deaf man can hear

and a blind man can see. . .(Mark Twain)
