Today's Verses: Psalms 16:4-5 

Troubles multiply for those who chase after other gods. I will not take part
in their sacrifices of blood or-

even speak the names of their gods. 
5 Lord, you alone are my inheritance, my cup of blessing. You guard all that
is mine. 

Today's Thoughts:

For what do you want to be remembered-or what do you want to pass on to your

children and friends? You can leave them no better advise than to hold on to
God 

and the memory of a person who did. . .



The verses here can be summarized in this-"Be faithful to the Lord your
God."

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, I humbly confess that I am often troubled by the problems of
life.

There are times that I don't know which way to turn. So I pray that You
would

enlighten me by Your Holy Spirit that I may recognize what Your will is in

every situation-give me the courage to decide every issue accordingly and

to leave the final outcome to Your direction. . .Amen.
