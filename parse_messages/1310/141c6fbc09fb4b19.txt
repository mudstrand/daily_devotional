Today's Verses: Psalms 17:13-14 (NLT)

Arise, O Lord! Stand against them, and bring them to their knees! Rescue me
from the wicked with your sword!

14 By the power of your hand, O Lord, destroy those who look to this world
for their reward. But satisfy the hunger 

of your treasured ones. May their children have plenty, leaving an
inheritance for their descendants. 

Today's Thoughts:

We truly deceive ourselves when we measure our happiness or contentment in
life by the amount of wealth

we possess. When we put riches at the top of our value system, we let
power, pleasure and financial security

overshadow the eternal value of our relationship with God. Many often think
they will be content when they 

get riches, only to discover they do not satisfy-and the pleasures fade
away.



The true measure of happiness or contentment is found in God's love and in
doing His will.

You will find true happiness if you put your relationship with God above
earthly riches. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your love and mercies which are new
every day.

I thank You that even though this world as so much to offer it can not come
pair to the 

riches I have in You. . . Amen.

Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

"I am the way and the truth and the life.

No one comes to the Father except through me." John 14:6



It is not the fact that a man has riches which keeps him from the kingdom of
heaven-

but the fact that riches have him. . . (J. Caird)
