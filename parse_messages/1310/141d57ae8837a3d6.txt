Today's Verses: Ps. 18:28-30

28 You light a lamp for me. The Lord, my God, lights up my darkness.

29 In your strength I can crush an army; with my God I can scale any wall. 
30 God's way is perfect. All the Lord's promises prove true. 

Today's Thoughts:

Some think that belief in God is a crutch for weak people who cannot make it
on their own.

Yes God is a shield to protect us when we are too weak to face certain
trials by ourselves.

But He does not want us to remain weak. He strengthens-protects-and guides
us in order 

to send us back into this evil world to fight for Him. And then He continues
to work with us, 

because the strongest person on earth is infinitely weaker than God and
needs His help.



David was not a coward; he was a mighty warrior who, even with all his
warriors knew that 

only God could protect him.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, Your knowledge and wisdom is beyond human understanding, You know
my 

every weakness-You know my every need-sustain me so that I will be able to
remain 

faithful during every trial. . . Amen
