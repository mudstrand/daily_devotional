Todays Verses: Ps. 20:1-3

1 In times of trouble, may the Lord answer your cry. May the name of the God
of Jacob keep you safe from all harm.

2 May he send you help from his sanctuary and strengthen you from Jerusalem.


3 May he remember all your gifts and look favorably on your burnt offerings.


Todays Thoughts:

God sees and knows the sincerity of our faith. Our prayers and generous
giving do not go unnoticed by God.

God answers the sincere prayers of those who seek Him by sending the right
person or right information at

the right time. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, I give thanks that you are an all knowing wise God.

Thank You Lord, that You do hear and know my prayers and answer them

according to Your wisdom. You know and understand my ability to handle

the things I ask for and give accordingly. . . Amen.
