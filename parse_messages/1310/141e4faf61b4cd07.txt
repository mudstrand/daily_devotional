Today's Verses: Ps. 32-34

32 God arms me with strength, and he makes my way perfect.

3 He makes me as surefooted as a deer, enabling me to stand on mountain
heights.

34 He trains my hands for battle; he strengthens my arm to draw a bronze
bow. 

Today's Thoughts:

God promises to give us strength to meet challenges-but He does not promise
to eliminate them.

If He gave us no rough roads to walk-no mountains to climb-and no battles to
fight-

we would not grow. He does not leave us alone with our challenges, BUT
instead, 

He stands beside us-teaches us-and strengthens us to face them. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, once again Your Word reminds me of Your faithfulness. Because of
Your 

promises I can face the challenges of life with the assurance that You will
stand beside 

me and give me the strength to face each one-thank You Lord. . . Amen.
