Today's Verse: Psalms 16:3 (NLT)

The godly people in the land are my true heroes! I take pleasure in them! 

Today's Thoughts:

When David says "The godly are his true heroes" he is actually saying he
would 

choose as models and friends those who were godly and truthful. . .



Our friends and associates can have a profound influence on our life.-

Make sure to keep your eyes on those who are faithful to God and His Word. .
.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for my Christian friends. Continue to

strengthen my faith and trust in You that I may become a godly hero to

some-one today. . .Amen.

Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

God has not called us to see through each other-

But to see each other through.



Carry each other's burdens, and in this way

You will fulfill the Law of Christ. . . Gal. 6:2 NIV
