Today's Verse: Ps. 15:5

Those who lend money without charging interest, and who cannot be bribed to
lie about the innocent. 

Such people will stand firm forever. 

Today's Thoughts:

God was against the Jews charging interest or making a profit on loans to
the needy

(Ex. 22:25; Lev. 25:35-37) but charging interest on loans to foreigners was
allowed 

(Deut. 23:20).



Some people are so obsessed with money that they will change their God-given


standards and life-style to get it. If money has a controlling force in your
life, it

must be curbed, or it will harm others and destroy your relationship with
God. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, help me to be what You want me to be, and when I fail forgive me

for Jesus sake. Let Your daily pardon strengthen my daily perseverance to
love

You and my neighbor. .Amen.
