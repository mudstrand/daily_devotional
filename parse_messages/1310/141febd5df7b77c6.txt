Today's Verses: Ps. 19:12, 13

12 How can I know all the sins lurking in my heart? Cleanse me from these
hidden faults.

13 Keep your servant from deliberate sins! Don't let them control me. Then I
will be free

of guilt and innocent of great sin. 

Today's Thoughts:

May Christians are often plagued with guilt. They worry that they may have
committed a sin 

unknowingly-or have done something good with selfish intentions-or failed to
put their whole 

heart into a task-or have neglected what they should have done- Guilt can
play an important 

part in bringing us to Christ and keeping us behaving properly-but it should
not cripple us or 

make us fearful. . . .

God fully and completely forgives us-even for those sins we have done
unknowingly. . .

Today's Prayer suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, I have sinned, I have been discouraged, I have given
way 

to needless worries, I have questioned Your promises, I have had a doubtful
mind.

I confess all these and other shortcomings and ask You to receive me and
blot out 

all my transgression against you and my neighbor. Create in me a clean and
pure 

heart and a greater faith. . . Amen.
