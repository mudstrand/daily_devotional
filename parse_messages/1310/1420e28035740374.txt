Today's Verses: Ps. 20:4-5 (NLT)

4 May he grant your heart's desires and make all your plans succeed

5 May we shout for joy when we hear of your victory and raise a victory 

banner in the name of our God. May the Lord answer all your prayers. 

Today's Thoughts:

Although we are not in a position to barter with God, He may still choose 

to answer a prayer that has a promise. When you pray ask yourself, 'will 

I follow through on any promises I make to God if He grants my request?'



It is dangerous to ignore a promise, especially to God. 

God keeps His promises, and He expects you to keep yours. . .

Todays suggested Prayer:

O Lord, I thank You and praise Your Holy Name! Help me to be faithful 

in keeping my promises to You. Forgive me for my memory lapses I pray 

in Jesus name. . . Amen. 



Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

Yesterday, today forever, Jesus is the same; all may change,

But Jesus never, Glory to His Name. . .
