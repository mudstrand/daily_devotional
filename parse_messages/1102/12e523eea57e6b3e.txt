02/23/2011~~~food for thought~~~TRUE LOVE HAS NO FEAR

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, 
because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears 
is not made perfect in love." - 1 John 4:18 

Our Lesson for Today:
"No fear in love," ~ We need to realize that "love" real love, is the
work and will of God and the fruit of faith in God for the salvation of
every human. So in this there should be no fear. . .

"perfect love casts out fear." ~ Jesus is God's perfect love that has 
come to speak and to save, not to condemn. God's love reaches its 
goal, that is, love is perfected in us when we believe in Jesus and no 
longer fear that God might still be angry with us because of our sins. . .

Remember that as long as a person gives himself up to fear of God's 
punishment, he is not relying on God's Son completely for His salvation.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, I have not always loved my fellow Christian 
as I should. Forgive me and work Your love in me to cast out my 
fear of punishment. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
