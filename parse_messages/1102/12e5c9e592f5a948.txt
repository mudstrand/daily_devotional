02/25/2011~~~food for thought~~~PUT YOUR PLANS IN THE NAIL SCARED HANDS

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"For I know the plans I have for you," declares the LORD, "plans to prosper 
you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will 
call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me 
and find me when you seek me with all your heart." - Jeremiah 29:11-13 

Our Lesson for Today:
This was a letter written to the people which had been exiled because of sin.
But with God there is indeed a future hope in God's plans even for an exiled
people. . .

However, after many years would God's chastisement produce the desired change 
in their lives. When they finally turned again to the Lord with all their heart, He would
keep His promise to bring them back to their homeland. . .

There is an important lesson we can learn from this text ~ if we are willing to be taught.
There is a judgement awaiting all who are unwilling to follow God's plans for our lives,
but if we turn from our sins and call upon the Lord with all our heart. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
O Lord, fulfill Your plans in me, and guide me to make plans that
agree with Your will.Teach me to trust Your decisions for my life,
through Jesus Christ. . . Amen

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
