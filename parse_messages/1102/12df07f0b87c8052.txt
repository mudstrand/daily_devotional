Thank U. M.G.

This made me cry too.

> Every Sunday afternoon, after the morning service at the church, the Pastor

> and his eleven year old son would go out into their town and hand out Gospel

> Tracts.

>

> This particular Sunday afternoon, as it came time for the Pastor and his son

> to go to the streets with their tracts, it was very cold outside, as well as

> pouring rain.

>

> The boy bundled up in his warmest and driest clothes and said, 'OK, dad, I'm

> ready.'

>

> His Pastor dad asked, 'Ready for what?'

>

> 'Dad, it's time we gather our tracts together and go out.'

>

> Dad responds, 'Son, it's very cold outside and it's pouring rain.'

>

> The boy gives his dad a surprised look, asking, 'But Dad, aren't people

> still going to Hell, even though it's raining?'

>

> Dad answers, 'Son, I am not going out in this weather.'

>

> Despondently, the boy asks, 'Dad, can I go? Please?'

>

> His father hesitated for a moment then said, 'Son, you can go. Here are the

> tracts, be careful son..'

>

> 'Thanks Dad!'

>

> And with that, he was off and out into the rain. This eleven year old boy

> walked the streets of the town going door to door and handing everybody he

> met in the street a Gospel Tract .

>

> After two hours of walking in the rain, he was soaking, bone-chilled wet and

> down to his VERY LAST TRACT. He stopped on a corner and looked for someone

> to hand a tract to, but the streets were totally deserted.

>

> Then he turned toward the first home he saw and started up the sidewalk to

> the front door and rang the door bell. He rang the bell, but nobody

> answered.

>

> He rang it again and again, but still no one answered. He waited but still

> no answer.

>

> Finally, this eleven year old trooper turned to leave, but something stopped

> him.

>

> Again, he turned to the door and rang the bell and knocked loudly on the

> door with his fist. He waited, something holding him there on the front

> porch!

>

> He rang again and this time the door slowly opened.

>

> Standing in the doorway was a very sad-looking elderly lady. She softly

> asked, 'What can I do for you, son?' With radiant eyes and a smile that lit

> up her world, this little boy said, 'Ma'am, I'm sorry if I disturbed you,

> but I just want to tell you that * JESUS REALLY DOES LOVE YOU * and I came

> to give you my very last Gospel Tract which will tell you all about JESUS

> and His great LOVE.'

>

> With that, he handed her his last tract and turned to leave..

>

> She called to him as he departed. 'Thank you, son! And God Bless You!'

>

> Well, the following Sunday morning in church Pastor Dad was in the pulpit.

> As the service began, he asked, 'Does anybody have testimony or want to say

> anything?'

>

> Slowly, in the back row of the church, an elderly lady stood to her feet.

>

> As she began to speak, a look of glorious radiance came from her face, 'No

> one in this church knows me. I've never been here before. You see, before

> last Sunday I was not a Christian. My husband passed on some time ago,

> leaving me totally alone in this world. Last Sunday, being a particularly

> cold and rainy day, it was even more so in my heart that I came to the end

> of the line where I no longer had any hope or will to live.

>

> So I took a rope and a chair and ascended the stairway into the attic of my

> home. I fastened the rope securely to a rafter in the roof, then stood on

> the chair and fastened the other end of the rope around my neck. Standing on

> that chair, so lonely and broken-hearted I was about to leap off, when

> suddenly the loud ringing of my doorbell downstairs startled me. I thought,

> 'I'll wait a minute, and whoever it is will go away.'

>

> I waited and waited, but the ringing doorbell seemed to get louder and more

> insistent, and then the person ringing also started knocking loudly...

>

> I thought to myself again, 'Who on earth could this be? Nobody ever rings my

> bell or comes to see me.' I loosened the rope from my neck and started for

> the front door, all the while the bell rang louder and louder.

>

> When I opened the door and looked I could hardly believe my eyes, for there

> on my front porch was the most radiant and angelic little boy I had ever

> seen in my life. His SMILE, oh, I could never describe it to you!

>

> The words that came from his mouth caused my heart that had long been dead,

> TO LEAP TO LIFE as he exclaimed with a cherub-like voice, 'Ma'am, I just

> came to tell you that JESUS REALLY DOES LOVE YOU .' Then he gave me this

> Gospel Tract that I now hold in my hand.

>

> As the little angel disappeared back out into the cold and rain, I closed my

> door and read slowly every word of this Gospel Tract. Then I went up to my

> attic to get my rope and chair. I wouldn't be needing them any more.

>

> You see-- -I am now a Happy Child of the KING. Since the address of your

> church was on the back of this Gospel Tract, I have come here to personally

> say THANK YOU to God's little angel who came just in the nick of time and by

> so doing, spared my soul from an eternity in hell..'

>

> There was not a dry eye in the church. And as shouts of praise and honor to

> THE KING resounded off the very rafters of the building, Pastor Dad

> descended from the pulpit to the front pew where the little angel was

> seated....

>

> He took his son in his arms and sobbed uncontrollably.

>

> Probably no church has had a more glorious moment, and probably this

> universe has never seen a Papa that was more filled with love & honour for

> his son... Except for One..

>

> Blessed are your eyes for reading this message.

>

> Don 't let this message die, read it again and pass it to others.

> Matthew 10:32 says:

> Father in heaven.'

>
