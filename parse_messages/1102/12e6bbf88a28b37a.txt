02/28/2011~~~food for thought~~~JESUS LOVES US, LOVE LIKE WISE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but 
with actions and in truth." - 1 John 3:18 

Our Lesson for Today:
"Love" is prompted and proceeds from the truth and is carried out in
actual deeds done for the benefits and blessings of another. Whatever
tends to our brother's salvation is done "in truth."

Luth: "To love a brother who is kind and pleasant in return ~ is a trivial
matter. This is the way the world also loves. 'The crowd judges friendships
by their usefulness.' Accordingly, John does not say: 'Let us love those
who are saintly, agreeable, and rich.'

No, he says; 'Let us love the brethren, in such a way that nothing but the 
brotherhood is loved and regarded; for a brother is loved out a sense of 
duty, not because of usefulness and not because of praise. All the gifts 
we have should serve those who do not have them.

For example, he who is learned should serve him who is not learned; He
who is rich should serve him who is poor; he who is sensible should serve 
him who is foolish. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive my lack of real love for my
brothers and sisters, and enable me to love everyone
as Jesus has loved me. . .Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
