02/20/2011~~~food for thought~~~LOVE BEYOND UNDERSTANDING

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 
No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and 
his love is made complete in us." - 1 John 4:11-12

Our Lesson for Today: 
What kind of love is this? ~ ~ ~ Despite all our selfishness and sinfulness He
has loved us. In (1 Jn 3:1) we are even called His own children. God's love is
unique because it is not what our corrupt, sinful nature deserves; it is not
what our thoughts, words, and deeds have earned.

God has even promises that He has made us His children. ~ Despite the lies,
deceptions, and partial truths of the world, God has never lied to us, and He
has never failed to do what He has promised. ~ You can count on Him.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive my lack of real love for my brothers and sisters
in Christ, and enable me to love everyone as Jesus has loved me. . .Amen
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
