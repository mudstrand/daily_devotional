02/03/2011~~~food for thought~~~GOD HAS PREPARED ALL THINGS

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"However, as it is written: "What no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, 
and what no human mind has conceived"- the things God has prepared for 
those who love him-" - 1 Corinthians 2:9 

Our Lesson for Today:
There are a couple of verses that I want to share with you that are of the utmost 
importance as a follow up to (1 Cor. 2:9). 

First, (Jm. 1:12) Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, 
for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, 
which God has promised to those who love Him. . .

Second, (Mt. 25:34) Then the King will say to those one His right, Come, you who 
are blessed by My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world. . .

Third, (Isa. 64:4) From of old no one has heard or perceived by the ear, no eye 
has seen a God besides you, who acts for those who wait for him. . .

The Spirit reveals God's mysteries through the Gospel, even though the words
Paul writes, "depths of God". . . There will always be mysteries about God's 
person and nature, but we are given a glimpse of His ways through the cross. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I thank you for revealing Yourself to me by Your cross. 
Receive this weak sinner and strengthen me for Your service. . .

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
