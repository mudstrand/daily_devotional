02/19/2011~~~food for thought~~~NOTHING CAN SEPARATE US FROM THE LOVE OF CHRIST

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, 
neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, 
nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of 
God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord." - Romans 8:38-39 

Our Lesson for Today:
We have here a tenfold inventory of superhuman realities that threaten, in vain,
to break the grip of Christ's love. These unseen cosmic forces, even though 
created by God, they now stand in opposition to God's eternal purpose because
of the fall. . .

They even threaten to separate us from Christ's love, but Christ has triumphed 
over them. Christ's death, resurrection, and exaltation at God's right hand
guarantees victory over anything and everything that would separate us from His 
love. . .

When following Christ brings distress, we sometimes distance ourselves from Him.
But Christ never draws back from us. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, though You are exalted at the Father's right hand,
You still hold us near. Keep us in Your love to the end. . .Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
