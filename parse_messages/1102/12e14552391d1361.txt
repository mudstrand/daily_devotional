Our Bible Verses for Today:
"If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, 
I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift 
of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I 
have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. 
If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that 
I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing." - 1 Corinthians 13:1-3 

Our Lesson for Today:
Why has Paul made such a big thing about [Love] in this chapter?
Because love is a self-giving, sacrificial concern for others. The word
was esp. adopted by Christians; it characterizes God and is the basis
of His actions toward us in Christ. . .

Those loved by God show love toward others. The weight of Paul's teaching 
about justification has obscured how frequently He emphasizes love in this 
chapter. He uses the term more often than even the apostle John in I Jn.

Suggested Prayer:
Dear all knowing Father, when my Christian brothers and sisters disappoint
and annoy me, help me to stretch out my arms and embrace them with Your 
all-embracing love through Jesus, our mutual Savior. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
