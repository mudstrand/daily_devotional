Subject: Fw: The Living Bible

Now, this is the Living Bible:


His name is Tim. He has wild hair, wears
a T-shirt with holes in it, jeans, and no shoes. This was literally
his wardrobe for his entire four years of college.

He is brilliant. Kind of profound and
very, very bright. He became a Christian while attending college.

Across the street from the campus is a
well-dressed, very conservative church. They want to develop a
ministry to the students, but are not sure how to go about it.

One day Tim decides to go there. He walks
in with jeans, no shoes, his T-shirt, and wild hair. The service has
already started, so Tim starts down the aisle looking for a seat.

The church is completely packed and he
can't find a seat. By now, people are really looking a bit
uncomfortable, but no one says anything. Tim gets closer and closer
and closer to the pulpit and, when he realizes there are no seats, he
just squats down right on the carpet.

By now the people are really uptight, and
the tension in the air is thick.

About this time, the minister realizes
that from way at the back of the church, a deacon is slowly making
his way toward Tim. Now the deacon is in his eighties, has
silver-gray hair, and a three-piece suit --a godly man, very
elegant, very dignified, very courtly. He walks with a cane and, as he
starts walking toward this boy, everyone is saying to themselves that
you can't blame him for what he's going to do.

How can you expect a man of his age and
of his background to understand some college kid on the floor?

It takes a long time for the man to reach the boy.

The church is utterly silent except for
the clicking of the man's cane. All eyes are focused on him. You
can't even hear anyone breathing. The minister can't even preach the
sermon until the deacon does what he has to do.

Then, they see this elderly man drop his
cane on the floor. With great difficulty, he lowers himself and sits
down next to Tim and worships with him so he won't be alone.

Everyone chokes up with emotion...

When the minister gains control, he says,

"What I'm about to preach, you will never
remember. What you have just seen, you will never forget."

Be careful how you live. You may be the
only Bible some people will ever read!

I asked the Lord to bless as I prayed for you today,

To guide you and protect you
As you go along your way...
His love is always with you,
His promises are true,
And when we give Him all our cares,
You know He will see us through.


~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Only if you feel led to do so, pass this to
people you want God to bless.

I DID!
