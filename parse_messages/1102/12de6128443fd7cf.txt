Our Bible Verses for Today:
"Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. Love the LORD 
your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength." - Deuteronomy 6:4-5 

Our Lesson for Today:
The key to a Christ-like life is: Love. . .with all. God's command is that we love Him
above all else. This law was given in the very beginning to Adam and Eve in paradise.
If they had loved the Lord their God, they would not have transgressed His precept. . .

God's desire is that His people love Him with total sincerity, without reservation, and
with all their faculties. Yes, we should give to God the most precious thing we have, 
that is, our mind, for we have nothing better than that. . .

When we have paid our debt to our Creator, then we may labor for men, to show them
kindness, and to give help. The corrupt nature in us can not produce this perfect
obedience. Doubts concerning both the anger and mercy of God cling in our heart. . .

No one fears God as he ought. No one is so on fire with love as he ought to be.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, we thank you for parents, relatives, friends, and pastors 
who seek Your Word in purity and truth. Use us [me] now as an instrument 
for the salvation of others. . . Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
