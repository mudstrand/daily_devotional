02/10/2011~~~food for thought~~~PERSEVERANCE IN THE TIME OF TRIALS

Our Bible Verse for Today:
2 Thessalonians 1:3-4 

Thanksgiving and Prayer
3 We ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters, and rightly so, 
because your faith is growing more and more, and the love all of you have for 
one another is increasing. 
4 Therefore, among God's churches we boast about your perseverance and 
faith in all the persecutions and trials you are enduring. 

Our Lesson for Today:
Paul gives thanks for God's grace at work among the Thessalonians, by which
God has created faith and love in them.Paul points to the persecuted Thessalonians
as examples for other Christians of their time and ours. . .

We, too, should "be imitators of God" (Eph. 5:1). ~ We must set an example to others 
in what we believe and in what we say and do for them; by living in faith and in love. . .

Christ is in deed our example, but, much greater and higher than that, He is our Savior.
He suffered in our place, on account of our sins, for us!

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I beg of You that You would strengthen me each time
I partake of Your Super in faith toward You and in fervent love
toward one another. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
