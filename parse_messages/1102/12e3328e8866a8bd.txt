02/17/2011~~~food for thought~~~THE OLD HAS BECOME NEW

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"For this is the message you heard from the beginning: 
We should love one another." - 1 John 3:11 

Our Lesson for Today:
"No new commandment" ~ but yet ~ "A new commandment"
Our Lord's love for us has made the old commandment to
"love your neighbor" new and powerful. . .

This Commandment is true in Jesus and in those who believe in Him ~ 
"The beloved child, born of God," loves his brother because the 
love of Christ is at work in him. . .

As the darkness passes, it does so in the light of His Gospel which shines 
through His Word and Sacrament to a world lost in darkness of this old age. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, grant it that I may trust in you and Your love that I may
always love my neighbor. . . Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather
The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
