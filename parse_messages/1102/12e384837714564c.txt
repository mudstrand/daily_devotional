Our Bible Verses for Today:
"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution 
or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? No, in all these things we are more than 
conquerors through Him who loved us." - Romans 8:35,37 

Our Lesson for Today:
Paul lists seven things that threaten to come between us and Christ's love, all of which 
Paul experienced so He answers the question himself with a definite "NO."

How is it possible Paul also gives the answer here too: We are conquerors through
Him who loved us. . .

By His death on the cross Christ gained total victory for us. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, though You are exalted at the Father's right hand, 
You still hold us. Keep us in Your Love to the end. . . Amen

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
