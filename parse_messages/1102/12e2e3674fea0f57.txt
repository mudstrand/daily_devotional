Dear M.J. I have forwarded this to all my Devotional friends (about 50)























A small request 

This year has been one with too many diagnoses too close to home. For all the friends, family, loved ones, and those we don't even know... 






Friday is world cancer day - I'd appreciate it if you will forward this request 
93% won't forward 
A small request.. Just one line. 
Dear God, I pray for a cure for cancer. In Jesus Name! ~Amen~

All you are asked to do is keep this circulating, even if it's only to one more person. 
In memory of anyone you know who has been struck down by cancer or is still living with it. 
A Candle Loses Nothing by Lighting Another Candle.. 
Please Keep This Candle Going
