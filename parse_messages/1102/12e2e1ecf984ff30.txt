Our Bible Verse for Today:
"This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent 
his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins." - 1 John 4:10 

The Lesson to be learned:
The thing to remember here is, we are not saved by our love for God
but by the love of God for us in sending Christ to be the atoning sacrifice
for our sins. . .

Luther once said, "Provide yourselves with armor from Scripture concerning 
justification which takes place through faith. If you put your reliance on these
passages, you will be able to stand even after a fall. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, I confess that I have not always loved as I should.
Forgive me and work Your love in me and cast out all my doubts. . .Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
