Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Do not those who plot evil go astray? But those who plan 
what is good find love and faithfulness." - Proverbs 14:22 

Our Lesson for Today:
The material blessings enjoyed by families should be pursued by 
prudent and diligent work done honestly. God blesses such labor 
and uses it to provide for the needs of His people. . .

We should be careful to not forget that it is God who provides us 
with all that we need to support our body and life. We should also 
never resort to wickedness or dishonesty in an attempt to secure 
a better life for ourselves. . .

The righteousness that comes through faith in Jesus not only delivers 
from death, but it also ensures that our Heavenly Father will provide us 
with everything we need. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, grant me the ability to believe that
because You did not spare Your own Son, You will now 
graciously give me every needed thing. . . Amen 
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
