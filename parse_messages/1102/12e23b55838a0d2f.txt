02/14/2011~~~food for thought~~~HAPPY VALENTINES DAY

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, 
that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." - John 3:16 

Our Lesson for Today:
Wow! ~ What a valentine present! ~ actually two presents. # 1 God gave His only 
Son as a sacrificial gift to deliver the world from condemnation and # 2 to give eternal 
life to those who believe in Him. . .

When we continue in an immoral lifestyle, we naturally resist His divine disclosure
of our sin and thus our need for a Savior. Let us not flee the light, but repent.
God has revealed His strong love in His Son, Jesus Christ, to forgive your sins
and give you life. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, grant that my life may be a vivid 
testimony to Your sacrificial and faithful love in Christ. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
