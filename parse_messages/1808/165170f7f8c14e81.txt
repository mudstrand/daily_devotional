VERSE FOR TODAY:

_Disregarding another person's faults preserves love;_

_telling about them separates close friends._ (Pro. 17:9)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

This proverb is saying that we should be willing to

disregard the faults of others. Covering over offenses is

necessary to any relationship. It is tempting, especially

in an argument, to bring up all the mistakes the other

person has ever made. We should be careful to try not

to bring anything into an argument that is unrelated to

the topic being discussed. As we grow to be more like

Christ, we will acquire God's ability to forget confessed

sins of the past.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Lord, I pray that I would have a more forgiving heart,

so that I would become more Christ like each day. . . Amen.
