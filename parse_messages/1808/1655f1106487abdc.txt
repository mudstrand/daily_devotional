VERSE FOR TODAY:

_Mockers will be punished, and the backs of fools will be beaten._

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

Wrong assumptions lead to wrong conclusions. We should not

take our limited experiences and jump to conclusions about life

in general. If you find yourself doubting God, remember that you

do not have all the facts. God wants only the very best for your

life. Many people endure great pain, but ultimately they find some

greater good from it. When you're struggling, don't assume the worst.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Lord, I pray that You will forgive me when I jump to conclusions

about people and different situations in life. I pray that I will
always

trust in Your advise. . . Amen.
