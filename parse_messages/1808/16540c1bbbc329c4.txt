VERSE FOR TODAY:

_A false witness will not go unpunished, nor will a liar_

_escape. _(Pro. 19:5)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

Making up false stories is strictly forbidden by the Lord.

Gossip, slander, and false witnessing undermines families,

strains neighborhood cooperation, and causes chaos of a

justice system. Yes destructive gossip will always cause

problems. Even if you do not initiate a lie, you become

responsible if you pass it along. The best advice is don't

circulate rumors; squelch them before they get started.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

I thank You Lord, for the many blessings You have given

since the creation of the world, even though we are far from

deserving of even one. I pray that You would open the eyes of

us all so that we may turn our lives back over to You. Help

us to be faithful I pray in Jesus name. . . Amen.
