HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~The best is yet to come, just be ready to receive it...

Our Meditation for Today:

Let us draw near to God with a sincere heart in full assurance
of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty
conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water...

Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for He who 
promised is faithful...

And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward
love and good deeds...(Heb. 10:22-24) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

If we truly stop and think about it, we have significant privileges
associated with our new life in Christ:

(1) We have personal access to God through Christ and can draw 
near to Him without an elaborate system (Heb. 10:22).

(2) We may grow in faith, overcome doubts and questions, and
deepen our relationship with God (Heb. 10:23).

(3) We may enjoy encouragement from one another (Heb. 10:24).

(4) We may worship together (Heb. 10:25).

Let us not over-look or forsake these privileges...

Our Prayer for Today:
I thank You Lord, for the personal relationship that has become
ours through Jesus Christ. I thank You for the relationship which
becomes more personal through faith. I thank You for the fellowship
of other believers...I Thank You for the fellowship that is ours even
through e-mail...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
