HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Most of the stuff people worry about ain't never 
gonna happen, anyway...

Our Meditation for Today:

By faith Moses parents hid him for three months after he was 
born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were 
not afraid of the King's edict...(Heb. 11:23)

Our Thought for Today:

Moses' parents trusted God to protect their son's life.
They were not merely proud parents; they were believers
who had faith that God would care for him...

As a parent, have you trusted God enough to take care
of your children?

God has a plan for every person, and your important task 
is to pray for your children and prepare them to do the work 
God has planned for them to do...

Faith allows us to entrust even our children to God...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, there is so much that I have learned
from Old Testament people about faith and the importance
of having a real faith in You. I know that it is important that
I have this kind of faith that I might fulfill Your will in my life.
I thank You that I can sleep feeling that my children ans well
as my wife and myself are also safe...Amen.

Keep looking up with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
