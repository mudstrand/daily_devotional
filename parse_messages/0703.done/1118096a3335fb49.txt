HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Do not corner something you know is meaner than you...

Our Meditation for Today:

By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen,
in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith
he condemned the world and became heir of the right-
eousness that comes by faith...(Heb. 11:7) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Noah experienced rejection because He was different from 
his neighbors...

God commanded Noah to build a large boat in the middle of
dry land, and although God's command seemed foolish, Noah
obeyed...

Noah's obedience made him appear strange to his neighbors,
just as the new beliefs of the Jewish Christians undoubtedly
made them stand out...

As you obey God, don't be surprised if others regard you as
"different." Your obedience makes their disobedience stand 
out...

Remember, if God asks you to do something, He will give you
the necessary strength to carry out that task...

Our Prayer for Today;
Dear Lord, I pray that I would always be found faithful, 
following Your commands. May I always be a Christ-
like example to my peers. Bless my e-mail friends with
good health and safety...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
