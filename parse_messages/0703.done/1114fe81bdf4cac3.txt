HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~No matter how you feel, get up, dress up and show up...

Our Meditation for Today:

Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit
of doing, but let us encourage one another, and all the more
as you see the Day approaching...(Heb. 10:25) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

To neglect Christian meetings is to give up the encouragement
and help of other Christians. We should gather together to share
our faith and to strengthen one another in the Lord...

As we get closer to the Day when Christ will return, we will face
many spiritual struggles, and even times of persecution...

Anti-Christian forces will grow in strength. But difficulties should
never be an excuses for missing Church service. Rather, as 
difficulties arise, we should make an even greater effort to be
faithful in attendance...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the fellowship and the
strength I receive from other believers as we meet together.
I thank You for the oneness that comes from other Christians
as we come together. I thank You for Your grace and mercy...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
