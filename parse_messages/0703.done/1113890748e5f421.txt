HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Envy is a waste of time. You already have all you need...

Our Meditation for Today:

This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, 
says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will
write them on their minds...

Then He adds: Their sins and lawless acts I will remember 
no more." (Heb. 10:16, 17) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

The writer concludes his argument with this powerful statement
that God will remember our sins no more...

Christ forgives completely, so there is no need to confess our 
past sins repeatedly. As Believers, we can be confident that the 
sins we confess and renounce are forgiven and forgotten...

Our Prayer for Today:
I thank You Lord, for the assurance that once confessed my 
sins are forgive and forgotten. I now ask for forgiveness of
my sins of though word and deed that I have committed today.
I ask that You lay your hand of protection and good health upon 
all my e-mail friends...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
