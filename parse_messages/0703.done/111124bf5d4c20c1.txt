HAVE A GREAT DAY!!!~~~(food for thought )~~~Your children get only one childhood--make it memorable...

Our Meditation for Today:

The law requires that nearly everything be cleansed
with blood, and without the shedding of blood there
is no forgiveness...(Heb. 9:22) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Why does forgiveness require the shedding of blood?

This is no arbitrary decree on the part of a blood-thirsty God
as some have suggested. There is no greater symbol of life
than blood, blood keeps us alive...

Jesus shed His blood--gave His life--for our sins so that we
wouldn't have to experience spiritual death, eternal separation
from God...

Jesus is the source of life, not death. He gave His own life to
pay our penalty for us so that we might live. After shedding His
blood for us, Christ rose from the grave and proclaimed victory 
over sin and death...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your Word today, I thank You
for the reminder that it is not anything that I have done that warrants 
eternal life, but that it is nothing but the blood of Christ that guarantees
that my sins have been washed away...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
