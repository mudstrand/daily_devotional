HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~If we all threw our problems in a pile and saw everyone else's,
We'd hurry and grab ours back...

Our Meditation for Today:

The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming--
not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by
the same sacrifice repeated endlessly year after year, make
perfect those who draw near to worship.

If it could, would they not have stopped being offered? For
the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and
would no longer have felt guilty for their sins...

But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins--(Heb. 10:1-3) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

When people gathered for the offering of sacrifice on the Day of Atonement,
they were reminded of their sins, and they undoubtedly felt guilty all over again.

What they needed most was forgiveness--the permanent, powerful, sin-destroying 
forgiveness we have from Christ. When we confess a sin to Him, we need never 
think of it again...

Christ has forgiven us, and the sin no longer exists. (see I Jn. 1:9).

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the permanent, 
powerful, sin-destroying forgiveness we have from Christ.
I thank You for washing all my guilt away...Bless and keep
each of my e-mail friends safe and healthy...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
