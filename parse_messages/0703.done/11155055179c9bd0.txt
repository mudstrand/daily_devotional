HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Take a deep breath. It calms the mind...

Our Meditation for Today:

If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have 
received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice
for sins is left...(Heb. 10:26) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

When people deliberately reject Christ's offer of salvation,
they reject God's most precious gift. They ignore the leading 
of the Holy Spirit, the one who communicates to us God's 
saving love...

This warning was given to Jewish Christians who were tempted
to reject Christ for Judaism, but it applies to anyone who rejects 
Christ for another religion, OR, having understood Christ's atoning 
work, deliberately turns away from it...

The point is there is no other acceptable sacrifice for sin than the 
death of Christ on the cross. If someone deliberately rejects the 
sacrifice of Christ after clearly understanding the Good News
teaching about it, then there is no way for that person to be saved,
because God has not provided any other name in all of heaven for 
the people to call on to save them (Acts 4:12).

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, I thank You for the atoning work of Christ.
I thank You for the Good News of salvation. Thy Word 
is a lamp onto my feet and a light onto my path...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
