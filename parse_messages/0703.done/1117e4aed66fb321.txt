HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Forgive your enemies. It messes up their heads

Our Meditation for Today:

Without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone 
who comes to Him must believe that He exists and that He
rewards those who earnestly seek Him...(Heb. 11:6) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Believing that God exists is only the beginning; even the demons
believe that much (Jm. 2:19, 20)...

God will not settle for mere acknowledgement of His existence.
He wants a personal, dynamic relationship with you that will
transform your life...

Those who seek God will find that they are rewarded with His
intimate presence...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your love and wanting to have
a personal relationship with Your people...I thank You for the power
that relationship has in my life...To know You (that personal relationship)
is to love You...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
