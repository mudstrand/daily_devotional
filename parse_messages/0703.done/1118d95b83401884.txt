HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(Food for thought)~~~It don't take a very big person to carry a grudge...

Our Meditation for Today:

By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would
later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even
though he did not know where he was going...

By faith he made his home in the promised land like a
stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did 
Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same 
promise...

For he was looking forward to the city with foundations
whose architect and builder is God...(Heb. 11:8-10) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Abraham's life was filled with faith. At God's command, he
left home and went to another land, obeying with out question.
(Gen. 12:1ff)...

He believed the covenant that God made with him. In obedience
to God, Abraham was even willing to sacrifice his son Isaac (Gen.
22:1-19)...

Do not be surprised if God asks you to give up secure, familiar
surroundings in order to carry out His will...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, create in me a faith like Abraham.
Create in me a sensitivity to Your Holy Spirit so that I would 
faithfully follow Your will for me. Bless and protect our troops.
Comfort the families who have lost loved ones because of this
war... Amen. 

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
