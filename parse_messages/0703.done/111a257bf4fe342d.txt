HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~The best sermons are lived, not preached...

Our Meditation for Today:

By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about 
the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave 
instructions about his bones...(Heb. 11:22) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Joseph, one of Jacob's sons, was sold into slavery by his
jealous brothers (Gen. 37). Eventually, Joseph was sold
again, this time to an official of the Pharaoh of Egypt...

Because of Joseph's faithfulness to God, he was given the
top-ranking position in Egypt. Although Joseph could have 
used that position to build a personal empire, he remembered 
God's promise to Abraham...

After he had been reconciled to his brother, Joseph brought
his family to be near him and requested that his bones be taken
to the Promised Land when the Jews eventually left Egypt...

Our lesson is that, faith means trusting God and doing what He
wants, regardless of the circumstances or consequences...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for the lesson that I have 
learned today from the life of Joseph. Help me to remain 
faithful to You regardless of circumstances or consequences...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
