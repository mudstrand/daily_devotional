HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Every path has a few puddles...

Our Meditation for Today:

By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac
as a sacrifice. He who had received the promise was
about to sacrifice his one and only son,

even though God had said to him, "It is through Isaac 
that your offspring will be reckoned."

Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead, and 
figuratively speaking, he did receive Isaac back from death...
(Heb. 11:17-19) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Abraham was willing to give up his son when God commanded him
to do so (Gen. 22:1-19).

God did not let Abraham take Isaac's life, because God had given 
the command in order to test Abraham's faith. Instead of taking 
Abraham's son, God gave Abraham a whole nation of descendents
through Isaac...

If you are afraid to trust God with the possession, dream, or person you 
treasure most, pay attention to Abraham's example... Because Abraham 
was willing to give up everything for God, he received back more than 
he could have imagined...

However, what we receive, is not always immediate or in the form of 
material possessions. Material things should be among the least 
satisfying of rewards. Our best and greatest rewards await us in 
eternity...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the great example
that we have in Abraham. I pray that my faith would one
day become like his. I do confess that I fall way short of
the faith that I should have. forgive me for this I pray...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
