05/27/09~~~food for thought~~~Always live in the consciousness of being one with Christ...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

"With all prayer and supplication, praying at all seasons in
the Spirit, and watching thereunto in all perseverance and
supplication for all the saints and on my behalf." (Eph, 6:18-17) R.V.

Our Lesson for Today:

I think that Paul had a deep sense of divine unity of the whole body of Christ
and of the actual need of unceasing prayer for all the members of the body
by all who belong to it...

AND He did not mean this to be an occasional thing, but the unceasing exercise
of a life long union in which we are bound together, should be evident from the words
he uses, "with all prayer and supplication, praying at all seasons in the spirit and 
watching thereunto, in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints."

He expects believers to be filled with the consciousness of the being in Christ
and through Him united consciously to the whole body, that in our daily life and
all its engagements, our highest aim would always be the welfare of the body of
Christ of which we are members...

So as children of God let us live for Christ our King...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, help me to live in a willingness of sacrifice of 
prayer and intercession at all times and for all saints! Amen.
