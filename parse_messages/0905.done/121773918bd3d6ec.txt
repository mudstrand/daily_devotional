the ambition to be well-to-do...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit,
because He maketh intercession for the saints according to the Will
of God." (Ro 8:27)

Our Lesson for Today:

What a light these words cast upon the life of prayer in the hearts
of Christians. We know not what we should pray for or as we ought...

How often this hinders our prayer or hinders the faith that is essential
to its success. But here for our encouragement we are told, that the 
Holy Spirit "maketh intercession" for us with groanings that cannot be 
uttered...

"He maketh intercession for the saints according to the Will of God."

What a prospect is opened here for us! Where and how does the 
Spirit make intercession for the saints? 

In no other way than that, in the heart which knows not what to pray, He
secretly and effectually prays what is according to the Will of God...

This of course implies that we trust Him to do His work in us and that we
remain before God even when we know what to pray, in the assurance 
that the Holy Spirit is praying for us...

What a difference it would make in the life of many of God's saints if
they realized this!

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help us to separate ourselves from the world.
Help us to yield ourselves wholeheartedly to the leading of the Spirit
within us, deepen all our thoughts or expectations. Help us to surrender
ourselves completely to You...
