05/18/09~~~food for thought~~~To further God's Kingdom, each of us have been 
given a gift ~ what are you doing with yours?

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through
the bond of peace. ~ There is one body and one Spirit,
just as you were called to one hope when you were
called...(Eph. 4:3-4)

Our Lesson for Today:

It is from Paul that we learn how the Christian communities in different 
place ought to remember each other in the fellowship of prayer...

In the times in which we live there is a great need that we as children
of God throughout the world be drawn closer together in the consciousness
of their being chosen by God to be a holy priesthood ministering continually 
in the sacrifice of praise and prayer...

All believers in Christ belong to one body; all are united under one head, 
Christ Himself. Each believer has received God-given abilities that can 
strengthen the whole body...

Your special ability may seem small it may even be large, but it is yours to use
in God's service. So ask God to use your unique gifts to contribute to the
strengthening and health of the body of believers...

Prayer Suggestion:
Lord, I thank You that I can be a part of the body of believers,
help me to recognize my full potential by using the gifts you have 
given me. Help me to realize the blessedness of being one in
heart and spirit with your people...
