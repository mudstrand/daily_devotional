06/02/09~~~food for thought~~~The strength that unity gives is inconceivable...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"They were all with one accord in one place...and they
were all filled with the Holy Spirit." (Acts 2:1, 4)

Our Lesson for Today:

Our last chapters opened up to us wonderful thoughts of
the solidarity of the whole body of Christ and the need to
cultivate the slumbering or buried talents of intercession...

We need to thank God, for we know of the tens of thousands
of His children who in daily prayer are pleading for some portion 
of the work of God's kingdom in which they are personally 
interested...

But in many cases there is a lack of that large-hearted and
universal love that takes up all the saints of God and their service
into His embrace. There is not the boldness and the strength
that comes from the consciousness of being part of a large
and conquering army under the leadership of our conquering
King...

The thought to remember is: The power of each individual member
is increased to a large degree by the inspiration of fellowship with a
large and conquering host...

Nothing can help us to an ever-larger faith as the consciousness of 
being one body and one spirit in Christ Jesus...

Prayer Suggestion:
Let us pray that we would always be mindful that
united prayer brings the answer to prayer.

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
