Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Our Father who art in heaven" (Lk. 11:2)

Our Lesson for Today:

How simple, how beautiful, this invocation which Christ puts upon our lips!
And yet how inconceivably rich in its meaning, in the fullness of the love and 
blessing it contains...

What a gift Christ bestowed on us when He gave us the right to say "Father!"
"The Father of Christ," "Our Father," "My Father."

And then, "Our Father in heaven," our heavenly Father. We should count it 
as a privilege as we bow in worship to know that the Father comes near to us 
where we are upon the earth...

As we gather up our thoughts of what fatherhood on earth has meant and hear
the voice of Christ saying: "How much more" we begen to feel the distance 
there is between the earthly picture and the heavenly reality, then and only then
can we bow in lowly, loving adoration...

Then and only then can we feel the full joy and power come to us as we rest
rejoicing in the words: "How much more shall your heavenly Father give
the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?"

Prayer Suggestion:
Drear Heavenly Father, Help me to live in such a way that
my life would show that I am a part of the family of God...
