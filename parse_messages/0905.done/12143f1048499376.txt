05/15/09~~~food for thought~~~Make sure that you are contributing in some way
to the ever-widening circle of God's message...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"When the Holy Spirit has come upon you, you will
receive power, and will tell people about Me every-
where"... (Acts 1:8)

Our Lesson for Today:

'The Power from the Holy Spirit' is not limited beyond the ordinary. 
That power also involves courage, boldness, confidence, insight,
ability, and authority...

The disciples would need all these gifts to fulfill their mission. If you
believe in Jesus Christ as your Savior, you can experience the power
of the Holy Spirit in your life...

Jesus promised the disciples that they would receive power to witness
after they received the Holy Spirit. Notice the progression: 
(1) They would receive the Holy Spirit,
(2) He would give them power, and
(3) They would witness with extraordinary results...

Often we try to reverse the order and witness by our own power and
authority. Witnessing is not showing what we do for God. It is showing 
and telling what God has done for us...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, help me to believe that in answer
to prayer, the crucified Jesus will do far more than I can 
ask or think...
