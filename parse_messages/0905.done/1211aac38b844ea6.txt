Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Being assembled with them, He charged them not to depart
from Jerusalem to wait for the promise of the Father." (Acts 1:4)

Our Lesson for Today:

If we would truly understand the outpouring of the Holy Spirit's answer
to the prayer of the disciples, we must ask: What was there in these men
that qualified them for such power, effectual prayer and the wonderful 
fulfillment of the promise that came to them???

Lets remember they were simple, unlearned men with many faults, but 
whom the Lord had called to forsake all and follow Him...

And oh yes we must also remember, They had done this, as far as they
could: they followed Him in the life He led and the work He did...

Oh yes like us there was much sin in them and they had as yet no power 
to fully deny themselves, but at the same time their hearts clung to Him 
in deep sincerity...

Even in the midst of much stumbling they still followed Him to the cross.
They shared with Him His death; unconsciously but most really, they died 
with Him to sin and were raised with Him in the power of new life...

Let this be the test by which we try ourselves whether we have indeed 
surrendered to the fellowship of Christ's suffering and death, and whether we 
have hated our old life and crucified it ~ and have received the power of
Christ's life in us...

Prayer Suggestion:
Lord make me a willing learner in the school of Jesus,
seeking above everything else that intimate fellowship
with Him...
