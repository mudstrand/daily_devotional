if it lies within the will of God...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"They are not of this world even as I am not
of the world." (Jn. 17:14, 16)

Our Lesson for Today:

In His last night our Lord took pains to make clear to His disciples
the impassable gulf between Him and the world and between them
and the world too (Jn. 16:16-21)...

He had said of the Spirit: "The world cannot receive Him, because 
it seeth not, neither knoweth Him." "Because ye are not of the world, 
therefore the world hateth you."

One great mark of the disciples was to live so little as the world, that they
become one with Christ. They both belonged to another world, the Kingdom
of heaven...

This separation from the world is to be the mark of everyone who is filled
with the Spirit...

Prayer Suggestion:
Help me day by day to pick up my cross to follow you.
As You are not of this world, even-so help me to put
aside worldly things...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
