05/28/09~~~food for thought~~~Pray that we might speak boldly of our faith...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I
may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery 
of the Gospel, that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought
to speak." (Eph. 6:19-20)

Our Lesson for Today:

"And for me" ~ What light these words cast on the deep
reality of Paul's faith in the absolute necessity and the 
wonderful power of prayer...

What a call to us in the twentieth century to awake to the
consciousness that Christ our Intercessor in heaven and 
all God's children here upon the earth are engaged in one 
mighty contest, and that it is our duty to call out and to
cultivate the gift of unceasing supplication for the power 
of God's Spirit in all His servants, that all may have divine
utterances given them and that all may speak boldly and 
as they ought to speak...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, by the power of Your Holy Spirit
in all Your servants, may we speak boldly and as we
ought to speak...
