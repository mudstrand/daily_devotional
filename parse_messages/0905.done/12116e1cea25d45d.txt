05/07/09~~~food for thought~~~Christ want to live in your heart...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"God hath made that same Jesus, whom you have crucified,
both Lord and Christ." (Acts 2:36)

Our Lesson for Today:

This our King is the crucified Jesus. God has place Him in
the midst of His throne as a lamb, as it has been slain, and 
so all the hosts of heaven adore Him ~ and so we worship
Him as a King...

Christ's cross is His highest glory. It is through this, that He 
has conquered every enemy and gained His place on the 
throne of God. AND it is this that He will impart to us too if
we are to know fully what the victory over sin is to mean...

When Paul wrote: "I have been crucified with Christ, Christ
liveth in me," he taught us that it was the crucified One and
that Christ ruled on the throne of his heart and that the spirit 
of the cross would triumph over us as it did in Him...

So let us surrender our will, and the entire self-denial of our
old nature, so that we can become the worthy servants of a 
crucified King, and so that our hearts become worthy temples
of His glory...

Prayer Suggestion:
Lord make me a worthy servant and my heart a
worthy temple of Your glory
