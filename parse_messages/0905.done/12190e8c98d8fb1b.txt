05/30/09~~~food for Thought~~~There is much power in unified prayer...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"We trust in God that He will yet deliver us; 
you also helping together by prayer for us" (2 Cor. 1:10-11)

Our Lesson for Today:

This subject calls us once again to think of all the believers
throughout the world but leads us to view them from a 
different standpoint...

If we are to ask God to increase the number and the power of 
those who do pray, we shall be led to form some impression of
what the hope is that our circle of intercessors may gradually 
increase in number and power...

This message is sent out like radio waves to all who desire to be
in touch with it and to seek to prove their consecration to the Lord 
in the unceasing daily supplication for the Power of His love and
Spirit to be revealed to all His people...

Prayer Suggestion:
Let us pray that as believers we would all be of one
mind ~ that of giving glory to God...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
