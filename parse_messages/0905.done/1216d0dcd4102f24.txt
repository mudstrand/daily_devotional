Our Bible Verse for Today:
"I want you to know how much I have agonized for you ~
(Col. 2:1a)

Our Lesson for Today:

Just as those who are undertaking a great thing have to prepare themselves
and seek all their powers to their aid, so too Christians need to prepare
themselves to pray, 'with their whole heart and strength.'

This is the law of the Kingdom. Prayer needs sacrifice of ease, of time,
of self. The secret of powerful prayer is sacrifice. It was so with Christ,
the great Intercessor. 

Here is what is written about Him, "When thou shalt make his soul an 
offering for sin, He shall see His seed." "He shall see of the travail of 
His soul." He shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he hath 
poured out unto death."

In Gethsemane "He offered up prayer and supplications with strong crying 
and tears." 

Prayer is sacrifice. Our prayer has its worth alone from being rooted in the
sacrifice of Jesus Christ. As He gave up everything in His prayer: "Thy 
Will be done," Our posture and disposition must ever be the offering up
of everything to God and His service...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord help me to learn that the secret of powerful
prayer is sacrifice ~ sacrifice of ease, of time, and of
self...
