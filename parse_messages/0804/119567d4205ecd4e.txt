04/16/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ In order to receive direction from God you must
be able to receive correction from God...(Heb. 12:5b, 6) 

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Because Jesus Christ, the Son of God, never wavers between 
yes and no, He is the one whom Timothy, Silas, and I preached 
to you, and He is the divine ~ Yes God's affirmation...

For all of God's promises have been fulfilled in Him. That is why
we say "Amen" when we give glory to God through Christ...(2 Cor. 1:19, 20) NLT

Our Lesson for Today:

All of God's promises of what the Messiah would be like
are fulfilled in Christ ("He is the divine Yes"). Jesus was 
completely faithful in His ministry; He never sinned (I Pet. 3:18).

He faithfully died for us (Heb. 2:9); and now He faithfully
intercedes for us (Ro. 8:34; Heb. 4:14)

Because Jesus Christ is faithful, Paul wanted to be faithful
in his ministry. 

Christ's example should also be our directive, our guiding
light.

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to be sensitive to Your
leading and guiding. Help me to remain faithful in my
daily walk, so that Your light would shine through me...Amen.

Keep looking up, and the Son will always be in your eyes...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
