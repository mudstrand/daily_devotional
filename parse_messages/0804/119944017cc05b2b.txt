Our Bible Verse for Today:

And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the Lord's glory,
are being transformed into His likeness with ever-increasing
glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit...(2 Cor. 3:18)

Our Lesson for Today:

The glory that the Spirit imparts to the believer is more excellent
and lasts longer than the glory that Moses experienced...

By gazing at the nature of God with unveiled minds, we can be 
more like Him. In the Good News, we see the truth about Christ,
and it transforms us morally as we understand and apply it...

Through learning about Christ's life, we can understand how 
wonderful God is and what He is really like. As our knowledge
deepens, the Holy Spirit helps us to change...

Becoming Christ-like is a progressive experience (see Ro. 8:29;
Gal. 4:19; 1 Jn. 3:2). The more closely we follow Christ, the 
more we will be like Him...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that You would help me to
become more knowledgeable about You. Help me to grow 
in wisdom so that I would become more Christ-like...

Keep looking up, He will impart onto you His glory...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
