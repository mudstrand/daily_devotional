Happy Easter!

(EDITH BURNS - RECEIVED GOD'S BLESSING - AN EXAMPLE FOR US!)

THE STORY OF EDITH BURNS..

Happy Easter!

Edith Burns was a wonderful Christian who lived in San 
Antonio, Texas.
She was the patient of a doctor by the name of Will Phillips. 
Dr. Phillips was a gentle doctor who saw patients as people. His 
favorite Patient was Edith Burns.

One morning he went to his office with a heavy heart and it 
was because Of Edith Burns. When he walked into that waiting room, there 
sat Edith With her big black Bible in her lap earnestly talking to a 
young mother Sitting beside her.

Edith Burns had a habit of introducing herself in this way: 
'Hello, my Name is Edith Burns. Do you believe in Easter?' Then she 
would explain The meaning of Easter, and many times people would be saved.

Dr. Phillips walked into that office and there he saw the head nurse,
Beverly. Beverly had first met Edith when she was taking her 
blood Pressure. Edith began by saying,'My name is Edith Burns. Do 
you believe In Easter?'

Beverly said, 'Why yes I do.'
Edith said, 'Well, what do you believe about Easter?'
Beverly said, 'Well, it's all about egg hunts, going to 
church, and Dressing up.' Edith kept pressing her about the real meaning 
of Easter, And finally led her to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.

Dr. Phillips said, 'Beverly, don't call Edith into the office quite
Yet. I believe there is another delivery taking place in the 
waiting Room.

After being called back in the doctor's office, Edith sat down 
and when She took a look at the doctor she said, 
'Dr. Will, why are you so sad?
Are you reading your Bible? Are you praying?'

Dr. Phillips said gently, 'Edith, I'm the doctor and you're the
Patient.' With a heavy heart he said, 'Your lab report came 
back and it Says you have cancer, and Edith, you're not going to live very 
long.'
Edith said, 'Why Will Phillips, shame on you. Why are you so sad? Do
You think God makes mistakes? You have just told me I'm going 
to see my Precious Lord Jesus, my husband, and my friends. You have just 
told me That I am going to celebrate Easter forever, and here you are 
having Difficulty giving me my ticket!'

Dr. Phillips thought to himself, 'What a magnificent woman this Edith
Burns is!'

Edith continued coming to Dr Phillips. Christmas came and the office
Was closed through January 3rd. On the day the office opened, 
Edith did Not show up. Later that afternoon, Edith called Dr. Phillips 
and said She would have to be moving her story to the hospital and 
said, 'Will, I'm very near home, so would you make sure that they put women 
in here Next to me in my room who need to know about Easter.'

Well, they did just that and women began to come in and share that room
With Edith. Many women were saved. Everybody on that floor from staff
To patients were so excited about Edith, that they started calling her
Edith Easter; that is everyone except Phyllis Cross, the head nurse.

Phyllis made it plain that she wanted nothing to do with Edith because
She was a 'religious nut'. She had been a nurse in an army hospital. She
Had seen it all and heard it all. She was the original G.I. Jane. She
Had been married three times, she was hard, cold, and did everything by
The book.

One morning the two nurses who were to attend to Edith were sick. Edith
Had the flu and Phyllis Cross had to go in and give her a shot. When she
Walked in, Edith had a big smile on her face and said, 'Phyllis, God
Loves you and I love you, and I have been praying for you.'

Phyllis Cross said, 'Well, you can quit praying for me, it won't work.
I'm not interested.'
Edith said, 'Well, I will pray and I have asked God not to let me go
Home until you come into the family.'

Phyllis Cross said, 'Then you will never die because that will never
Happen,' and curtly walked out of the room.

Every day Phyllis Cross would walk into the room and Edith would say,
'God loves you Phyllis and I love you, and I'm praying for you.'

One day Phyllis Cross said she was literally drawn to Edith's room like
a magnet would draw iron. She sat down on the bed and Edith said, 'I'm
so glad you have come, because God told me that today is your 
special day.'

Phyllis Cross said, 'Edith, you have asked everybody here the question,
'Do you believe in Easter but you have never asked me.'

Edith said, 'Phyllis, I wanted to many times, but God told me to wait
until you asked, and now that you have asked.'
Edith Burns took her Bible and shared with Phyllis Cross the Easter
Story of the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ. 
Edith said, 'Phyllis, do you believe in Easter? Do you believe that Jesus 
Christ is alive and that He wants to live in your heart?'

Phyllis Cross said, 'Oh I want to believe that with all of my heart,
and I do want Jesus in my life. 'Right there, Phyllis Cross 
prayed and invited Jesus Christ into her heart. For the first time 
Phyllis Cross did not walk out of a hospital room, she was carried out on 
the wings of angels.

Two days later, Phyllis Cross came in and Edith said, 'Do you 
know what day it is?' Phyllis Cross said, 'Why Edith, it's Good Friday.'

Edith said, 'Oh, no, for you every day is Easter. Happy Easter
Phyllis!'
Two days later, on Easter Sunday, Phyllis Cross came into 
work, did some of her duties and then went down to the flower shop and 
got some Easter lilies because she wanted to go up to see Edith and 
give her some Easter lilies and wish her a Happy Easter.

When she walked into Edith's room, Edith was in bed. That big 
black Bible was on her lap. Her hands were in that Bible. There was 
a sweet smile on her face. When Phyllis Cross went to pick up Edith's 
hand, she realized Edith was dead. Her left hand was on John 14: 'In my 
Father's house are many mansions. I go to prepare a place for you, I 
will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you 
may be also.' Her right hand was on Revelation 21:4, 'And God will 
wipe away every tear from their eyes, there shall be no more death nor 
sorrow, nor crying; and there shall be no more pain, for the former things 
have passed away.'

Phyllis Cross took one look at that dead body, and then lifted her face
toward heaven, and with tears streaming down here cheeks, said, 'Happy
Easter, Edith - Happy Easter!'

Phyllis Cross left Edith's body, walked out of the room, and over to a
table where two student nurses were sitting. She said, 'My name is
hyllis Cross. Do you believe in Easter?'

If you believe in Easter, forward this on. God works in wonderful ways,
and to believe in his power is to truly be free. If Jesus had e-mail,
he'd do the same for you.

(Actually, maybe He just did),
