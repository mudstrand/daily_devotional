not merely to get good...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

If Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you,
for he is carrying on the work of the Lord, just as I am...

No one, then, should refuse to accept Him, Send Him on His way in peace
so that he may return to me. I am expecting him along with his brothers,
(I Cor. 16:10, 11) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul was sending Timothy ahead to Corinth. Paul respected Timothy and
had worked closely with him...

Even though Timothy was young, Paul encourage the Corinthian Church to
welcome him because he was doing the Lord's work...

God's work is not limited by age...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me when I neglect to do
the things you have for me to do. Help me to recognize
the gifts I have been given and use them well...Amen.

Keep looking up, and you will have the Son in your eyes...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
