04/29/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ True peace comes only from God. (Jn. 14:27)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Therefore, since through God's mercy we have this ministry,
we do not lose heart.

Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways;
we do not use deception, nor do we distort the Word of God.
on the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend 
ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God...
(2 Cor. 4:1, 2) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Preachers, and teachers, and anyone else who talks about Jesus
Christ must remember that they stand in God's presence ~ He
hears every word. He also sees our every action...

When you tell people about Christ, be careful not to distort the message
to please those you are sharing it with. Proclaim the truth of God's Word
and allow the Holy Spirit to do the rest...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, when I have occasion to share 
Your Word, I pray that I would do it in such a way it
would be pleasing to You, and not merely to tickle the
ears of my listeners...Amen.

Keep looking up, and He will give you peace...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
