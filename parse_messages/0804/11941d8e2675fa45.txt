04/12/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ The secret to contentment is the realization
that life is a gift not a right...(1 Tim. 6:6, 7)

Our Bible Verse for Today:

I think you ought to know, dear brothers and sisters, about the trouble we went
through in the province or Asia. We were crushed and completely overwhelmed,
and we thought we would never live through it...

In fact, we expected to die. But as a result, we learned not to rely on ourselves
but on God who can raise the dead...

And He did deliver us from mortal danger, and we are confident that He will continue
to deliver us...(2 Cor. 1:8-10) NLT

Our Lesson for Today:

We often depend on our own skills and abilities when life seems easy 
and only turn to God when we feel unable to help ourselves...

But as we realize our own powerlessness without Him and our need
for His constant help in our lives, we come to depend on Him more
and more...

God is our source of power, and we receive His help by keeping in
touch with Him. With this attitude of dependence, problems will drive
us to God rather than away from Him. Learn how to rely on God daily...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father I thank You for always being there for
me 24/7. I pray for continued strength to endure the trials of
this life and that one day You will take me home to be with You...Amen.

Keep looking up, and the Son will always be in your eyes...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
