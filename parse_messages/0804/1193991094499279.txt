>
> An elderly Chinese woman had two
>>large pots, each hung on the ends of a pole which she carried across her
>>neck. One of the pots had a crack in it while the other pot was perfect
>>and always delivered a full portion of water. At the end of the long walk
>>from the stream to the house, the cracked pot arrived only half full. For 
>>a
>>full two years this went on daily, with the woman bringing home only one
>>and a half pots of water. Of course, the perfect pot was proud of its
>>accomplishments. But the poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own
>>imperfection, and miserable that it could only do half of what it had 
>>been
>>made to do. After two years of what it perceived to be bitter failure, it
>>spoke to the woman one day by the stream. "I am ashamed of myself, 
>>because
>>this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back to your
>>house." The old woman smiled, "Did you notice that there are flowers on
>>your side of the path, but not on the other pot's side?" "That's because I
>>have always known about your flaw, so I planted flower seeds on your side
>>of the path, and every day while we walk back, you water them." "For two
>>years I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate the
>>table. Without you being just the way you are, there would not be this
>>beauty to grace the house." Each of us has our own unique flaw. But it's
>>the cracks and flaws we each have that make our lives together so very
>>interesting and rewarding. You've just got to take each person for what
>>they are and look for the good in them. SO, to all of my crackpot friends,
>>have a great day and remember to smell the flowers on your side of the
> path!
