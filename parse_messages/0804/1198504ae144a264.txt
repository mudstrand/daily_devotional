Our Bible Verses for Today"

Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in
letters on stone, came with glory, so that Israelites could not
look steadily as the face of Moses because of its glory, fading 
though it was,

will not the ministry of the Spirit be more glorious? If the ministry
that condemns men is glorious, how much more glorious is the
ministry that brings righteousness! (2 Cor. 3:7-9) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul contrasts the glory of the 10 commandments with the glory of
the new covenant. If the Law that leads to death was glorious, how
much more glorious is God's plan which gives us life through the Spirit...

Paul says, if the old covenant had its glory (and it certainly did), just
imagine how glorious the new covenant is...

The law was wonderful because, even though it condemned us, it
pointed us to Christ. But in the New Covenant, the law and the promise 
are fulfilled...

By grace, and faith in Christ's finished work we can be made right with God!

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father I thank You for Your superior plan which took the
place of the "Old Covenant." I thank You for the commandments because
they do remind us of our need for a Savior...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will always be there for You...
You are in the Prayers of two who care...
