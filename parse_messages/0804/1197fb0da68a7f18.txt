Our Bible Verse for Today:

He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant ~ 
not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the 
Spirit gives life...(2 Cor. 3:6) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

"The old way ends in death, in the new way, the Holy Spirit gives life"
means that trying to be saved by keeping the Old Testament laws
will end in death...

Only by believing in the Lord Jesus Christ can a person receive 
eternal life through the Holy Spirit. No one but Jesus has ever fulfilled 
the Law perfectly; so, the whole world is condemned to death...

The Law makes people realize their sin, but it cannot give life. Under
the new covenant, which means promise or agreement, eternal life come
from the Holy Spirit. The Spirit gives life to all who believe in Christ...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the faith which the 
Holy Spirit plants in me, I thank you that my salvation comes
by grace through faith in Jesus Christ...Amen.

Keep looking up, He answers prayer...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
