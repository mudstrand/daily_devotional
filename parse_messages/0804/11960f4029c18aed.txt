04/18/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ It's the little things of life that determine
the big things...(Mt. 25:21b)

Yesterdays devo was not 2 Cor. 2:21, 22 but
2 Cor. 1:21, 22

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Paul says, "I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart 
and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the 
depth of my love for you. (2 Cor. 2:4) NIV

Our lesson for Today:

Paul did not enjoy reprimanding his friends and fellow believers,
but he cared enough about the Corinthians to confront them with
their wrongdoing, Proverbs 27:6 says "Wounds from a friend are 
better than many kisses from an enemy."

Sometimes our friends make choices that we know are wrong. If
we ignore their behavior and let them continue in it, we won't be 
showing love to them...

We show our love when we honestly share our concerns in order 
to help our friends to be their very best for God. When we don't 
make any move to help, we show that we are more concerned 
about being well liked than about what will happen to them...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, help me to always put my concern for others
ahead of my own popularity. Help me correct with humility and love.
Bless my e-mail friends with health and safety...Amen.

Keep looking up, and the Son will always be in your eyes...
You are in the prayers of two who care... 
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
