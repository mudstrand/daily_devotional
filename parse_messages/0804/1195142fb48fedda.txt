opposing wind raises it higher...(Isa. 40:31)

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted
ourselves in the world, and especially in our relationships with you, in the
holiness and sincerity that are from God. We have done so not according 
to worldly wisdom but according to God's grace... (2 Cor. 1:12) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul knew the importance of honesty and sincerity in word
and actions, especially in a situation as in Corinth, where
constructive criticism was necessary...

So Paul did not approach with impressive human knowledge
(earthly wisdom)...

God wants us to be real and transparent in all our relationships.
If we aren't, we may end up lowering ourselves to spreading 
rumors, gossiping, and second guessing...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that I would always be open and
forth-right in my relationships with others. Forgive me when I am
less than honest in all my words and actions...Amen.

Keep looking up, and the Son will always be in your eyes...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
