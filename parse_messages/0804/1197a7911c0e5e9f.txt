Our Bible Verses for Today:

Such confidences as this is ours through Christ before God...

Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for
ourselves, but our competence comes from God...(2 Cor 3:4, 5) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul was not boasting he gave God the credit for all his accomplishments...

While false teachers boast about their own power and success, Paul 
expresses his humility before God. No one can claim to be adequate
without God's help. No one is competent to carry out the responsibilities
of God's calling in his or her own strength.

Without the Holy Spirit's enabling, our natural talent can carry us only so
far. As Christ's witnesses, we need the character and special strength
that only God gives...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for the Holy Spirit's
work in my heart. I pray that I would continually follow
His leading...Amen.

Keep looking up, while you stand your ground...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie
