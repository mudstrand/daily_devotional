does not equal productiveness...(Lk. 10:40-42).

Our Bible Verses for Today;

It is God who give us, along with you, the ability to stand firm for
Christ. He has commissioned us, 

and He has identified us as His own by placing the Holy Spirit
in our hearts as the first installment of everything He will give us.
2 Cor. 2:21, 22) NLT

Our Lesson for Today:

The Holy Spirit guarantees that we belong to God and will receive
His benefits (Eph. 1:13, 14). The Holy Spirit guarantees that salvation 
is ours now, and that we will receive so much more when Christ returns...

The great comfort and power that the Holy Spirit gives in this life is a 
foretaste or a down payment of the benefits of eternal life in God's
presence...

With the privilege of belonging to God comes the responsibility of
identifying ourselves as His faithful servants. Don't be ashamed 
to let others know that you are His...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the benefits that are mine
In Christ Jesus. I thank You for looking at me as Your child, and
I thank You for the gift of eternal life...Amen.

Keep looking up, and the Son will always be in your eyes...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
