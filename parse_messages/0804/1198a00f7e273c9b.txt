Our Bible Verses for Today: 

Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.

But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.

Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is,
there is freedom... (2 Cor 3:15-17) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Those who were trying to be saved by keeping the Old Testament
Law were soon tied up in rules and ceremonies. But now, through
the Holy Spirit, God provides freedom from sin and condemnation
(Ro. 8:1)...

When we trust Christ to save us, He removes our heavy burden of 
trying to please Him, and our guilt for failing to do so. By trusting 
Christ we are loved, accepted, forgiven, and freed to live for Him.

"Wherever the Spirit of the Lord is, He gives freedom."

Our Prayer for Today:
I thank You for providing freedom from sin and condemnation.
I thank You that I am loved, accepted, and free to live for Christ.
I thank You for the sure way You have provided to eternal life...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is the Way the Truth, and the Life...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
