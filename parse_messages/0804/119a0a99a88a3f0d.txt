This is one of the best prayers I think I have ever
read.



PRAY THIS EVEN IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE IT!!

IT WILL ONLY TAKE A MINUTE.

I started not to do this, but as I read it, I
understood God to Say, 'You need a miracle
tomorrow'...so here goes...

Prov. 29:25...

You never know when God is going to bless you!!

Good things happen when you least expect them to !!!!
Change the number in the subject box when you
forward it by adding one.

Dear Lord, I thank You for this day,

I thank You for my being able to see and to hear this
morning. I'm blessed because You are a forgiving
God and an understanding God.

You have done so much for me and You keep on blessing me.

Forgive me this day for everything I have done, said or thought
that was not pleasing to you.

I ask now for Your forgiveness.

Please keep me safe from all danger and harm. Help me to start this
day with a new attitude and plenty of gratitude.

Let me make the best of each and every day to clear my mind so
that I can hear from You. Please broaden my mind that I can
accept all things.

Let me not whine and whimper over things I have no control over
and give the best response when I'm pushed beyond my limits.

I know that when I can't pray, You listen to my heart. Continue to
use me to do Your will.

Continue to bless me that I may be a blessing to
others. Keep me strong that I may help the weak...

Keep me uplifted that I may have words of encouragement for others.

I pray for those that are lost and can't find their way.

I pray for those that are misjudged and misunderstood.

I pray for those who don't know You intimately.

I pray for those that will delete this without sharing it with others.

I pray for those that don't believe.

But I thank you that I believe that God changes people and God changes
things. I pray for all my sisters and brothers. For each and every family
member in their households.

I pray for peace , love and joy in their homes that they are out of debt and
all their needs are met. I pray that every eye that reads thi s knows there 
is no
problem, circumstance, or situation greater than God.

Every battle is in Your hands for You to fight.

I pray that these words be received into the hearts of
every eye that sees it.

If you prayed this prayer, change the number in the subject box before
forwarding the message so people can see how many people have done so.

God Bless!!!!!!!!!!!

Just repeat this phrase and see how God moves!!

God I love you and I need you, come into my heart, please.

Pass this message on, except you and me.
