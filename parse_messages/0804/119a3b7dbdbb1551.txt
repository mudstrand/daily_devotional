05/01/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ It's not about falling down, it's about how you get up...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

We do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord,
and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake...(2 Cor. 4:5) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

The focus of Paul's preaching was not himself but Christ...

When you witness, tell people about what Christ has done and not
about your abilities and accomplishments...

People must be introduced to Christ, not to you. And if you hear 
someone preaching about himself or his own ideas rather than 
about Christ, beware ~ he is a false teacher...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, instill in me a willingness to serve others 
even when it requires a sacrifice of time and personal desires.
Help me to be ready to serve others, even when they do not
measure up to my expectations...Amen.

Keep looking up, He wants to use you...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
