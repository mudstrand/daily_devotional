scratch and keep on scratching...(Lk. 8:15)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father 
of all compassion and the God of comfort,

who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those who
are in trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God...

For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also
through Christ our comfort overflows...(2 Cor. 1:3-5) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Many think that when God comforts us, our troubles should go away. But if
that were always so, people would turn to God only out of a desire to be
relieved of pain and not out of love for Him...

We must understand that being "comforted" can also mean receiving strength,
encouragement, and hope to deal with our troubles. The more we suffer, the
more comfort God gives us...

If you are feeling overwhelmed, allow God to comfort you. Remember that every
trial you endure will help you comfort other people who are suffering similar
troubles...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray for the patience to wait on you.
I pray that in that waiting I would also grow in faith and love
toward You...Amen.

Keep looking up, and the Son will be in your eyes
You are in the prayers of two who care...
