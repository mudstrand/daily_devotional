I'll be gone all week-end so here is Saturdays Devo.

04/05/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ The best way to get the last word is to 
apologize...(Pro. 6:2, 3)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

But thanks be to God Who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ...

Therefore my dear brothers, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always
give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that
your labor in the Lord is not in vain...(I Cor. 15:57, 58) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

What Paul is trying to get across to us is that because of the resurrection,
nothing we do is useless. I believe that to often we become apathetic about
serving the Lord because we don't see the results...

But knowing that Christ has won the ultimate victory should really affect the 
way we live right now. Don't let discouragement over some lack of results
keep you from doing the work of the Lord enthusiastically as you have
opportunity...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for not always doing your
work as I should. Help me to forge forward doing your work
in faith seizing every opportunity...Amen

Keep looking up, and you will always have the Son in your eyes...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
