Our Bible Verses for Today:

Even if our Gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those 
who are perishing...

The God of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers,
so that they can not see the light of the gospel of the glory
of Christ, who is the image of God...(2 Cor. 4:3, 4) NIV.

Our Lesson for Today:

The Good News is available to everyone, except to those
who refuse to believe...

Satan is "the god of this evil world." His work is to deceive, 
and he has blinded those who do not believe in Christ (see
2 Cor. 11:14, 15).

The allure of money, power, and pleasure blinds people to 
the light of Christ's Good News. Those who reject Christ 
and prefer their own pursuits have unknowingly made Satan
their god...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the "Good News" 
of the Gospel. I pray that You would help me to continually
reject Satan's devious ways. Bless my e-mail friends with
good health and safety...Amen.

Keep looking up, He wants to be your Savior...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
