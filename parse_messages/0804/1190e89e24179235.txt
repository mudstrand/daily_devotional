04/02/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ Authority makes some people grow and
others just swell...(Mt. 23:11, 12)

Our Bible Verse for Today:

What I am saying, dear brothers and sister, is that flesh and blood 
cannot inherit the kingdom of God. These perishable bodies of ours
are not able to live forever...(I Cor 15:50) NLT

Our Lesson for Today:

We all face limitations of one sort or another. Some may have physical,
some mental, others emotional disabilities...

Some may be blind, but they still can see a new way to live. Some may 
be deaf, but they can hear God's Good News...

Some may be lame, but they can walk in God's love. In addition, they 
have the encouragement that those disabilities are only temporary.

Paul tells us that we will all be given new bodies when Christ returns
and that these bodies will be without disabilities, never to die or become 
sick. This can give us hope in our suffering...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the encouragement
that these mortal bodies will be exchanged for a body which
will last for all eternity, with not one disability...Amen.

Keep looking up, He wants to help you through your difficulties...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
