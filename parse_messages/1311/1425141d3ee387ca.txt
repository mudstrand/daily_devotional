Today's Verse: Ps. 23:4

Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
evil,

for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 

Today's Thoughts:

Death can cast a frightening shadow over us, because we are entirely
helpless in

its presence. We can struggle with other enemies-pain, suffering, disease,
and 

injury, but strength and courage cannot overcome death-It has the final
word.



ONLY ONE PERSON-can walk with us through death's dark valley and bring 

us safely to the other side-to the God of life, our shepherd-



Because life is uncertain, we should follow this shepherd who offers us
eternal comfort.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord of all life, let me feel Your Spirit's presence when that dark valley
comes. Lead

me to the other side where there will be eternal comfort. . .Amen. 



Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

As in the Master's Spirit you take into your arms the little ones,

His own everlasting arms will encircle them and you.

(James Hamilton)
