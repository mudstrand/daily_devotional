Today's Verses: Ps. 24:4-6

He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to
what is false and does not swear deceitfully.

5 He will receive blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the God of
his salvation. 

6 Such is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek the face of the God
of Jacob. 

Today's Thoughts:

Vs. 4 refers to all lies, especially those told under oath. God truly values
honesty.

Dishonesty come easily, especially when complete truthfulness could cost us
something, 

make us uncomfortable, or put us is an unfavorable light. Dishonest
communication 

hinders relationships. Without honesty, a relationship with God is
impossible. If we lie 

to others, we will begin to deceive ourselves. 

God cannot hear us or speak to us if we are building a wall of deception. .
.



God has set before us a choice-either a curse or a blessing. It is amazing
how so many 

through their disobedience have chosen the curse. YES we have a choice to
make-what 

will it be a blessing or a curse. 

We can live for ourselves OR live in service to God. To choose our own
way-is to live 

on a dead-end road, but to choose God's way is to receive eternal life (Jn.
5:24). 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, how good and faithful You are in spite of my sinfulness and
unfaithfulness.

As Your baptized child, I return to You for forgiveness and for renewed zeal
to do

Your will; in Jesus name. Amen. 



Pastor Al & Marcie Sather

I will thank the Lord because He is just;

I will sing praises to the name of the Lord Most High.
