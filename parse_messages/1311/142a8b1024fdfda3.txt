Today's Verses: Ps. 27:4-6

4 I have asked one thing from the Lord. This I will seek: to remain in the
Lord's house all the days of my life

in order to gaze at the Lord's beauty and to search for an answer in His
temple.

5 He hides me in His shelter when there is trouble. He keeps me hidden in
His tent. He sets me high on a rock. 

6 Now my head will be raised above my enemies who surround me. I will offer
sacrifices with shouts of joy in His tent. 

I will sing and make music to praise the Lord. 

Today's Thoughts:

By the "house of the Lord" and "His Temple," David could have been referring
to the Tabernacle in Gibeon, 

or to the Temple that his son Solomon was to build-but David may have also
used the word Temple to mean 

"The presence of the Lord." His greatest wish was to live in God presence
each day of his life.

Sadly this is not the greatest desire of many who claim to be believers. But
those who desire to live in God's 

presence each day will be able to enjoy that relationship forever. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, I thank You for the help You offer for today and a hope for the
future.

I pray for an unwavering confidence in You so that I may never fear those 

dark days that may trouble me. . . Amen.
