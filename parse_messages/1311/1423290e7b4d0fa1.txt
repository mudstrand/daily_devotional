Today's Verses: Psalms 22:4-6 (NLT)

4 Our ancestors trusted in you, and you rescued them.

5 They cried out to you and were saved. They trusted in you and were never
disgraced. 
6 But I am a worm and not a man. I am scorned and despised by all! 

Today's Thoughts:

When others despise us and belittle us, they treat us as if we were less
than human.

After being degraded we may become like David, and feel like worms and
possibly

Feel like maybe they are right-maybe I am no good.



When we feel the sting of rejection we need to keep in mind the hope and
victory

that God promises us. Yes He has said, "I will never leave you or forsake
you."

That to us should be enough. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, when I feel down and out, remind me that You are there for me.

Remind me again of the love You have for us all and that this life is not 

all that there is. Remind me again of that wonderful day when I will arrive 

at the place You promised with no more pain or suffering-where love 

reigns supreme. Amen.
