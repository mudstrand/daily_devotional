Today's Verses: Psalms 21:11-12 (NLT)

11 Although they plot against you, their evil schemes will never succeed.

12 For they will turn and run when they see your arrows aimed at them. 

Today's Thoughts:

When you see people succeeding with evil acts, remember they will not
succeed forever.

Their power is only temporary, and God's very presence can send them
scattering in a 

moment. God, according to His plan and purpose, will intervene for His
people and give 

the wicked the judgment they deserve. 



We should not be dismayed when we see the temporary advantage God's enemies
seem to have.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, Help me to always have You at the center of my life so that I may


acquire Godly wisdom which is the best strength I can have. . . Amen.



Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

Unless you change and become like little childern,

You will never enter the Kingom of heaven. . . Mat. 18:3 NIV



I have never seen any stronger faith than what I have seen in a child.
