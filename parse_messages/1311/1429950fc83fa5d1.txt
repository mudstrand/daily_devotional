Today's Verses: Ps. 26:6-8

6 I will wash my hands in innocence. I will walk around your altar, O Lord, 

7 so that I may loudly sing a hymn of thanksgiving and tell about all your
miracles. 
8 O Lord, I love the house where you live, the place where your glory
(light) shines. 

Today's Thoughts:

God's light represents what is good, pure, true, holy and reliable. Of
course darkness 

represents what is sinful and evil. God alone can guide us out of the
darkness of sin. 

Light is also related to the truth in that light exposes whatever exists,
whether it is 

good or bad. David exclaimed how he loved to worship in the house where the
Lord lived.



We should worship God with the same love and reverence as David did. . . 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, make me a faithful witness to the Savior so 

that others may walk with me to heaven. . .Amen

Simplicity reaches out after God; purity discovers and enjoys Him.
