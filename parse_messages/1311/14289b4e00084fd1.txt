Today's Verses: Ps. 25:19-21

19 See how my enemies have increased in number, how they have hated me with
vicious hatred! 

20 Protect my life, and rescue me! Do not let me be put to shame. I have
taken refuge in You. 

21 May integrity and honesty protect me, for I put my hope in You.

Today's Thoughts:

If ever two powerful forces were needed to preserve us along life's way, 

they are integrity and honesty. The psalmist asks for these to protect him 

step by step. Honesty makes us learn God's requirements and strive to 

fulfill them. Integrity-being what we say we are-keeps us from claiming 

to be honest while living as if we do not know God. . .



Honesty-says, "This is the Shepherds way." 

And integrity-says, "I will walk consistently in it."

Are you walking consistently in the Shepherds way?



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, in my weakness and with my sins, help me hear 

Your loving voice calling me. . .Amen.

Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

We rejoice in our sufferings, becausse we know that suffering produces 

perseverance; preseverance, character, and character, hope. Ro. 5:3
