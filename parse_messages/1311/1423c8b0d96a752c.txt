Today's Verses: Ps. 22:21-22

21 Snatch me from the lion's jaws and from the horns of these wild oxen. 
22 I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters. I will praise you
among your assembled people. 

Today's Thoughts:

We see here that David promises to praise God among the people because his
private deliverance 

deserved a public testimony. At times we may go through trials not because
we want to suffer-

BUT because we want to obey God's will. 

Let the example of Jesus' obedience sustain and encourage you in times of
trial. You will be able 

to face anything if you know that Jesus is with you. Let us always be
prepared to offer public 

praise for His care for us.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, our Savior and comforter, in You I can stand against the trials of
life because I know 

You are with me. May Your Spirit guide me in coming before You in reverent
submission, 

willing to do whatever God wants. . . Amen.

I Cor. 3:20 The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are
worthless.
