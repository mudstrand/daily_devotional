Today's Verses: Psalms 23:2-3 

He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. 

3 He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's
sake. 

Today's Thoughts:

When we allow God, our shepherd, to guide us, we have contentment.

When we choose to sin and go our own way, we cannot blame God for 

the environment we have created for ourselves. Our Shepherd knows the 

"green meadows" and "peaceful streams" that will restore us. We will reach 

these places only by flowing Him obediently. Rebelling against the Shepherds


leading is actually rebelling against our own best interests. 



We must remember this the next time we are tempted to go our own way rather 

than the Shepherds way. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, help me remember the next time I decide to go my own way-

that You have a better way-forgive me for often choosing another way. . .
Amen.
