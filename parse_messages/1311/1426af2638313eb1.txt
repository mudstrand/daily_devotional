Today's Verses: Ps. 25:1-2

To you, O Lord, I lift up my soul. 2 O my God, in you I trust;

let me not be put to shame; let not my enemies exult over me.

Today's Thoughts:

Seventy-two Psalms-almost half the book-speak about enemies.

Enemies are those who oppose not only us, but also God's way of living.

Give this some thought-we can view temptations-money-success-

prestige-lust-as our enemies. . . Of course Satan is our greatest enemy



David asked God to keep his enemies from overcoming him because they 

opposed what God stood for. If his enemies succeeded, David feared that 

many would think that trusting God was futile.



We too should not want our enemies' success to be an obstacle to the faith
of others.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, I am aware of the fact that I have many of these enemies-I pray that


I would be sensitive to Your Spirit's guidance so that my enemies would not 

triumph over me. . . In Jesus name, Amen.
