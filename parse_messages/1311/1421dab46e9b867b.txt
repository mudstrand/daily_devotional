Today's Verses: Ps. 21:1, 6

1 How the king rejoices in your strength, O Lord! He shouts with joy because
You give him victory. 

6 You have endowed him with eternal blessings and given him the joy of Your
presence.

Today's Thoughts:

In vs. 1-6 David described all that he had as gifts from God: his heart's
desire-

success and prosperity-a crown of fine gold-long life-splendor and majesty-

eternal blessing-and joy. 

We, too, must look upon all that we have-position-family-wealth-talent-

as a gift from God. Only then will we use them to give glory back to Him.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, help me remember every day is a gift from You and

all that I have is only possible because You sustain me down to the air that

I breathe. Help me to use the gifts I have received to give glory to You. .
. Amen.





Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

There is no one righteous, not even one. Ro. 3:10



The Christian church is not a congregation of righteous people. 

It is a society of those who know they are not good.

(Dwight E. Stevenson)
