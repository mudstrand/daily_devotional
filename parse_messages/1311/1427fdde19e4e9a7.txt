Today's Verses: Ps. 25:14-15

The Lord advises those who fear him. He reveals to them the intent of his
promise. 
15 My eyes are always on the Lord. He removes my feet from traps.

Today's Thoughts:

"Friendship with the Lord is reserved for those who fear Him." God offers
intimate 

and lasting friendship to those who revere Him, who hold Him in highest
honor. 

What relationship could ever compare with having the Lord of all creation
for a friend?

Your everlasting friendship will grow as you revere Him. 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, I pray that I would always be sensitive to Your Spirit's advice so
that 

I might receive the intent of Your promises. Guide my feet so that I would
not 

fall into the traps of this world. . . Amen.

Under the shadow of earthly disappointment, all 

unconscious to ourselves, our Divine Redeemer 

is walking by our side. . . . . . (E. H. Chapin)
