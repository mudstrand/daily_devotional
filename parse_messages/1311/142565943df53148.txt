Today's Verses: Ps. 23:5, 6

5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my
head with oil; my cup overflows. 

6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I
shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever. 

Today's thoughts:

God offers protection even when the enemies surround us. This is the final
scene of this psalm-

We see that the believers will dwell with God. God, will be the perfect
shepherd and the perfect host

who promises to guide and protect us throughout our life and to bring us
into His house-where 

a place has already been prepared for us (Jn. 14:2)

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord help me every day to experience the joy of doing things for You. 

O Lord allow nothing to discourage me nor rob me of the joy which is put 

into my heart by Your Holy Spirit. . . Amen.
