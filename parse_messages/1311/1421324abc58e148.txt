Today's Verses: Ps. 20:6-7 (NLT)

6 Now I know that the Lord rescues his anointed king. He will answer him
from his holy heaven and rescue him by his great power.

7 Some nations boast of their chariots and horses, but we boast in the name
of the Lord our God. 

Today's Thoughts:

The number of David's opponents meant nothing as long as he was on the
Lord's side.

Victory is "not by force nor by strength, but by the Spirit, says the Lord
Almighty.



Are you on the Lord's side? You may never face an enemy army, but the
battles you

face every day can be won with the Lord's strength. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, you know that I have never faced an enemy army-but I need your
strength

to win my battles against Satan, the world, and my own flesh. . . Amen.

If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation;

The old has gone, the new has come. (2 Cor. 5:17) NIV
