Today's Verses: Ps. 96:4, 5

4 I do not sit with men of falsehood, nor do I consort with hypocrites. 

5 I hate the assembly of evildoers, and I will not sit with the wicked. 

Today's Thoughts:

Should we stay away from unbelievers? No! Although there are-some
places 

Christians should avoid. Jesus demonstrated that we must go out among
unbelievers 

to help them. But remember there is a difference between being with
unbelievers and 

being one of them. Being one of them harms our witness for God. 



Ask yourself about the people you enjoy. "If I am with them often, will I
become less 

obedient to God in outlook or action?" If the answer is yes, carefully
monitor how you 

spend your time with these people and what effect it has on you. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, bless my sharing of Your powerful Word.

Use it to bring dead hearts to life and protect my

heart in the process. . . Amen.



Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

The finest test of Character is seen in the amount 

and the power of gratitude we have.
