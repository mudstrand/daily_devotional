Today's Verses: Ps. 25:3-4

Indeed, none who wait for you shall be put to shame; they shall be ashamed
who are wantonly treacherous.

4 Make me to know your ways, O Lord; teach me your paths. 

Today's Thoughts:

David wanted God's guidance-but how do we receive God's guidance? WELL the
very first step 

is to want to be guided and to realize that God's primary guidance system is
in His Word, the Bible 

Ps. 119 tells of the endless knowledge found in God's Word. . .



By reading it and constantly learning from it, we will gain the wisdom to
understand God's direction 

for our lives. We may be tempted to demand answers from God, but David asked
for direction. 

When we are willing to seek God, learn from His Word, and obey His commands,
then we will receive 

His specific guidance. 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, my prayer is that of David, "Make me know Your Ways-teach me Your
paths."

In Jesus Name. . . Amen.

In His great mercy He has given us new birth into a living hope.

Pet. 1:3 NIV



Optimism is the faith that leads to achievment.

Nothing can be done without hope.
