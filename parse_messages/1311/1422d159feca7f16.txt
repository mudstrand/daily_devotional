Today's Verse: Psalms 22:1 (NLT)

1 My God, my God, why have you abandoned me? 

Why are you so far away when I groan for help? 

Today's Thoughts:

David gave an accurate description of the suffering the Messiah would endure

hundreds of years later. David was obviously suffering some great trial, but

through his suffering, he like the Messiah to come gained victory.

The cry of the Messiah was not a cry of doubt, but an urgent appeal to God.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, great is Thy faithfulness unto me, help me to stand steadfast in

Your loving kindness with no doubts in my mind. Forgive me for any

questions that may come to mind when Your answers are slow in coming. . .
Amen 



Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

May my meditations be pleasing to him, as I rejoice in the Lord. . . Ps. 104
