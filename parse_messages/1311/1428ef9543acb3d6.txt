Today's Verses: Ps. 26:1-3

1 Vindicate me, O Lord, for I have walked in my integrity, and I have
trusted in the Lord without wavering. 

2 Prove me, O Lord, and try me; test my heart and my mind. 

3 For your steadfast love is before my eyes, and I walk in your
faithfulness. 

Today's Thought:

When David said, he had walked in integrity, he was not claiming to be
sinless-that is 

impossible for any human being. BUT he was consistently in fellowship with
God-

clearing his record when he sinned by asking for forgiveness. Here he pleads
with God 

to clear his name of false charges made against him by his enemies. . .

We too can ask God to examine us, trusting Him to forgive our sins and clear
our record

according to His mercy. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Thank You Lord, for the love that forgives me. Help me treasure it 

even though I cannot understand it. . . Amen.

In everything give thanks. (I Thess. 5:18)
