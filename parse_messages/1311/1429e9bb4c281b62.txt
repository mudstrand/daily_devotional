Today's Verses: Ps. 26:9-12

9 Do not sweep away my soul along with hardened sinners or my life along
with bloodthirsty people. 

10 Evil schemes are in their hands. Their right hands are full of bribes. 

11 But I walk with integrity. Rescue me, and have pity on me. 

12 My feet stand on level ground. I will praise the Lord with the choirs in
worship. 

Today's Thoughts:

How often have we complained about our problems to whoever would listen-

and praise God in private? O how much better it would be if we for us to
complain 

in private and praise God publicly. Let us remember today, from where our
blessing flow.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, keep me awake and watching for my Saviors return 

so I can follow Him to glory. . . Amen.



Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

Clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, 

God opposes the proud but give grace to the humble. I Pet 5:5
