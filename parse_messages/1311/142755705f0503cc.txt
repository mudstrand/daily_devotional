Today's Verses: Ps. 25:8-11

Good and upright is the Lord; therefore he instructs sinners in the way. 

9 He leads the humble in what is right, and teaches the humble his way. 

10 All the paths of the Lord are steadfast love and faithfulness, 

for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies. 

11 For your name's sake, O Lord, pardon my guilt, for it is great. 

Today's Thought:

How much thought do we put into the fact that we are bombarded every day 

with relentless appeals to go in various directions? TV advertising alone
places 

hundreds of options before us, in addition to appeals from political
parties-

cults-false religions and dozens of other groups. 

Numerous organizations, including Christian organizations, seek to motivate
us 

to support a cause. Add to that dozens of decisions we must make concerning 

our job, our family, our money, and our society, and we become desperate for


someone to show us the right way-If you find yourself pulled in several
directions, 

remember that God teaches the humble way, His way. . . 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, when I am pulled in several directions each day help to remember 

to ask myself-What Would Jesus Do-WWJD. So that the truth of Christ 

would be in me. . . Amen.

Worship the LORD with gladness; 
come before him with joyful songs. Psalm 100:2
