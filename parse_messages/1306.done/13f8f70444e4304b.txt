Today's Verse: Ps. 33:4



For the word of the Lord holds true, and we can trust everything He does. 

Today's Thoughts:

All of God's Words are true and trustworthy. The Bible is reliable because-

unlike people, God does not lie-forget-change his Words-or leave His
promises

unfulfilled. . .



We can trust the Bible because-it contains Words of a-holy-trustworthy-and

unchangeable God. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the reliability of Your Word-

I thank You that it is trustworthy-true-and unchanging. 

I thank You that You do not leave one promise unfulfilled.

Help me Lord to be true to Your word. . . Amen.



I will be leaving for Medora N. D. this morning ao there will not be any
Devos. 

Until Tue. Morning. . .
