Today's Verse: "We live unto the Lord." Romans 14:8
<http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ro+14%3A8> 



Today's Food For Thought:

If God had willed it, each of us might have entered heaven at the moment of
conversion. It was not absolutely necessary for our preparation for
immortality that we should tarry here. It is possible for a man to be taken
to heaven, and to be a partaker of the inheritance of the saints in light,
though he has but just believed in Jesus. It is true that our sanctification
is a long and continued process, and we shall not be perfected till we lay
aside our bodies and enter within the veil; but nevertheless, had the Lord
so willed it, He might have changed us from imperfection to perfection, and
have taken us to heaven at once. Why then are we here? Would God keep His
children out of paradise a single moment longer than was necessary? Why is
the army of the living God still on the battle-field when one charge might
give them the victory? Why are His children still wandering through a maze,
when a solitary word from His lips would bring them into the center of their
hopes in heaven? The answer is-they are here that they may "live unto the
Lord," and may bring others to know His love. We remain on earth as sowers
to scatter good seed; as ploughmen to break up the fallow ground; as heralds
publishing salvation. We are here as the "salt of the earth," to be a
blessing to the world. We are here to glorify Christ in our daily life. We
are here as workers for Him, and as "workers together with Him." Let us see
that our life answers its end. Let us live earnest, useful, holy lives, to
"the praise of the glory of His grace." Meanwhile we long to be with Him.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, help me in my walk to be a faithful-Sower-Ploughmen-Herald-

so that I may work with others in bring the lost to the fold. . .Amen.
