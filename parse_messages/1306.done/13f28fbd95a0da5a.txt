Today's Verse: Psalm 126:3
<http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ps+126%3A3> 

The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad."



Some Christians are sadly prone to look on the dark side of everything, and
to dwell more upon what they have gone through than upon what God has done
for them. 

If you ask for their impression of the Christian life, they will describe
their continual conflicts, their deep afflictions, their sad adversities,
and the sinfulness of their hearts, 

yet with scarcely any allusion to the mercy and help which God has
graciously given them. But a Christian whose soul is in a healthy state,
will come forward joyously, and say, "the Lord hath done great things for
me, I will speak, not about myself, but to the honor of my God. He hath
brought me up out of a horrible pit, and out of the miry clay, and set my
feet upon a rock, and established my goings: and He hath put a new song in
my mouth, even praises unto our God." 



Such an abstract of experience as this is the very best that any child of
God can present. Yes it is true that we endure trials, but it is just as
true that we are delivered out of them. It is true that we have our
corruptions, and sadly we know this, but it is quite as true that we have an
all-sufficient Savior, who overcomes these corruptions, and delivers us from
their control.
