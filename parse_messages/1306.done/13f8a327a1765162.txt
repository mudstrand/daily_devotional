Today's Verses: Heb. 12:2

"Looking unto Jesus, the champion who initiates and perfects our faith." 



Today's Thoughts:

It is forever the Holy Spirit's work to turn our eyes away from self to
Jesus; but Satan's work is just the opposite of this, for he is constantly
trying to make us regard ourselves instead of Christ. He insinuates, "Your
sins are too great for pardon-you have no faith-you do not repent enough-you
will never be able to continue to the end-you do not have the joy of His
children-you have such a wavering hold of Jesus." 

All these are thoughts about self, and we shall never find comfort or
assurance by looking within. But the Holy Spirit turns our eyes entirely
away from self: He tells us that we are nothing-but that "Christ is all in
all." Remember, it is not your hold of Christ that saves you-it is Christ-it
is not your joy in Christ that saves you-it is Christ-it is not even faith
in Christ-though that is the instrument-it is Christ's blood and merits; so,
look not so much to your hand with which you are grasping Christ, as to
Christ-look not to your hope, but to Jesus, the source of your hope-look not
to your faith, but to Jesus, the author and finisher of your faith. We will
never find happiness by looking at our prayers-our works-or our feelings-it
is what Jesus is, not what we are, that gives rest to the soul. If we would
at once overcome Satan and have peace with God-it must be by "looking to
Jesus." Keep your eye simply on Him-let His death-His sufferings-His
merits-His glories-His intercession-be totally on your mind-when you wake
in the morning look to Him-when you lie down at night look to Him. DON'T!
let your hopes or fears come between you and Jesus; follow Him, with all
your mite, and He will never fail you.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, I pray that I would always be sensitive to Your Holy Spirit's
leading.

Bind Satin's attempts to draw my eyes from You to myself, for without You I
am

nothing. Help me cling to the path that leads to eternal life. . .Amen.
