Today's Verse: 2Timothy 1:9
<http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Ti+1%3A9> "Who hath saved us,
and called us with an holy calling." 

Today's Lesson:

The apostle uses the perfect tense and says, "Who hath saved us." Believers
in Christ Jesus are saved. They are not looked upon as persons who are in a
hopeful state, and may ultimately be saved, but they are already saved.
Salvation is not a blessing to be enjoyed upon our dying bed, and to be sung
of in a future state above, but a matter to be obtained, received, promised,
and enjoyed now. The Christian is perfectly saved in God's purpose; God has
ordained him unto salvation, and that purpose is complete. He is saved also
as to the price which has been paid for him: "It is finished" was the cry of
the Savior before He died. The believer is also perfectly saved in His
covenant head, for as he fell in Adam, so he lives in Christ. This complete
salvation is accompanied by a holy calling. Those whom the Savior saved upon
the cross are in due time effectually called by the power of God the Holy
Spirit unto holiness: they leave their sins; they endeavor to be like
Christ; they choose holiness, not out of any compulsion, but from the stress
of a new nature, which leads them to rejoice in holiness just as naturally
as before they delighted in sin. God neither chose them nor called them
because they were holy, but He called them that they might be holy, and
holiness is the beauty produced by His workmanship in them. The excellences
which we see in a believer are as much the work of God as the atonement
itself. Which is brought out very sweetly in the fullness of the grace of
God. Salvation must be of grace, because the Lord is the author of it: and
what motive but grace could move Him to save the guilty? Salvation must be
of grace, because the Lord works in such a manner that our righteousness is
forever excluded. Such is the believer's privilege-a present salvation; such
is the evidence that he is called to it-a holy life.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, accomplish Your will in me. Strengthen my resolve to serve You
more faithfully.

Help me to overcome all sluggishness to worship you and all indifference to
Your Word.

Help me again to dedicate myself again to Your Son Jesus Christ, who rose
again from the

Dead and lives forever more. . . Amen.
