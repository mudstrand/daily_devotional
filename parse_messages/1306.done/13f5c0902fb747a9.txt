Today's Verse: Acts 2:4 <http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ac+2%3A4>
"And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit."

Today's Lesson:

Rich were the blessings of this day if all of us were filled with the Holy
Spirit. The consequences of this sacred filling of the soul would be
impossible to overestimate. Life-comfort-light-purity-power-peace-and many
other precious blessings are inseparable from the Spirit's gracious
presence. As sacred oil, He anoints the head of the believer, sets him apart
to the priesthood of saints, and gives him grace to execute his office
rightly. As the only truly purifying water He cleanses us from the power of
sin and sanctifies us unto holiness, working in us to will and to do the
Lord's good pleasure. As the light, He manifested to us at first our lost
estate, and now He reveals the Lord Jesus to us and in us, and guides us in
the way of righteousness. 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, I pray that Your Holy Spirit, would cleanse my heart from

all thoughts of hate-of envy-and help me to live peaceably with all

people. Make me more helpful-kind-and considerate that I may live

my life for you and for others. . . Amen.
