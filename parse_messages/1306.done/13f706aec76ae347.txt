Today's Verse: 2 Chron 7:14 

If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and
seek my face and turn from their wicked ways,

I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and restore their land. 



Today's thoughts:

In chapter 6 we see that Solomon had asked God to make provisions for the
people when they sinned.

God answered with four conditions for forgiveness-

(1) Humble yourself by admitting your sins.

(2) Pray to God asking for forgiveness.

(3) Seek God continually.

(4) Turn from sinful behavior.

We need to remember that true repentance is more than mere talk-

It is a changed behavior. . .



Whether we sin individually, as a group, or as a nation-

Following these steps will lead to forgiveness-God will answer our earnest
prayers. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, whatever activities come my way, give me the wisdom to recognize 

what is evil before I become ensnared in it. Grant me the strength to resist

every temptation to sin. Let me never be ashamed to say, "How can I do this

great wickedness and sin against God?" Amen.
