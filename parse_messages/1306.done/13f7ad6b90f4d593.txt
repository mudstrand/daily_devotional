Today's Verse: Matt 6:25

I tell you not to worry about everyday life-whether you have enough food and
drink, or enough clothes to wear. 

Isn't life more than food, and your body more than clothing?



Today's Thoughts: 

Because of the ill effects of worry, Jesus tells us not the worry about
those needs

God has promised to supply.

Worry may:

(1) Damage your health.

(2) Disrupt your productivity.

(3) Negatively effect the way you treat others-and-

(4) Reduce your ability to trust God. . .



How many ill effects of worry are you experiencing? ? ?

Here is the difference between worry and genuine concern:

Worry immobilizes-BUT-concerns moves people to action. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord Jesus, You are my strength and my hope.

Without You I am nothing-but all things are possible

for those who trust in You. Give me the grace to see my 

sins and confess them to You. . . Amen.
