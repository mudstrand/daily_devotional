Today's Verse: "Thy Redeemer." Isaiah 54:5
<http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Isa+54%3A5> 

Today's Lesson:

Jesus, the Redeemer, is altogether ours and ours forever. All the offices of
Christ are held on our behalf. He is king for us, priest for us, and prophet
for us. Whenever we read a new title of the Redeemer, let us appropriate Him
as ours under that name as much as under any other. The shepherd's staff,
the father's rod, the captain's sword, the priest's mitre, the prince's
septer, the prophet's mantle, all are ours. Jesus hath no dignity which He
will not employ for our exaltation, and no prerogative which He will not
exercise for our defense. His fullness of Godhead is our unfailing,
inexhaustible treasure-house. His manhood also, which he took upon himself
for us, is ours in all its perfection. To us our gracious Lord communicates
the spotless virtue of a stainless character; to us he gives the meritorious
efficacy of a devoted life; on us he bestows the reward procured by obedient
submission and incessant service. He makes the glittering virtues of his
character our ornaments and jewels; and the superhuman meekness of his death
our boast and glory. He bequeaths us his manger, from which to learn how God
came down to man; and his Cross to teach us how man may go up to God. All
His thoughts, emotions, actions, utterances, miracles, and intercessions,
were for us. He trod the road of sorrow on our behalf, and hath made over to
us as his heavenly legacy the full results of all the labors of his life.
Christ everywhere and every way is our Christ, for ever and ever most richly
to enjoy. O my soul, by the power of the Holy Spirit! call him this morning,
"thy Redeemer."

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your care and protection-for the
health and strength

That I will need for the work of this day. Protect Your children everywhere.
. . Amen.
