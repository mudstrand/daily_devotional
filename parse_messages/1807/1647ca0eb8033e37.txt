VERSE FOR TODAY:

_Even the depths of Death and Destruction are known by the Lord._

_How much more does He know the human heart! _(Pro. 15:11)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

Have you ever felt far from God, separated by feelings of failure

and personal problems? Remember God stands ready to hear His

people, to forgive their sins, and restore their relationship with

Him. God is waiting and listening for our confession of guilt and

our RE-commitment to obey Him. He hears us when we pour out

our needs and problems to Him and is ready to forgive us and

restore us to fellowship with Him. Don't wait to experience His

loving forgiveness. . .

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Lord, forgive me when I forget to ask that I would be restored

to a better relationship with You, when I have drifted far from You

by the busyness of this life. . . Amen.
