VERSE FOR TODAY:

_A glad heart makes a happy face; a broken heart crushes the_

_spirit. _(Pro. 15:13)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

Wisdom is the ability to see life from God's perspective and then
will

know the best course of action to take. Most people would agree that

wisdom is a valuable asset, but how can we acquire it? Pro. 9:10

teaches that the fear of the Lord (respect and honor) is the
beginning of

wisdom. Wisdom comes from knowing and trusting God, it is not merely

the way to find God. God will lead to understanding and then sharing
this

knowledge with others.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Lord, of all wisdom and knowledge, instill in me some of your

godly wisdom so that I might see life from Your perspective and

then be able to know the course of action to take that will be
pleasing

to You. . . Amen.
