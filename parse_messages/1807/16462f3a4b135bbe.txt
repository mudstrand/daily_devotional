VERSE FOR TODAY:

_Godliness exalts a nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people.
_(Pro. 14:34)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

(_Righteousness exalts a nation_) Here we have a reminder aimed
especially

at rulers and other public servants, that their good example is
beneficial to the

entire nation. Their sin, likewise, affects and disgraces all who
live under

their rule, My main thought here, is I wonder if other nations think
that all

citizens in this country can not be trusted because of the behavior
of the

leaders of this country?

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that other nations would not loose their
trust

in this nation because of the disgraceful behavior of our leaders. I
pray that

our leaders would be convicted by Your Holy Spirit so that they would
turn

form their sinful ways. . . Amen
