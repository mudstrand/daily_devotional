01/16/2011~~~food for thought~~~THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"[Dispute Over Whose Children Jesus' Opponents Are] To the Jews 
who had believed him, Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching, you are 
really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set 
you free."" - John 8:31-32 

Our Lesson for Today:
Jesus is speaking to those who's belief in Him is superficial, what 
Jesus is saying is that discipleship means accepting all of His 
teaching and to remain faithful to it. . .

Only in Jesus and His teaching will anyone be free from sin, death, 
and Satan's rule, and so be free to serve God with a pure heart. 
In contrast Judaism taught that the study of God's Law made a 
person free. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, grant that I may remain faithful to Your Word 
until my last hour. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
