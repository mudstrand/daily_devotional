01/09/2011~~~food for thought~~~ALWAYS SEEK TO DO YOUR BEST

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Seek good, not evil, that you may live. Then the LORD God Almighty will be with you, 
just as you say He is. Hate evil, love good; maintain justice in the courts. Perhaps the LORD 
God Almighty will have mercy on the remnant of Joseph." - Amos 5:14-15 

Our Lesson for Today:
Vs. 14 has very good advice if we want eternal life ~ "Seek good, not evil."
Of course we also need to remember that we are not saved by good works,
but good works should follow faith in what Christ has done for us.
The second promise is obviously what each of us are looking for, "The Lord's
personal presence with us. . .

We need to realize that this text was directed toward the "remnant of Joseph."

But If we do not examine closely, past history, we will fall to the same mistakes. 

Prayer Suggestion:
Lord have mercy on us, sensitize us to the these warnings. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." 

ohn: 14:6
