Today is International Disturbed People's Day

Please send an encouraging message to a disturbed friend... Just as I've done. 


I don't care if you lick windows, Take the special bus Or occasionally pee on yourself.. You hang in there sunshine, you're special. 

Every sixty seconds you spend angry, upset or mad, is a full minute of happiness you'll never get back.. 

Today's Message of the Day is:

Life is short, Break the rules, Forgive quickly, Kiss slowly, Love truly, Laugh uncontrollably, And never regret anything that made you smile.


Send to all the people you care for and don't want to lose in 2011, even me. If you get 3 back, you are a great friend.
