01/28/2011~~~food for thought~~~ALWAYS SEEK TO FOLLOW THE LIGHT

Our Bible Verse for Today:
John 8:
Dispute Over Jesus' Testimony
12 When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, 
"I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will 
never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life." 

Our Lesson for Today:
In this day and age it is hard to believe, that occasionally I'm
asked "what does it mean to follow Christ?"

As a soldier follows his captain ~ like that we should follow
Christ, our commander. ~ As a slave follows his master ~ so 
we should follow Christ, or Lord. ~ As we follow the advice of 
a trusted consoler, we should follow Jesus' commands to us 
in Scripture. As we follow the laws of our nation, so we should
follow the laws of the Kingdom of Heaven, and you will never 
walk in darkness. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Lead me, Lord Jesus, to hear the full message of Your Word. . . Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather
The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
