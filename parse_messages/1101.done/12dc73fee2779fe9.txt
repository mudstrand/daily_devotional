01/27/2011~~~food for thought~~~TRUE HUMILITY BRINGS REPENTANCE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up." - James 4:10 

Our Lesson for Today:
Bowing before the Lord means recognizing that our worth comes from God alone.
To be "humbled" involves leaning on His power and guidance, and not going
our own independent way. . .

Even though we do not deserve God's favor, He wants to lift us up and give us
worth and dignity, despite our human shortcomings. . .

After our repentance comes God's forgiveness, new life, and the crown of 
life. (Jm. 1:12). Jesus teaches that those who humble themselves before
God will be exalted (Lk. 18:14).

Prayer Suggestion:
"Create in me a clean heat, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from Your presence, and take not Your Spirit from 
me. restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and uphold me with a 
willing spirit." (Ps. 51:10-12). . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
