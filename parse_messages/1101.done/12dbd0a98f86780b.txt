Veterans - Santa Barbara
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
The first picture and the last picture are taken at 
The beach in Santa Barbara right next to the pier. 
There is a veterans group that started putting a cross 
And candle for every death in Iraq and Afghanistan . 



The amazing thing is that they only do it on the weekends. 
They put up this graveyard and take it down every 
Weekend. Guys sleep in the sand next to it and keep 
Watch over it at night so nobody messes with it. 
Every cross has the name, rank and D.O.B. And D.O.D. 
On it.




Very moving, very powerful??? So many young volunteers. 
So many 30 to 40 year olds as well. 
Amazing !



Did you know that the ACLU has filed a suit to have 
All military cross-shaped headstones removed?
And another suit to end prayer from the military completely. 
They're making great progress. 
The Navy Chaplains can no longer mention Jesus' name in 
Prayer thanks to the ACLU and our new administration.

I'm not breaking this one.

If I get it a 1000 times, 
I'll forward it a 1000 times!

Please, let us pray...

Please send this on after a short prayer. Prayer for our 
Soldiers Don't break it!

Prayer: 
'Heavenly Father, hold our troops in Your loving hands. 
Protect them as they protect us Bless them and their 
Families for the selfless acts they perform for us in this 
Our time of need. These things I humbly ask in the name 
Of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior, 
Amen.'


GOD BLESS YOU FOR PASSING IT ON!
