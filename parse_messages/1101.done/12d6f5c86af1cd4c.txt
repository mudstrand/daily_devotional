Our Bible Verse for Today:
"[Treasures in Heaven] "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, 
where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do 
not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your 
treasure is, there your heart will be also." - Matthew 6:19-21 

Our Lesson for Today:
Storing up "Treasures in heaven," is not limited to tithing but is accomplished
by all acts of obedience to God. ~ There is a sense in which giving our money
to God's work is like investing in heaven. . .

But we should seek to please God not only in our giving but also in fulfilling 
God's purpose in all we do. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to become more sensitive to all the 
purposes You would want me to accomplish. . . Amen

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
