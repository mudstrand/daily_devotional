01/17/2011~~~food for thought~~~WALK WORTHY OF YOUR CALLING

Bible Verse for Today:
"So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify 
the desires of the flesh." - Galatians 5:16 

Our Lesson for Today:
Paul says: "walk" What he means is "be in line with," or "Keep in step,"
"Walk," is a common term that can describe one's life or way of life. . .

Paul's warning is because as soon as we receive the Holy Spirit in baptism,
a life long struggle with the old Adam begins. This becomes quiet clear in 
vs. 17. . .

When we are led by the Spirit, it is not by coercion but by a gentle and loving
grasp. Its like when a child puts its hand into the hand of a beloved and trusted
father. . . 

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, by Your Holy Spirit, give me daily victories over sin
in my life and, above all, the power to love my neighbor. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
