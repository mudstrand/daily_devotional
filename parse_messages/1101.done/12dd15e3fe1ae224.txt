Our Bible Verse for Today:
"God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in 
the spirit and in truth."" - John 4:24 

Our Lesson for Today:
"God is spirit" The fact that God's essential nature is spiritual,
not material, reinforces the teaching that people should worship
"with the inclinations of the heart and by faith. . .

Both the father is spirit and the Son is spirit, and the Father is holy
and the Son is holy. ~ [The Holy Spirit] is referred both to the Father 
and to the Son, because the Holy Spirit is the Spirit both of the
Father and the Son. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus give to me a full measure of Your Spirit,
that I may always remain faithful to You and bear witness 
to You. . .Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
