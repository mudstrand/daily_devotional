01/15/2011~~~food for thought~~~CHRIST-LIKE LOVE HAS NO LIMITS

Bible Verse for Today:
"Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever 
does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, 
whom they have not seen. And he has given us this command: Anyone who loves 
God must also love their brother and sister." - 1 John 4:20-21 

Our Lesson for Today:
It is easy to say we love God when it does not cost us anything more than 
weekly attendance at a religious service. But the real test of our love for God 
is how we treat our family members and fellow believers this includes even 
the people we come into contact with each and every day. . .

We cannot truly love God while neglecting to love those who are created in
His image. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, I have not always loved my fellow 
Christians as I should. Forgive me and work Your love in 
me to cast out my fear of punishment. . . Amen 

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
