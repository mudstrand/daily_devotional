Today's Verses: Ps. 33:2-3

Praise the Lord with melodies on the lyre; make music for him on the
ten-stringed harp.

3 Sing a new song of praise to him; play skillfully on the harp, and sing
with joy. 

Today's Thoughts:

People from every nation are praising God before His throne. God's message
of 

salvation and eternal life is not limited to a specific culture race or
country. 

Anyone who comes to God in repentance and faith is accepted by Him and will 

be part of His kingdom. Don't allow prejudice or bias keep you from sharing 

Christ with others. Christ welcomes all people who come believing into His
Kingdom.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, fill me with thankfulness and awe each time I hear the message 

of your salvation. Create in me a heart for the lost no matter the color 

of their skin. . . Amen.
