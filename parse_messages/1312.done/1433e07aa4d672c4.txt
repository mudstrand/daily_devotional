Today's Verses: Ps. 34:11-14

11 Come, my children, and listen to me, and I will teach you to fear the
Lord.

12 Does anyone want to live a life that is long and prosperous?

13 Then keep your tongue from speaking evil and your lips from telling lies!

14 Turn away from evil and do good. Search for peace, and work to maintain
it. 

Today's Thoughts:

Have you notice how the Bible connects the fear of the Lord (love and
reverence) with obedience?

"Fear God and obey His commandments" Eccl. 12:13. "All those who love Me
will do what I say" (Jn. 14:23)

David said a person who fears the Lord doesn't lie, turns from evil, does
good, and promotes peace.

Reverence is much more then sitting quietly in church. It includes obeying
God in the way we speak 

and in the way we treat others. 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord I pray that I would always have a teachable spirit. Bridle my
tongue 

so that I would not utter any evil words. Help me to always seek to live in
peace 

with my neighbor. Amen
