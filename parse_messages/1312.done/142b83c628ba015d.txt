Today's Verses: Ps. 28:1-5

O Lord, I call to you. O my rock, do not turn a deaf ear to me. If you
remain silent, I will be like those who go into the pit. 

2 Hear my prayer for mercy when I call to you for help, when I lift my hands
toward your most holy place. 

3 Do not drag me away with wicked people, with troublemakers who speak of
peace with their neighbors but have evil in their hearts. 

4 Pay them back for what they have done, for their evil deeds. Pay them back
for what their hands have done, and give them what they deserve. 

5 The Lord will tear them down and never build them up again, because they
never consider what he has done or what his hands have made. 

Today's Thoughts:

God is our only real source of safety-Prayer is our best help when trials
come our way-

because it keeps us in communion with God. It is easy to pretend friendship.
Wicked people 

often put on a show of kindness or friendship in order to gain their own
ends.

BUT true believers should be straight-forward and sincere in all their
relationships. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, You are my rock of safety, protect me from Satan's skims 

so that I may walk according to Your will. . .Amen.
