Today's Verse: Ps. 34:8

Taste and see that the Lord is good. Oh, the joys of those who take refuge
in him!

Today's Thoughts:

"Taste and see" does not mean, "Check out God's credentials."

Instead it is an invitation: "Try this, I know you will like it."

When we take that first step of obedience in following God, we cannot help 

discovering that He is good and kind. When we begin the Christian life, our 

knowledge of God is incomplete. But as we trust Him more each day, we will 

experience how good He truly is. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, Help me remember to place my hand in Yours each day

so that I would not stray from Your will, but would remain faithfully on the
path, 

You would have me follow. . . Amen
