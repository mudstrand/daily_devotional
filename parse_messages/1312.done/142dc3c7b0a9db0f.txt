Today's Verses: Ps. 31:5-6

Into your hand I commit my spirit; you have redeemed me, O Lord, faithful
God.

6 I hate those who pay regard to worthless idols, but I trust in the Lord. 

Today's thoughts:

We often say that we have faith in God-but do we fully trust Him.

David say, "Into your hand I commit my spirit," this truly conveys his trust
in God the Father.

Stephen repeated these words as he was being stoned to death, confident that
in his death he 

was simply passing from God's earthly care to God's eternal care. We should
commit our 

possessions, our families, and our vocations to God. But first and foremost,
we should 

commit ourselves completely to Him.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, fix my faith on You so that I would have complete 

confidence in You in the midst of life's trials. . . Amen.
