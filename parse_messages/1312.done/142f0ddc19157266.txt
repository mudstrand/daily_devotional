Today's Verses: Ps. 32:1, 2

Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. 

2 Blessed is the man against whom the Lord counts no iniquity, and in whose
spirit there is no deceit. 

Today's Thoughts:

God wants to forgive sinners-forgiveness has always been a part of His
loving nature.

He announced this to Moses (Ex. 34:6, 7). He revealed it to David-and He
dramatically 

showed it to the world through Jesus Christ. These verses convey several
aspects of God's forgiveness.

He forgives rebellion, puts sin out of sight, and clears our record of sin.

Paul quoted these verses in Ro 4:7, 8 and showed that we can have the same
joyous experience 

of forgiveness through faith in Jesus Christ.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Thank You Lord, for Your loving nature-and forgiving Spirit, thank You for 

freeing me from sin's heavy weight and for heaven's glory. . .Amen.

Blessed is the man against whom the Lord counts no iniquity.



God is better served in resisting a temptation to evil

Than in many formal prayers.
