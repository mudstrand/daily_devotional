Today's Verses: Ps. 34:18, 19

The Lord is close to the brokenhearted; he rescues those whose spirits are
crushed. 
19 The righteous person faces many troubles, but the Lord comes to the
rescue each time. 

Today's Thoughts:

I believe we all often wish we could escape troubles-the pain of grief, 

loss, sorrow, and failure, or even small daily frustrations that constantly 

wear us down. God promises to be "close to the brokenhearted" and to be 

our source of power, courage, and wisdom, helping us through problems.

Sometimes He chooses to deliver us from those problems. When trouble 

strikes don't get frustrated with God. Instead, admit that you need His 

help and thank Him for being by your side. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, I do thank You for the many times You have spared me 

from many trials. I thank You for all the times you have given me 

the strength to handle those daily frustrations. . . In Jesus name. . .
Amen.



Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

Praise the Lord for His goodness.
