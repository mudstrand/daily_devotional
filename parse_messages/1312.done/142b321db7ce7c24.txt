Today's Verses: Ps. 27:13-14

13 I believe that I will see the goodness of the Lord in this world of the
living. 
14 Wait with hope for the Lord. Be strong, and let your heart be courageous.
Yes, wait with hope for the Lord. 

Today's Thoughts:

The "land of the living" simply means this life. David was obviously going
through some trial-but 

he was confident that in this present life, God would see him through it. He
knew from experience 

what it meant to wait for the Lord. He had been anoint king at the age of 16
but did not become king 

until he was 30. During the interim he was chased through the wilderness by
jealous King Saul. 

David had to wait on God for the fulfillment of his promise to reign. After
becoming king he was 

chased by his rebellious son Absalom.

Often it seems that God isn't answering our prayers or doesn't understand
the urgency of our situation. 

That kind of thinking implies that God is not in control or is not fair. BUT
God is worth waiting for. 

Make good use of your waiting times by discovering what God may be trying to
teach you in them. . .

Today's prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, teach me patience and show me that I can take You 

at Your word whenever You speak. Amen
