Today's Verses: Ps. 32: 8, 9

8 The Lord says, "I will guide you along the best pathway for your life. I
will advise you and watch over you.

9 Do not be like a senseless horse or mule that needs a bit and bridle to
keep it under control." 

Today's Thoughts:

The Lord describes some people as being like a horse or mule that needs to
be controlled 

by a bit and bridle. Rather then letting God guide them step by step they
stubbornly leave 

God only one option. If God wants to keep them useful for Him, He must use
discipline and 

punishment. God longs to guide us with love and wisdom rather than
punishment. He offers 

to teach us the best way to go. Accept the advice written in God's Word, and
don't let your 

stubbornness keep you from obeying God's Word.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, teach me the best way to go and fill my days with 

the happiness of knowing You have forgiven my sins in Jesus. . . Amen.
