Today's Verses: Ps. 33:16, 17

The best-equipped army cannot save a king, nor is great strength enough to
save a warrior.

Don't count on your warhorse to give you victory- for all its strength, it
cannot save you. 

Today's Thoughts:

"Warhorse" refers to military strength. What is being said is that because
God rules and 

overrules every nation, leaders should never put their trust in their
physical power. 

Military strength is not the basis for our hope. Our hope is in the Lord and
in His gracious 

offer to save us if we will trust in Him. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, help me to always place my trust in You-because 

You are my rock and my salvation. . . Amen.

Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

The message of Christmas is that this visible material world 

is bound to the invisible spiritual world.
