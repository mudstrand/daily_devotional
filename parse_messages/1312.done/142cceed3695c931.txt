Today's Verses: Ps 29:10-11

10 The Lord sits enthroned over the flood; the Lord sits enthroned as king
forever. 

11 May the Lord give strength to his people! May the Lord bless his people
with peace! 

Today's Thoughts:

All through history, God has revealed His power through miracles over
nature-such 

as the great flood. He promises to continue to reveal His power. The same
power that 

raised Christ from the dead is available to help us with our daily problems.
The same 

power that controls creation and raises the dead is available to you. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, help me to cast all my cares on You,

trusting that You care for me. . . Amen.

It is for freedom that Christ has set us free.
