Today's Verses: Ps. 34:15-17

15 The eyes of the Lord watch over those who do right; his ears are open to
their cries for help.

16 But the Lord turns his face against those who do evil; he will erase
their memory from the earth.

17 The Lord hears his people when they call to him for help. He rescues them
from all their troubles. 

Today's Thoughts:

The eyes and the ears of the Lord are always open to those who live
righteously, 

and no unrighteous act ever escapes God's eye either. (God turns His face
against those who do evil.)

In other words these people will face divine intervention. God is never
indifferent to the deeds of sinful man. 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Lord, help me carry everything to You in prayer with the confidence 

that is mine only in Jesus. . . Amen.

Be still and know that I am God. Ps. 46:10



The one thing we need is to know God better.
