I thought these deserved to be passed around...JR





Maxine on Jesus ----- This is so great, you will love it. 
I've always enjoyed Maxine but this is different than any I've seen before!
















If you believe in Jesus, send this out to everyone you care about. I just did !!!!

Live your life in such a way that when your feet hit the floor in the morning, Satan shudders & says...
“Oh no.... he's awake!!” 


This doesn't get around as much as the other Maxine cartoons. But, it should.
