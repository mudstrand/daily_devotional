VERSE FOR TODAY:

_I know that whatever God does is final. Nothing can be added to it_

_or taken from it. God's purpose is this that people should fear
Him._

(Ec. 3:14)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

So what is the purpose of life? It is that we should fear the
all-powerful

God. To FEAR God means to respect and stand in awe of Him because of

who He is. 'Purpose' in life starts with whom we know, NOT with what

we know or how good we are. It is IMPOSSIBLE to fulfill our God-given

purpose UNLESS we revere God and give Him first place in our life.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Lord, I thank You that everything was created by You with a
purpose.

I pray that you will forgive me for not living accordingly. I pray
that You

will forgive me for living selfishly and not thinking about the needs
of

others. . . Amen.
