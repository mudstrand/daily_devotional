VERSE FOR TODAY:

_I also noticed that throughout the world th__ere is evil in the
courtroom,_

_Yes even the courts of law are corrupt! _(Ec. 3:16)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

I don't thing I have to remind you of this fact that there is evil
and corruption

in the place where there should be justice. It even affects the legal
system.

Solomon asked how God's plan can be perfect when there is so much
injustice

and oppression in the world (4:1). He concluded that God does not
ignore

injustice but will bring it to an end at His appointed time
(12:13,14).

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Heavenly Father, we are seeing so much evil in our day. Because

of this, there are people who find it easy to not believe in You.
Help us

remember that this life is not all there is, so please forgive us
when we

pass judgment on You, because we do not know everything. Your plan

is to live with You forever, so help us to give thanks always. . .
Amen.
