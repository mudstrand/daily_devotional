VERSE FOR TODAY:

Solomon said _"I saw that there is nothing better for people than_

_to be happy in their work. That is why they are here! No one will_

_bring them back from death to enjoy life in the future."_

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

Independent of God's revelation, we cannot know the future. Even

when we are called into the majesty of heaven, it is unlikely that

we shall see what is after us, but in the midst of eternal
blessedness,

would we really care?

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Heavenly Father, we have not kept Your Law as we should.We

continually sin and fear death. We know through Your Holy Gospel

by faith that all Your merits are ours freely through Christ. Death

cannot harm us, for it will be swallowed up in victory. Praise be to

You, O Lord. . . Amen.
