06/18/2010~~~food for thought~~~JESUS ~ LIFE'S RICHEST PRIZE

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Then Peter said, "Silver and gold I do not have, but what I have I give
you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth walk." ... He jumped to his 
feet and began to walk...(Acts. 3:6, 8)

Our Lesson for Today:
While praying have you ever received more than you expected?
The man in our verse today was hoping for a coin and received a miracle.

With our natural eye we can't even see the greatest part of the miracle.
We can't see how the man's crippled heart was cleansed of sin and 
filled with faith...

Jesus and His forgiveness, Jesus and His love, Jesus and all His name
contains became the beggar's very own to have and to enjoy. No wonder 
he stayed close to Peter and John. He wasn't about to turn loose the ones 
who had brought him to the Savior ~ life's richest prize...

When we hold our tin cup up to God, are we looking for the very best He has 
to offer? The items we need for daily life are only pocket change from God.
The real money comes in the form of His forgiveness, peace, and eternal life.
He drops such riches into our cup through His Word and sacraments. Through
them He says again and again, "What I have, I give to you. And it's the best of all."

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, when I have You, I have life's richest prize.
Help me remember this...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
