06/23/2010~~~food for thought~~~KNOWLEDGE WHEN YOU NEED IT

Our Bible Verse for Today:
These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ,
the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name. (Jn. 20:31)

Our Lesson for Today:
We live in an information age. The modern world of technology places before us
so many facts, so much data, that no one can absorb it all. But even if we could, 
how would we remember it...

Education's goal is not to teach us everything but to teach us how to find what 
we need when we need it...

To understand the life and mission of Jesus more fully all we need to do is study 
the Gospels. John tells us that His Gospel records only a few of the many events
in Jesus' life on earth. But the Good News includes everything we need to know
to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, through whom we receive
eternal life...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord teach me to love Your sacred Word
and to view my Savior there...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
