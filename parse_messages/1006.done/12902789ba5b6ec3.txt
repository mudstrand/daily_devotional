06/04/2010~~~GOD'S GRACE ALONE

Our Bible Verses for Today:
For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith ~ and this is not from 
yourselves, it is the gift of God ~ not by works, so that no one can boast. (Eph. 2:8, 9)

Our lesson for Today:
How often have you heard the question, "How do I get to heaven?" That's not only a good
question to ask but one for which there is only one answer...

Paul sums up the answer with one word "grace." ~ God's grace is something completely 
undeserved, something I in no way earn or have coming. It is God's free gift. Paul emphasizes
this by writing, "By grace you have been saved."

It's not something I do but something done for me by God, through Christ Jesus' death on 
the cross. And just so I can't miss it he adds, "No one can boast." All praise belongs to God 
for my salvation...

Prayer Suggestion:
Gracious Lord Jesus, I humbly thank You for Your gift
of salvation. Help me treasure it always...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
