06/19/2010~~~food for thought~~~ KNOWING THE FACT...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Let us stop going over the basics of Christianity again and again.
Let us go on instead and become mature in our understanding.
Surely we don't need to start all over again with the importance of
turning away from evil deeds and placing our faith in God. ~ You
don't need further instruction about baptism, the laying on of hands,
the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. (Heb. 6:1-2)

Our Lesson for Today:
Certain elementary teachings are essential for all believers to understand.
Those basics include the importance of faith ~ the foolishness of trying to
be saved by good deeds ~ the meaning of baptism and spiritual gifts ~ AND
the facts of the resurrection and eternal life...

To go on to maturity in our understanding, we need to move beyond (but not away from)
the elementary teachings to a more complete understanding of faith.

Mature Christians should be teaching new Christians the basics. THEN ~ 
acting on what they know, the mature will lean even more from God's Word....

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me grow beyond the basics of Christianity
through a daily diet of Your Word...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
