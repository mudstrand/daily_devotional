06/27/2010~~~food for thought~~~JESUS ~ FRIEND OF SINNERS

Our Bible Verse for Today:
This man welcomes sinners and eats with them...(Lk. 15:2)

Our Lesson for Today:
He didn't just eat and drink with them. He died for them. Sin is sin in God's eyes.
No sin is greater than another. Though some sins are more heinous in our eyes 
because of their consequences on others, each sin weighs the same on God's 
scale...

And each sin deserves the same punishment. Sin cuts the sinner off from God,
it calls down His righteous anger, and condemns the sinner to an eternal hell.
Jesus came to pay for all sins of every sinner. He came for those mildly dusted 
with sin, if ever there could be such a sin. He came for those thickly coated with 
sin's dirt. ~ And thank God, He also came for me!

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, when I call You, "Friend of sinners," it's 
with gratitude and praise for being my friend...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to he father except through me." - John: 14:6
