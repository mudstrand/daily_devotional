: Stress

A lecturer, when explaining stress management to an audience, 
>raised a glass of water and asked, 'How heavy is this glass of water?'
> 
> Answers called out ranged from 20g to 500g.
> 
> The lecturer replied, 'The absolute weight doesn't matter.
> It depends on how long you try to hold it.
> If I hold it for a minute, it's not a problem.
> If I hold it for an hour, I'll have an ache in my right arm.
> If I hold it for a day, you'll have to call an ambulance.
> In each case, it's the same weight, 
> but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes.'
> 
> He continued,
> 'And that's the way it is with stress management. If we carry our burdens 
> all the time, sooner or later, the burden will become increasingly heavy: 
> and we won't be able to carry on. '
> 
> 'As with the glass of water, you have to put it down for a while and 
> rest before holding it again. 
> When we're refreshed, we can carry on with the burden.


> So, before you return home tonight, 
> put the burden of work down; 
> don't carry it home. 
> You can pick it up tomorrow. 
> Whatever burdens you're carrying now,
> let them down for a moment if you can.'
> 
> So, 
>my friend, 
> Put 
> down anything that may be a burden to you right now. 
> Don't pick it up again until after you've rested a while.


> Here 
>are some great ways of dealing with the burdens of life:
> * 
>Just accept that, some days, you're the pigeon: 
> and, some days, you're the statue.

* 
>Always keep your words soft and sweet - 
> just in case you have to eat them.

* 
>Each day wear stuff that will make you look good if you die in the middle of 
>it.
> * Drive carefully. 
> It's not only cars that can be "recalled" by their maker.

* 
>If you can't be kind, 
> at least have the decency to be vague.

* If 
>you lend someone $20 and never see that person again, 
> it was probably worth it.

* It 
> may be that your sole purpose in life 
> is simply to be kind to others.
> * Never put both feet in your mouth at the same time, 
> because then you won't have a leg to stand on.
> * Nobody cares if you can't dance well. Just get up and dance.
> * Since it's the early worm that gets eaten by the bird, 
> sleep late.
> * The second mouse gets the cheese.
> * 
> When everything's coming your way, 
> you're in the wrong lane.
> * Birthdays are good for you. 
> The more you have, the longer you live.
> * You may be only one person in the world, 
> but you may also be the world to one person.
> * Some mistakes are too much fun to only make once.
> * We could learn a lot from crayons... 
> Some are sharp; some are pretty; and some are dull. 
> Some have weird names; and all are different colors; 
> but they all have to live in the same box.
> *A truly happy person is one who can enjoy the scenery on a detour.

Have 
>an awesome day and know that someone has thought about you today...
> I did....
