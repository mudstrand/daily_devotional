06/24/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE WORLD'S GREATEST BRIDGE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"No one comes to the Father except through Me." (Jn. 14:6b)

Our Lesson for Today:
Earthly bridges have a way of crumbling into the dust. ~ Not this one.
Jesus stands till the end of time as the one way to the Father...

If you want to, you can charter a boat to ferry you across the Mackinac Straits,
or you can drive hundreds of miles around on land. ~ But there's no substitute
for God's bridge to heaven. 

"No one come to the Father except through Me," Jesus said. If we want to 
reach the shores of heaven, we must travel Jesus as the way...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, show me the way to heaven. Holy Spirit keep me in faith
in Jesus as the only way...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
