06/29/2010~~~food for thought~~~ JESUS ~ WISDOM

Our Bible Verse for Today:
You are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God ~ 
that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption...(I Cor. 1:30)

Our Lesson for Today:
Are you beginning to understand why the apostle Paul calls Jesus "wisdom from God"?

Jesus is our "redemption." He brought us back from sin's bondage.
He is our "righteousness." His payment for our sin and His perfect keeping of 
God's commandments enables us to stand unafraid before the heavenly judge.
He is our "holiness." When God looks at us, He no longer sees a hated sinner
but His dear child...

When God's grace leads us to Jesus, we're truly wise. 
Then we know what we need to know.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, teach me to know the Savior Jesus Christ.
Keep teaching me till I reach heaven's shores...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to The father except through me." - John: 14:6
