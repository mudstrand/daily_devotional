Our Bible Verse for Today:
He brought them out of darkness and the deepest gloom
and broke away their chains. Ps. 107:14

Our Lesson for Today:
Sin is like an anchor chain. Each sin is a heavy link in the chain.
One link is already enough to anchor me, not to some watery bottom, 
but to a never-ending hell.

Day after day I keep sinning, adding new links to my chain. Very often I don't
even feel the weight of my sins. What am I going to do? What kind of bolt
cutter or acetylene torch can I use to cut through the links and cast off sin's
heavy chain? I need to know!

The psalmist answers. Jesus has already cut me clear form my chains of sin.
God sent Him into this world to free me from guilt's despair and hell's darkness.

On the cross He said of sin's payment. "It is finished." From the grave He rose
to show that I'm free from death, the ultimate punishment for sin. 

Unchained ~ that's what I am! Navel vessels still have anchor chains.
But my chain of sin is gone...

Prayer Suggestion:
Thank You Lord Jesus, for freeing me from sin's
heavy weight and for heaven's glory...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
