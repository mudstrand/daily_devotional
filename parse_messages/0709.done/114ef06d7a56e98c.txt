A holy man was having a conversation with the Lord one day and said,
"Lord, I would like to know what Heaven and Hell are like."

The Lord led the holy man to two doors.

He opened one of the doors and the holy man looked in. In the middle of the

room was a large round table. In the middle of the table was a large pot of

stew, which smelled delicious and made the holy man's mouth water.

The people sitting around the table were thin and sickly. They appeared to 
be famished. They were holding spoons with very long handles that were 
strapped to their arms and each found it possible to reach into the pot of 
stew and take a spoonful.
But because the handle was longer than their arms, they could not get the 
spoons back into their mouths.

The holy man shuddered at the sight of their misery and suffering.

The Lord said, "You have seen Hell."

They went to the next room and opened the door. It was exactly the same as 
the first one. There was the large round table with the large pot of stew 
which made the holy man's mouth water. The people were equipped with the 
same long-handled spoons, but here
the people were well nourished and plump, laughing and talking. The holy 
man said, "I don't understand."

It is simple," said the Lord.
"It requires but one skill. You see they have learned to feed each other, 
while the greedy think only of themselves."

Remember that I will always share my spoon with you.
