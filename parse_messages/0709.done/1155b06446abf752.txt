GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought) Do not be wise in your own eyes, 
fear the Lord and shun evil. (Pro. 3:7)

Our Meditation for Today:

In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness.
We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit
Himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot
express.

And He who searches our hearts knows the mind of the 
Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in 
accordance with God's will...(Ro. 8:26, 27) NIV

The Lesson To Be Learned:

As a believer, you are not left to your own resources to cope with problems...

Even when you don't know the right words to pray, the Holy Spirit prays with
and for you, and God answers...

With God helping you pray, you don't need to be afraid to come before Him.

Ask the Holy Spirit to intercede for you "in harmony with God's own will."
Then when you bring your request to God, trust that He will always do
what is best...

Our Prayer for Today:
I thank You for the Holy Spirit's presence. I thank You for
His intercession on my behalf. I have to confess that there
have been many times that I just didn't have the words I
needed, to express myself as I had wished. I thank you that
I need not cope with my problems alone. I pray that my faith
will grow the the point that I will always trust that You will do
what is best...Amen

Keep looking up, He is only a prayer away...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
