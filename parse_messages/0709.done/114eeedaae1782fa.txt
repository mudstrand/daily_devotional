GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~No matter who we are only Jesus can set us free...

Our Meditation for Today:

Do you not know, brothers for I am speaking to men who know the law~
that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives?

For, example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long
as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage.

So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she is
called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law
and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man...(Jn. 7:1-3) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Paul uses marriage to illustrate our relationship to the law...

When a spouse dies, the law of marriage no longer applies.
Because we have died with Christ, the law can no longer condemn us.

Since we are united with Christ, His spirit enables us to produce good 
deeds for God. We now serve God, not by obeying a set of rules,
but out of renewed hearts and minds that overflow with love for Him...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I have so often strayed from Your
side, forgive me for this sin of returning to my old nature.
Renew a right spirit within me, cleanse me from all 
unrighteousness, I pray this in Jesus Name Amen...

Keep looking up, to the light...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
