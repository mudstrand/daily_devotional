GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Without Jesus there can be no hope...

Our Meditation for Today:
Therefore, there is no condemnation for those who
are in Christ Jesus...(Ro. 8:1) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

"Not guilty; let him go free." What would those words mean to you
if you were on death row?

The fact is that the whole human race is on death row, justly condemned
for repeatedly breaking God's holy law...

Without Jesus we would have no hope at all. But Thank God! He has 
declared us not guilty and has offered us freedom from sin and the power
to do His will...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for paying the price 
in full for my sins on the cross. I know that without You
I would have no hope. Help me to be sensitive to Your 
Holy Spirit's leading. I pray this in Jesus name...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is our only hope...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
