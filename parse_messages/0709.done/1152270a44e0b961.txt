GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~If we are still following our sinful nature we can never please God...

Our Meditation for Today:

Through Jesus Christ the law of the Spirit of life
set me free from the law of sin and death...(Ro 8:2) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Of course we know that the life-giving Spirit is the Holy Spirit...

As we see by (Gen. 1:2) he was present at the creation of the
world and he is the power behind the rebirth of every Christian...

He gives us the power we need to live the Christian life...

If you wish to learn more about the Holy Spirit see Jn. 3:6
Acts 1:3-5...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray for the filling of the Holy Spirit.
I pray that day by day I would become more sensitive and
obedient to His leading...Amen.

Keep looking up, for His guiding hand...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather...
