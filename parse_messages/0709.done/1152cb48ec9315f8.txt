GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Let the wise listen and add to their learning...

Our Meditation for Today:

Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds 
set on what nature desires; but those who live in accordance 
with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires.

The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled be the 
Spirit is life and peace...(Ro. 8:5, 6) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Paul divides people into two categories: those who let themselves be
controlled by their sinful nature, and those who follow after the Holy Spirit.

All of us would be in the first category, if Jesus wouldn't have offered 
us a way out...

Once we have said yes to Jesus, we will want to continue following Him,
because His way bring life and peace...

Daily we must consciously choose to center our life on God. Use the 
Bible to discover God's guidance, and then follow them...

In every perplexing situation ask yourself, What would Jesus want me
to do? When the Holy Spirit points out what is right, do it eagerly....

If you want more information on our sinful nature verses our new life
in Christ, review (Ro. 6:6-8; and turn to Eph. 4:22-24; Col. 3:3-15).

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, help me to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit,
so that I will follow His leading each and every day. I thank You
for the guidance of Your Word for daily living...Amen.

Keep looking up, He wants to be your guide...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
