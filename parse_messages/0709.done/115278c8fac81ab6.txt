GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge...

Our Meditation for Today:

For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by
the sinful nature, God did by sending His Son in the likeness of
sinful man to be a sin offering. And so He condemned sin in
sinful man,

in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully 
met in us, who do not live according to the sinful nature but 
according to the Spirit...

Our Thought for Today:

Yes Jesus gave Himself as a sacrifice for our sins.

In the Old Testament times, animal sacrifices were continually
offered at the temple. The sacrifices showed the Israelites the 
seriousness of sin~~

Blood had to be shed before sins could be pardoned...

The animal sacrifice could not really remove sin...
These sacrifices could only point to Jesus' sacrifice...
Which paid the penalty for all sins.

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the sacrifice You 
made for my sins. Forgive me for my sins today. Help
me to walk a more Christ-like walk...Amen.

Keep looking up, our salvation comes from above...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
