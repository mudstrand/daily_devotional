GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~The old flesh continues to lift it's ugly head...

Our Meditation for Today:

As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin 
living in me...

I know that noting good lives in me, that is, in my sinful
nature. For I have the desire to do good, but I cannot 
carry it out...

For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil
I do not want to do, this I keep on doing...

Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who
do it, but it is sin living in me that does it...(Ro. 7:17-20) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

How many times have you heard someone say, or even ourselves,
"The devil made me do it." "I didn't do it; the sin within me did it."

These sound like good excuses for sin, but we are responsible for 
our actions...

We must never use the power of sin or Satan as an excuse, 
because they are defeated enemies...

Without Christ's help, sin is stronger than we are, and sometimes
we are unable to defend ourselves against his attacks. That is why 
we should not stand up to temptation alone...

Jesus Christ who has conquered sin once for all, promises to fight
by our side. If we look to Him for help, we will not have to give in to sin...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Satan is forever prowling about 
like a roaring lion. I pray that You will remain by my side
so that I can stand fast against temptation. You are my
hiding place. I pray for good health and safety for all my
e-mail friends Amen....

Keep looking up, He is our help in all troubles...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
