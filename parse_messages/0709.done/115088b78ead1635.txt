GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Becoming a Christian does not stamp out all sin...

Our Meditation for Today:

I Do not understand what I do. for what I want to do
I do not do, but what I hate I do...(Ro. 7:15) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Being born again takes a moment of faith, but becoming like Christ
is a life-long process...

As Paul has been emphasizing since the beginning of this letter no
one in the world is innocent...

No one deserves to be saved, not the pagan who doesn't know 
God's laws, not the Christian or Jew who knows them and tries to 
keep them...

All of us must depend totally on the work of Christ for our salvation.
we can not earn it by our good behavior...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for my wayward ways.
Guide me in paths of righteousness for Your name sake...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is our guide and protector...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
