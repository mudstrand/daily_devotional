GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Our Christian hope is that one day we will live with the Lord...

Our Meditation for Monday:

Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will 
also live with Him.

For we know that since Christ was raised from the 
dead , He can not die again; death no longer has
mastery over Him..(Ro. 6:8, 9) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Because of Christ's death and resurrection, His followers
need never fear death. That assurance frees us to enjoy 
fellowship with Him and to do His will...

This will affect all our activities, work and worship, play, Bible
study, quiet times, and times of caring for others...

When you know that you do not have to fear death, you will
experience a new feel for life...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the gift of fellowship,
that I have with Jesus Christ. I thank You that death is no longer
something I need to fear...Amen.

Keep looking up, He seeks to have fellowship with you...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
