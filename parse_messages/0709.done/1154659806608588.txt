GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Wisdom will save you from the ways of the wicked...

Our Meditation for Today:

Those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God...

For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave
again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship.
And by Him we cry "Abba Father."

The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are 
God's children...

Now if we are children, then we are heirs, heirs of God
and coheirs with Christ, if indeed we share in His sufferings
in order that we may also share in His glory...(Ro. 8:14-17) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Paul uses adoption to illustrate the believers 'new' relationship
with God. In the Roman culture, the adopted person lost all
rights to his old family and gained all the rights of a legitimate
child in his new family...

He became a full heir to his new father's estate...

It is the same for a new believer, he or she gains all the
privileges and responsibilities of a child in God's family...

One of these outstanding privileges is being led by the 
Spirit (see Gal. 4:5, 6).

We may not always feel like we belong to God, but the Holy Spirit
is our witness. His inward presence reminds us of who we are and
encourages us with God's love (Ro. 5:5)...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for what is mine through
my personal relationship with You. Guide and direct my life
today so that I will be a better witness for You...Amen.

Keep looking up, He wants to lead you through your difficulties...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
