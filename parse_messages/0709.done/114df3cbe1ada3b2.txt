GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~God wants to give you the power to obey...

Our Meditation for Today:

I put this in human terms because you are weak in your natural
selves. Just as you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery 
to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer them 
in slavery to righteousness leading to holiness...

When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of
righteousness.

What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are 
now ashamed of? Those things result in death!

But now that you have been set free from sin and have become 
slaves to God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the
result is eternal life...(Ro. 6:19-22) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

It is impossible to be neutral. Every person has a master, either
God or sin.

A Christian is not someone who can not sin but someone who is 
no longer a slave to sin. He or she belongs to God...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, each and every day I need to 
look to You for the strength and power to turn from
those old sinful ways and to be more faithful to You.
Give me the power again today...Amen.

Keep looking up, God does not ignore those who depend on Him...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
