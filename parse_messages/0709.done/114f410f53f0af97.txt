Subject: Get your flag ready for 09/11/2007




Fly your flag!!!!


Please join us in this FLY THE FLAG campaign and PLEASE forward this Email 
immediately to everyone in your address book asking them to also
forward it. 

We have a little less than one week and counting to get the word
out all across this great land and into every community in the United
States of America.

If you forward this email to least 11 people and each of those people
do he same ... you get the idea.

THE PROGRAM:

On Monday, September 11th, 2007, an American flag should be displayed
outside every home, apartment, office, and store in the United States. 

Every individual should make it their duty to display an American
flag on this sixth anniversary of our country's worst tragedy. We do this
honor of those who lost their lives on 9/11, their families, friends and loved
ones who continue to endure the pain, and those who today are fighting at
home and abroad to preserve our cherished freedoms.

In the days, weeks and months following 9/11, our country was bathed
in American flags as citizens mourned the incredible losses and stood 
shoulder-to-shoulder against terrorism. 

Sadly, those flags have all but disappeared. Our patriotism pulled us through some 
tough times and it shouldn't take another attack to galvanize us in solidarity. 

Our American flag is the fabric of our country and together we can prevail over 
terrorism of all kinds.

Action Plan:

So, here's what we need you to do.

(1) Forward this email to everyone you know (at least 11 people).
Please don't be the one to break this chain. Take a moment to think back to
how you felt on 9/11 and let those sentiments guide you.

(2) Fly an American flag of any size on 9/11. Honestly, Americans
should fly the flag year-round, but if you don't, then at least make it a
priority on this day.

Thank you for your participation. God Bless You and God Bless
America!
