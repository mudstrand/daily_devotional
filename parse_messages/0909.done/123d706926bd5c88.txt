09/20/09~~~food for thought~~~I AM WEAK BUT HE IS STRONG...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
God is our ~~~ strength...(Psalm 46:1)

Our Lesson for Today:
Sometimes I don't feel weak. I flex my physical and my spiritual 
muscles like some beefed-up weight lifter and think that I can heft
any amount...

That's how the world entices us to feel.
But how soon my muscles turn to flab.

It may be an illness that pushes me on the ropes, and I throw in the towel.
A loved one has a problem my muscles can't lift, and I turn away in frustration.
The years speed by, and my strength degenerates into debilitating weakness.

Worst of all, if I am a thinking person, I worry about sin, that little word with
big consequences. 

Deep down because of it I know that all is not well between God and me.
Deep down I realize when my end comes, I must give an accounting to Him.
Speak about weakness ~ here's an area where I have no strength or muscles 
at all...

"I am weak but He is strong," an old spiritual says...

Yes God is the strength of my life ~ He helps me climb the steepest mountain,
cross the deepest river, cross the widest desert of life. God is the rock of my
salvation...

He has canceled sin's curse, closed hell's door, cracked open forever heaven's 
door through His Son's payment on Calvary's cross. In Him I find the strength I need...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, fill me with Your strength. continually lead
me to trust Your Son for my salvation...Amen.

Ps. Wed. we will be leaving for a week's vacation, 
so there will not be any morning devotions...(sorry)
