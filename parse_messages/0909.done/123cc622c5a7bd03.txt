09/18/09~~~food for thought~~~THE MAGNET OF THE CROSS...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Bit I. when I am lifted up from the earth, 
will draw all men to Myself..." (Jn. 12:32)

Our Lesson for Today:
Just as the Savior said, All people would be affected by His being 
"lifted up from the earth." With this expression Jesus was referring
to His crucifixion when He would hang above Calvary's ground...

His cross would be a magnet having an effect on all people. Either
they will kneel beneath it in faith in the Savior or turn from it in damning
unbelief...

Salvation through Jesus' death and resurrection either attracts or repels
sinners...

The woman at the well in Samaria, the Roman centurion whose servant 
was sick, the Greek who came looking for Jesus, are examples of those 
whom Jesus' love drew to His cross...

With His blood shed on the cross, Jesus has, "purchased men ~ from 
every tribe and language and people and nation" (Rev. 5:9)...

He has also paid for me and wants His cross to draw me to Him as my
only Savior...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, may the gospel message of salvation draw
and keep me always close to the Savior...Amen.
