09/16/09~~~food for thought~~~OUR GO-BETWEEN

Our Bible Verse for Today:
For there is one God and one mediator between God and man,
the man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself a ransom for all men...
(I Tim. 2:5)

Our Lesson for Today:
I think this story is so fitting for this text:

One day a young boy accidentally broke a neighbor's window with
an ice covered snow ball, of course the neighbor went and told 
his mother. When the young lad finally showed his face, his mom 
scolded him and said, "Dad will deal with you when he comes home."

Anxiously, the boy asked his mom, "You have such a caring heart
will you help me deal with dad?"

Not some snowball, but our sins have shattered our relationship with 
God. Even just one sin is enough to put us on the punishment list.

WHY?

Because a holy God has to demand payment for every sin. How can
we stand before Him when it is time to come home???

I don't know about you but I'm not just anxious but terrified. I dread that 
day coming. I need a mediator with a caring heart to speak to the Father
for me...

Jesus is my GO-BETWEEN. He not only speaks for me before the Father
but does so effectively...

The Father listens to Him because Jesus has already paid for the gigantic
snowball of sin I roll in life. When the Redeemer mediates between the 
holy Father and me, the sinner, I'm safe. "Forgiven," 

With Jesus as my go-between, I can approach the holy God confidently
and call Him Father...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Jesus, when I sin, remind me of Your forgiveness
and plead for me before my Father...Amen.
