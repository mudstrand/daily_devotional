09/09/09~~~food for thought~~~True hppiness is being pure in heart...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God." (Mt. 5:8)

Our Lesson for Today:
During Jesus' days on earth, people thought the heart was the seat
of life. And we still talk that way today. So we should understand that 
Jesus is referring to every part of us ~ to our thoughts, words, and deeds...

"Pure" leaves no doubt as to how Jesus wants us to be. He, the holy
Lord, demands holiness from us. as the old saying goes, He wants a
life that has no bugs on the windshield, no dirt on the wheels, just total
sinlessness...

Isn't He asking for the impossible? Yes by ourselves we can't clean 
a single sin from life's windshield or stop even one sin from smearing
it more...

But what we can't do, Jesus came to do. He died on the cross to
cleanse our heart from sin and present it spotless before our Heavenly
Father...

Now He wants our pure heart to show in our life. "Be pure," He says
referring to all our thoughts, words, and deeds. Here on earth we will
never reach that ideal. Our life will still be tainted by daily sin...

Because life is like riding a bicycle up hill if we stop pedaling we will roll 
backward. We need the strength to continue a forward motion which comes 
only from Jesus through His Word...

The more we see His loving face in His Word, the more power we'll have
to keep pumping the bicycle of holiness up the hill of life. And we will even 
find happiness in doing so...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, create a new heart within me that knows 
the Savior and loves to follow His ways...Amen.
