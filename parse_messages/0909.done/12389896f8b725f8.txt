09/05/09~~~food for thought~~~Has Satan laid a guilt trip on you?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Blessed are those who mourn, for they
will be comforted..." (Mt. 5:4)

Our Lesson for Today:
"Blessed are those who mourn," Jesus continues in His Sermon
on the Mount. With 'mourn' He refers to a grief that grips the heart...

What is it that grips my heart the hardest as a believer and makes it
grieve the most? If I am to be truthful at all times, I have to say my sin...

Christians who are truly Christian mourn deeply over their sins. They
do not just go through the motions of confessing them but pour out their 
hearts to God...

When I truly see the nature of my sin, the guilt it lays on me, the damnation
it earns me, I mourn in genuine sorrow...

But the Savior has what it takes to dry our tears ~ He says that I should 
be of good cheer, because my sins are forgiven...

Do I mourn because life is squeezing me with all its problems? He says,
"In all things God works for the good of those who love Him" (Ro. 8:28)...

Does death put its scare into me? He says, "Whoever lives and believes 
in me will never die" (Jn. 11:26)...

From Jesus comes comfort here on earth and perfection in heaven at His side.
That's why I have happiness...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I thank You that Your assurance provides
all I need for body and soul...Amen.
