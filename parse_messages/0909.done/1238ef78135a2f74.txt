09/06/09~~~food for thought~~~Take time today to appreciate what Jesus has given you!

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit
the earth." Mt. 5:5)

Our Lesson for Today:
Jesus says: "Blessed are the meek."

People would rather say, "Blessed are the strong."
"Blessed are those who go after what they want."
"Blessed are the ones who stick up for their rights."

Meek Christians live humbly before their God.
They submit their lives to God's will and humbly follow God's Word.
For them the question "What does God want?" comes before what would I like?"

Toward their neighbors too they exhibit a meek spirit.
When hurt, the meek don't hit back.
When taken advantage of, they don't scheme how to get even.
When disagreements arise, they don't insist on their rights...

They leave such injustices to the hand of a just God.
How can I do otherwise as a believer???

When I truly realize how poor I am in God's eyes and How much I sin
I have to mourn, how can I puff up my chest before God [or] 
lord over my neighbor who's in the same fix as I am???

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, keep my eyes fixed on heaven's riches
so that I live in true meekness...Amen.
