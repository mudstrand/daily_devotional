or rich in spiritual wealth?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven." (Mt. 5:3)

Our Lesson for Today:
Happiness is...How would you finish that sentence?

Happiness is having a million dollars?
being successful?
being able to do what you want?

In His Sermon on the Mount, Jesus gives some unexpected answers.
Reading them, we must remember that He's speaking to believers.
Also He's reminding them not how to be saved but how the saved are to live...

"Blessed are the poor," Jesus says, using a word that describes the
down-and-out, the penniless, helpless, hopeless beggar. No He's not
urging me or you to get rid of all we have if we want His blessing.

He says, "The poor in spirit." He's speaking of people like the tax-collector 
in the temple who had nothing to point to but his sins. Standing as a spiritual
pauper before God, he begged, "God, have mercy on me, a sinner."

Poor-in-spirit, believers confess their utter sinfulness, count all their efforts as 
worthless ashes, and commit themselves completely to the Savior's love...

Jesus reminds us, "Theirs is the kingdom of heaven."

They hold in faith's hand citizenship papers for heaven...

They enjoy all the riches of God's kingdom ~ pardon for sins, 
peace with God, promise of eternal life...

In the world's eyes they are poor, but in God's kingdom they are rich...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, grant me the happiness that only
believers in Jesus can have...Amen.
