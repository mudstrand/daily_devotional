Real cute story.

JESUS & THE MUD PUDDLE
(You gotta believe a 6 year old)

Howard County Sheriff Jerry Marr got a disturbing call
one Saturday afternoon a few months ago.
His 6-year-old grandson, Mikey, had been hit by a car
while fishing in Greentown with his dad.

The father and son were near a bridge
by the Kokomo Reservoir
when a woman lost control of her car,
slid off the bridge and hit Mikey
at a rate of about 50 mph.
Sheriff Marr had seen the results of accidents
like this and feared the worst.
When he got to Saint Joseph Hospital ,
he rushed through the emergency
room to find Mikey conscious and in fairly good spirits.

'Mikey, what happened?' Sheriff Marr asked.
Mikey replied, 'Well, Papaw, I was fishin' with Dad,
and some lady runned me over,
I flew into a mud puddle,
and broke my fishin' pole and I didn't get to catch no fish!'

As it turned out, the impact propelled Mikey about 500 feet,
over a few trees and an embankment and in
to the middle of a mud puddle.

His only injuries were to his right femur bone,
which had broken in two places.
Mikey had surgery to place pins in his leg.
Otherwise the boy is fine.

Since all the boy could talk about was
that his fishing pole was broken,
the Sheriff went out to WalMart
and bought him a new one while he was in surgery
so he could have it when he came out.
The next day the Sheriff sat with Mikey
to keep him company in the hospital.
Mikey was enjoying his new fishing pole
and talked about when he could go fishing again
as he cast into the trash can.
When they were alone Mikey,
just as matter-of-fact, said,
'Papaw, did you know Jesus is real?'

'Well,' the Sheriff replied, a little startled.

'Yes, Jesus is real to all who believe in him
and love him in their hearts.'

'No,' said Mikey. 'I mean Jesus is REALLY real.'

'What do you mean?' asked the Sheriff..

'I know he's real 'cause I saw him,' said Mikey,
still casting into the trash can.

'You did?' said the Sheriff.

'Yep,' said Mikey. 'When that lady runned me over
and broke my fishing pole,
Jesus caught me in his arms
and laid me down in the mud puddle.'

GIVES YOU GLORY BUMPS, DOESN'T IT?!


GOD WILL DO THE REST

I asked the Lord to bless you
As I prayed for you today
To guide you and protect you
As you go along your way.

His love is always with you
His promises are true
And when we give Him all our cares
You know He will see us through.

So when the road you're traveling on
Seems difficult at best
Just remember I'm here praying
And God will do the rest.

Pass this on to people you want God to bless!!


Every Day Is Like Saturday!!
Life is short. Break the rules, Forgive quickly, Kiss slowly, Love 
truly, Laugh uncontrollably, And never - EVER, regret anything that made 
you smile.
