09/22/09~~~food for thought~~~A HIGH PRICE FOR A PRECIOUS GIFT...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
No man can redeem the life of another or give to God
a ransom for him ~ the ransom for a life is costly...(Ps. 49:7, 8)

Our Lesson for Today:
What's a life worth? "Nothing," some say as they snuff it out inside the womb
or outside in the world...

"About ten dollars," the scientist calculates as he analyzes the chemicals in the
human body...

"Precious," God answers as He looks at what He has given ~ 
And His answer is the one that counts...

Life is a gift that only God can give ~ Every moment of our life is His gift to us.
Just as with other gifts from God, life has a purpose, In fact, it purpose makes
life a most precious gift...

It's the time a loving God grants each individual to learn of the Savior Jesus and 
be readied for heaven through Him. Because of this purpose, God carefully 
protects life, commanding others to keep their sinful hands off the time of grace 
He gives each person...

Only the blood of God's own Son could pay the ransom required to restore sinful
man to his Creator...

That God should send His Son to pay the ultimate price of His atoning death plainly 
indicates what value God has attached to people...

What are we worth? ~ Nothing as a sinner, but we are precious in God's sight because
of His love and Jesus blood...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, thank You for life. Even more
thank You for Jesus through whom I have eternal life...Amen.

Ps. Remember we are leaving on vacation Tue.
