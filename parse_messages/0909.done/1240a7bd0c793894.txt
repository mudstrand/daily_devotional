I'm sure many of you know about this already.This is true. I went to the web site. It's hard to believe the day of prayer is cancelled for Christians but they can have this at the White House.

Islamic Day of Prayer 
at the White House
Dear Friends, 
We received this email today and feel that it is important enough to pass along to you. 
We need to continue to pray for our nation like never before! 

In June 2007, Presidential candidate Barack Obama declares the USA no longer a Christian nation.

In 1952 President Truman established one day a year as a National Day of Prayer.

In 1988, President Reagan designated the first Thursday in May of each year as the National Day of Prayer. 

This year however, President Obama, decided to cancel the ceremony at the White House not wanting to offend anyone.

On September 25, 2009 from 4am until 7pm, a National Day of Prayer for the Muslim religion will be held on Capitol Hill, beside the White House. As a Christian, it makes me really wonder where the REAL direction of this country is headed. 

Whether you didn't vote for the man or you did, as Christians I would surely hope that this would stir your spirit. They are expecting over 50,000 muslims that day in DC. 

The website is:
www.islamoncapitolhill.com <http://www.islamoncapitolhill.com/> 

Pay particular attention on the website to the bottom of the page where it states, "OUR TIME HAS COME."

2 Chronicles 7:14 says "if my people, who are called by my name,will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land." becomes more important each day. 

Perhaps all the things going on now in this country and around the world could be solved if we would heed this scripture. 
If you feel that this is an important issue, please feel free to make your friends and family aware. If not, delete it. 

Just a few thoughts to ponder on.

God Bless, 
~If this upsets you, we have no one to blame except the Christians who haven't prayed.
~I've heard many complaints about the direction that our country is taking, many people are upset with President Obama and our government officials, but the truth is the only people to blame are we Christians who haven't chased hard after our God. This is a spiritual battle that will become a natural battle if we don't pray.
