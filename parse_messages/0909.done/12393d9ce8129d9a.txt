09/07/09~~~food for thought~~~No one can truly measure the width and depth of God's grace...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
for they will be filled...(Mt. 5:6)

Our Lesson for Today:
When was the last time any of us felt true hunger pangs or
thirst's burning sensation???

Patients fresh from surgery or people who have been marooned
for days in a snow storm can describe real hunger and thirst...

But so can the believer ~ Jesus says "Blessed are those who
hunger and thirst for righteousness."

If we are truly God's child, we should be constantly hungry and
thirsting for the holiness God has prepared for sinners in the Savior...

Our eyes of faith can never look enough on the Lamb of God who
takes away the sins of the world ~ Our ears can never hear too
often of how in Jesus, though our sins be as scarlet, they shall be
as white as snow ~ Our lips can never sing too frequently " Plenteous
grace with You is found, grace to cover all my sins."

As God's child, filled with His forgiveness, I hunger also for a life
of righteousness ~ God has made me His child ~ Now He asks me 
to live as His child...

With Christ's strength, I'm to walk in the newness of life reflecting
a Christ-likeness. When the world views me they should see one
who has true happiness because of God's grace...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, make me always hungry and thirsty for Your
Word with its message of salvation...Amen.

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
