Fri. 13/09~~~food for thought~~~I suppose you noticed that I had the wrong date on 
yesterdays Devo. and are wondering if I have lost it.
Don't feel bad I am wondering too!!!

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, which cannot
be shaken but endures forever...(Ps. 125:1)

The Lord's unfailing love surrounds the man who trusts in Him.
(Ps. 32:10)

Our Lesson for Today:

Have you ever played a game where you are blindfolded and then have to 
run through the woods with someone giving you directions???

It is funny to watch how some will just shuffle their feet and others will wave
their arms feeling for trees, some will just stop and continue to listen, not
quiet trusting the one giving directions...

As Christians, we sometimes feel like blindfolded children. But we are not 
alone in the woods, God will direct us. O yes quite often His leading sounds 
illogical and irrational...

Sometimes He is so challenging that I say, "No I think I'll just crawl back
into my shell and play it safe." BUT then a voice inside me says, "Where's
your courage Sather? Get up and walk, You can trust God."

It takes enormous courage to follow God's leading in the Christian life.
Some of His callings demand just a bit more trust than we can muster.

I believe that is because, spiritual courage or trust is on the endangered
character-quality list...

Prayer Suggestion:
Let us remember to pray for a greater trust in the
One who wants to give us instructions for a safe
walk through life...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
