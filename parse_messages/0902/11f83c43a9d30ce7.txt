Tue. 17/09~~~food for thought~~~Taking the initiative against depression

Our Bible Verses for Today:

(Elijah was afraid and depressed so) He said, "Take my life, for I
am no better than my ancestors."

Then he laid down under a single broom tree. But as he was
sleeping an angel touched him and told him, "Get up and eat!"
(I Kgs. 19:4b, 5)

Our Lesson for Today:

The angel in this passage did not give Elijiah a vision, or explain the
Scriptures to him, or do anything remarkable. He simply told Elijiah
to do a very simple thing, which was, to get up and eat...

If we were never depressed, we would not be alive, only material 
things don't ever suffer depression. If human beings were not capable
of depression, we would have no capacity for happiness...

There are things in life that are designed to depress us; for example,
things that are associated with death. Whenever you examine yourself,
always take into account your capacity for depression...

When the Spirit of God comes to us, He does not give us glorious visions,
but He tells us to do the most ordinary things imaginable. Depression tends
to turn us away from the everyday things of God's creation...

BUT when ever God steps in, His inspiration is to do the most natural, simple
things, things we would never have imagined God was in, but as we do them
we find an initiative against depression...

BUT we must take the first step and do it in the inspiration of God. If however,
we do something simply to overcome our depression, we will only deepen it. 
BUT when the Spirit of God leads us instinctively to do something, the moment
we do it depression is gone. As soon as we arise and obey, we enter into a
higher plain of life...

A Prayer Suggestion:
Pray that you would be sensitive and obedient to
God's inspiration...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
