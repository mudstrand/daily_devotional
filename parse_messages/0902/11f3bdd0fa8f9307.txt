Tue. 3?09~~~food for thought~~~Pride only breeds quarrels, but wisdom is found
in those who take advice...(Pro. 13:10)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

The fear of the Lord is to hate evil; I (the Lord) hate pride and arrogance,
evil behavior and perverse speech...(Pro. 8:13)

When pride comes, then come disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom.
(Pro. 11:2)

Our Lesson for Today:

Very often when some people begin to experience a bit of success,
they become overly confident of their own abilities.They began to behave 
as if no one else in the world can do what they do...

That is to say, they get an exaggerated sense of their own importance
and are puffed up with pride, making it difficult for most people to work
with them...

It becomes difficult for these swollen-head types to continue learning.
Why should they? Don't they already know everything in their field (or
so they assume)?

Despite their talent, they lose their usefulness. They tend to do little 
but think about themselves...

Instead of singing the hymn "How Great Thou Art," their words sound
like "How Great I Am." Just below I think you will find a simple formula
for humility.

IF WE RECOGNIZE THAT:

* God created the universe, including us, and
* God shows that He is much more powerful than we are by what He does
and has done in our world, and
* God give each of us abilities that we cannot supply to ourselves or explain
our worthiness of,
THEN WE ARE HUMBLED...

Prayer Suggestion:
Help me not to think more highly of myself than I should.
Help me to remember that everything I have is a gift from God...
