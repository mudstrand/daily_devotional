Here's your chance to let the media know where the people stand on our faith in God, as a nation. NBC is taking a poll on "In God We Trust" to stay on our American currency. Please send this to every Christian you know so they can vote on this important subject. Please do it right away, before NBC takes this off the web page. Poll is still open so you can vote. http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10103521/

This is not sent for discussion, if you agree forward it, if you don't, delete it. By me forwarding it, you know how I feel.
