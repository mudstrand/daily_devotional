Mon. 23/09~~~food for thought~~~How determined are you to serve...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

"The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve."
(Mt. 20:28)

Jesus also said, "Yet I am among you as the One who serves."
(Lk. 22:27) 

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul's idea of service was the same as our Lord's,
"...ourselves your bondservants for Jesus sake" (2 Cor. 4:5)...

Somehow we have the idea that a person called to the ministry
is called to be different and above other people. BUT according
to Jesus Christ, he is called to be a doormat" for other, called to 
be their spiritual leader, but never their superior...

Paul said, "I know how to be abased..." (Phil. 4:12). Paul's idea 
of service was to pour his life out to the last drop for others. AND
whether he received praise or blame made no difference...

Once we realize that Jesus has served us even to the depths of
our meagerness, our selfishness, and our sin, nothing we encounter
from others will be able to exhaust our determination to serve others
for Christ's sake...

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray that you would be determined to stand fast 
in your service to Christ...
