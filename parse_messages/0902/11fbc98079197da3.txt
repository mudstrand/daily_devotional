Our Bible Verse for Today: (Jesus' disciples)

"Now we see that You know all things and that You don't 
even need to have anyone ask you questions. This makes
us believe that You came from God."

"You believe as last!!!" Jesus answered...(Jn. 16:30, 31)

Our Lesson for Today:

The Disciples say, "Now we Believe..." But Jesus asks, "Do you...?"
Indeed an hour is coming...that you...will leave Me alone." (Jn. 16:31, 32)

Many Christians have left Jesus Christ alone but have still tried to serve
Him out of a sense of duty, OR because they sense a need as a result
of their own discernment...

The reason for this is actually the absence of the resurrection life of Jesus.

This is what happens when our soul has gotten out of intimate contact with 
God by leaning on our own religious understanding. (check out Pro. 3:5, 6).

This is not necessarily a deliberate sin and once a person realizes how
he has hindered his understanding of Jesus Christ, and caused uncertainties, 
sorrows, and difficulties for himself, it is with same and remorse that he has 
to return...

We need to rely on the resurrection life of Jesus on a much deeper level than
we do now. We should get in the habit of continually seeking His counsel
on everything, instead of making our own commonsense decisions and
then asking Him to bless them...

Remember we are not told to "walk in the light" of our conscience or in the
light of a sense of duty, but to "walk in the light as He is in the light." (I Jn. 1:7)

Prayer Suggestion:
Help me to continually walk in Your Light, 
in obedience to You...
