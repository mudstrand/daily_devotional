Thur. 19/09~~~food for thought~~~Taking the initiative against drudgery

Our Bible Verses for Today:

"Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord arises
upon you...

See darkness covers the earth and thick darkness is over the peoples,
but the Lord rises upon you and His glory appears over you...(Isa. 60:1, 2)

Our Lesson for Today:

When it comes to taking the initiative against drudgery, we have to take
the first step as though there were no God. There is no point in waiting 
for God to help us, He will not...

BUT once we arise, immediately we will find He is there. Whenever God 
gives us His inspiration, suddenly taking the initiative becomes a moral issue,
a matter of obedience...

Then we must act to be obedient and not lie down and do nothing. If we
arise and shine, drudgery will be divinely transformed...

When the Lord does something through us, He always transforms it. Our
Lord takes our human flesh and transforms it, and now every believer's body
has become "the temple of the Holy Spirit."

A Prayer Suggestion.
Our prayer should be, "Take my life and let it be consecrated
Lord to Thee...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
