Sat. 21/09~~~food for thought~~~Do you really love Him?

Our Bible Verses for Today:

While Jesus was in Bethany reclining at the table in the home of a 
man known as Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster 
jar of very expensive perfume made of pure nard. She broke the jar
and poured the perfume on His head...

Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another,
"Why this waste of perfume?

"Leave her alone," Jesus said, "Why are you bothering her?
She has done a beautiful thing to Me." (Mk. 14:2, 4, 6)

Our Lesson for Today:

If what we call love doesn't take us beyond ourselves, it is not really
love. If we have the idea that love is characterized as cautious, wise,
sensible, shrewd, and never taken to extremes, we have missed the
true meaning...

Have you ever been driven to do something for God not because you 
felt that it was useful or your duty to do so, or that there was anything in
it for you, but simply because you love Him?

Have you ever realized you can give things to God that are of value to
Him? Or are you just sitting around day-dreaming about the greatness
of His redemption, while neglecting all the things you could be doing for
Him?

There are times when it seems as if God watches to see if we will give 
Him even small gifts of surrender, just to show how genuine our love is
for Him...

To be surrendered to God is of more value than our personal holiness.
Concern over our personal holiness causes us to focus our eyes on 
ourselves, and we become overly concerned about the way we walk, talk,
and look, out of fear of offending God. "...but perfect love casts out fear..."
once we surrender to God (I Jn. 4:18)...

Once we are totally surrendered to God, He will work through us all the
time...

Prayer Suggestion:
Let us pray that our love for the Lord is always genuine...
