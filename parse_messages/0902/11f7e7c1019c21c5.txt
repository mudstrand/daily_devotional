Mon. 16/09~~~food for thought~~~Today lets examine "The inspiration of spiritual initiative...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness,
but rather expose them.
For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient 
do in secret.
But everything exposed by the light becomes visible,
for it is light that makes everything visible. this is why it is said:
"Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine
on you." (Eph. 5:11-14)

Our Lesson for Today:

Not all initiative, (in other words) the willingness to take the first
step, is inspired by God. Someone may say to you, "Get up and
get going! Just do what needs to be done!"

This is just plain or ordinary human initiative... But when the Spirit
of God comes to us and says, in effect, "Get up and get going,"
suddenly we find that the initiative is inspired...

We all have many dreams and inspirations when we are young,
but sooner or latter we realize we have no power to accomplish them.
We cannot do the things we long to do, so our tendency is to think
that our dreams and aspirations are dead...

But God comes and says to us, "Arise from the dead...." When God 
sends His inspiration, it comes to us with such miraculous power 
that we are able to "arise from the dead" and do the impossible...

The remarkable thing about spiritual initiative is that the life and power 
comes after we "get up and get going." God does not give us over 
coming life...He gives us life as we over come...

Remember what our Lord said to the man with the withered hand,
"stretch out your hand" (Mt 12:13). As soon as the man did his hand
was healed, not before. The man took the initiative by stretching out
his hand...

If we will take the initiative to overcome we will find that we have the
inspiration of God, because He immediately gives us the power of life...

Prayer Suggestion:
When we begin to feel useless, dead as it were, say, "Lord
here is my hand, use me as You will."
