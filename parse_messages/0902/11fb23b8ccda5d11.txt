Thur. 26/09~~~food for thought~~~Have you ever questioned the power of God?

Our Bible Verse for Today:

The woman said to Him, "Sir, you have nothing to 
draw [water] with, and the well is deep." (Jn. 4:11)

Our Lesson for Today:

Have you ever said to yourself, "I am impressed with the wonderful truths
of God's word, but He can't really expect me to live up to that and work
all those details into my life!"

When it comes to confronting Jesus Christ on the basis of His qualities
and abilities, our attitudes reflect religious superiority. We are thinking
His ideals are lofty and they impress us, but we think He is not in touch 
with reality, and that what He says cannot actually be done...

If we are honest with ourselves I believe, each of us has thought this
about Jesus in one area of our life or another. These doubts or misgivings
about Jesus begin as we consider questions that divert our focus away 
from God...

Our misgivings arise from the fact that we search within and find how He 
will do what He says. Our doubts actually spring from the depths of our
own inferiority. Now if we detect these misgivings in ourselves, we should
bring them into the light and confess them openly...

Prayer Suggestion: 
"Lord, I have had misgivings about You. 
I have not trusted in Your abilities, but only in mine.
And I have not believed in Your almighty power apart 
from my finite understanding of it...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
