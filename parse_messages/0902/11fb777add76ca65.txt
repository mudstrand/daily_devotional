Fri. 27/09~~~food for thought~~~The well of our incompleteness is deep...

Our Bible Verse for Today: 
(I know this is the same vs. as yesterday but there is more I want to say)

"Where then do you get that living water?" (Jn. 4:11)

Our lesson for Today:

"The well is deep" Yes even deeper than the Samaritan woman realized!

Just think about the depths of human nature and human life; 'think' of the depth
of the "wells" in you...

Have you been limiting, the ministry of Jesus to the point that He is unable to 
work in your life? Suppose that you have a deep "well" of hurt and trouble inside
your heart, and Jesus comes and says to you, "Let not your heart be troubled..."
(Jn. 14:1)

Would your response be to shrug your shoulders and say, "But, Lord, the well is
to deep, and even You can not draw up quietness and comfort out of it."

Actually, that is correct. Jesus does not bring anything up from the wells of human 
nature, He brings them down from above...

The thing that approaches the very limits of His power is the very thing we as His 
followers ought to believe He will do. We impoverish and weaken His ministry in
us the moment we forget He is the Almighty...

The reason some of us are such poor examples of Christianity is that we have
failed to recognize that Christ is the Almighty. Oh yes we have so many Christian
attributes and experiences, BUT we cling too much to our earthly cares and do not
surrender to Jesus Christ as we should...

Yes our 'well' of incompleteness runs deep, but we need to make every effort
to look away from ourselves and look toward the Almighty...

Prayer Suggestion:
Admit that you can't do it, but all things are possible with
Christ, 'The Almighty'...
