Wed. 18/09~~~food for thought~~~Take the Initiative against despair

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Then He came to His disciples and said, "Still sleeping? Still resting?
Look, the time has come. I the Son of Man, am betrayed into the
hands of sinners...

Up, lets be going. See My betrayer is here!"

Our Lesson for Today:

In the Garden of Gethsemane, the disciples went to sleep when they
should have stayed awake, and once they realized what they had done
it produced despair...

The sense of having done something irreversible tends to make us despair.
We say, "Well, it's all over and ruined now; what's the point in trying anymore?"

If we think this kind of despair is an exception we are mistaken. Its a very 
ordinary human experience...

But Jesus comes and lovingly says to us, in essence, "Sleep on now. That
opportunity is lost forever and you can't change that. But get up, and lets go
on to the next thing."

In other words, let the past sleep, BUT let it sleep in the sweet embrace of
Christ, and let us go on into the invincible future with Him...

Never let the sense of past failure defeat your next step...

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray that you can dismiss past failures but be able to learn from them...
