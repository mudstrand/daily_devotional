HAVE A BLESSED DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~You are only part of God's Kingdom by faith...

Our Bible Verses For Today:

(you will probably need to go to your bible and read 
the preceding verses to understand this portion)

Paul says, If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits 
is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, 
so are the branches...

If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, 
though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among
the others and now share the same nourishing sap from
the olive root,

do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this:
You do not support the root, by the root supports you.

You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I could 
be grafted in."

Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and 
you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid...

For if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare 
you either... (Ro. 11:16-21) NIV

Here Is What We Should Glean From This:

Speaking to Gentile Christians of his day, as well as us, Paul warns 
not to feel superior because some Jews were rejected...

Abraham's faith is like the root of a productive tree, and the
Jewish people are the tree's natural branches. BUT because 
of faithlessness, some of the Jews have been broken off and
the Gentile believers, who were branch from a wild olive tree,
have been grated in...

Both Jew and Gentiles share the tree's nourishment based on
faith in God; neither can rest on heritage or culture for salvation.

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father help me to remain humble in the fact
that I have a place in Your Kingdom, not because of any
merit of my own, but strictly because of faith in Jesus Christ...Amen.

Keep looking up, Jesus saves...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
