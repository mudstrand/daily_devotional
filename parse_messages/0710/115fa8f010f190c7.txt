Our Bible Verses for Today:

I don't want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you 
may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part
until the full number of Gentiles has come in...

And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: "The deliver will
come from Zion; He will turn godlessness away from Jacob...

Here Is What We Should Glean From This:

Some say the phrase "and so all Israel will be saved" means that
the majority of the Jew in the final generation before Christ's return 
will turn to Christ for salvation...

Others say that Paul is using the term Israel to refer to the "Spiritual"
nation of Israel, which is comprised of Jews and Gentiles who have
received salvation through faith in Christ...

AND so, "all Israel" (or all believers) will receive God's promised gift 
of salvation...

Still others say that "all Israel" means Israel as a whole will have a role
in Christ's Kingdom. The Jews' identity as a people won't be discarded.
God chose the nation of Israel, and He has never rejected it...

He also chose the church, through Jesus Christ and He will never reject 
it either...

This does not mean, of course, that all Jews or all church members will
be saved. It is possible to be Jewish or to belong to a church without 
ever responding in faith. But just because some people have rejected 
Christ does not mean that God stops working with either Israel or the 
church...

He continues to offer salvation freely to all.

Still others say that the phrase "and so" means "in this way" or
"this is how," referring to the necessity of faith in Christ...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Give me wisdom to sort out the truth
about salvation, that I would glean from Your Word Your will.
Open my heart that I may see glimpses of truth You have for me...Amen

Keep looking up, He is the truth, the light, and the way...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
