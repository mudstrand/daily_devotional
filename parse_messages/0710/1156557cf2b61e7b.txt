THIS IS THE DAY THE LORD HAS MADE~~~LET US REJOICE AND BE GLAD IN IT...

Our Meditation for Today:

For those God foreknew He also predestined to be conformed
to the likeness of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among
many brothers...

And those He predestined, He also called; those He called he
also justified; Those He justified, He also glorified...(Ro. 8:29, 30) NIV

What Is The Meaning of This:

God's ultimate goal for us is to make us like Christ (I Jn.3:2).

As we become more and more like Him, we will discover our true
selves, the person we were created to be...

How can we become like Christ? By reading and heeding the Word, 
by studding His life on earth through the Gospels, by spending time in
prayer, by being filled with His Spirit, and by doing His work in the world.


Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your Word,
I thank You for Your Son's coming to earth, and
living a life we can attempt to copy. I thank You for
the avenue of prayer in which we can come to You
day or night. Help me to be sensitive to what it is You 
want me to do for You today...Amen.

Keep looking up, He possibly has a special job for you today...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
