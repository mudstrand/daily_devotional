GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Above all things, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life. 

Our Meditation for Today:

What then shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, 
who can be against us?

He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us,
how will He not also along with Him, graciously give us all
things...

Who will bring a charge against those whom God has chosen?
It is God who justifies...

Who is He that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died, more than 
that, who was raised to life, is at the right hand of God and is also 
interceding for us...(Ro. 8:31-34) NIV

What Can Be Learned From This? 

Do you ever think that because you aren't good enough for God,
He will not save you?

Do you ever feel as if salvation is for everyone else but you?

Then these verses are especially for you...

If God gave His Son for you, He isn't going to hold back the gift
of salvation! If Christ gave His life for you, He isn't going to turn 
around and condemn you!

He will not withhold anything you need to live for Him...

The book of Romans is more than a theological explanation of
God's redeeming grace~~it is a letter of comfort and confidence 
addressed to you...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for (Jn. 3:16) and the assurance
it give me of my salvation. I thank You for the confidence I receive 
of Your redeeming love. I pray today for the safety of our nation, its
citizens and our troops. Bless and keep my e-mail friend safe and
secure...Amen.

Keep looking up, fix your gaze on Him...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
