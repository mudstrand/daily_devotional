GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Always honor God...

Our Meditation for Today:

Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites
is that they may be saved...

For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but
their zeal is not based on knowledge...(Ro. 10:1, 2) NIV

Here Is What We should Learn From This:

A question which may come to mind is, what will happen to the
Jewish people who believed in God but not Christ?

Since they believe in the same God, won't they be saved?

If that were true, Paul would not have had to work so hard and
sacrificed so much to teach them about Christ...

Because Christ is the most complete revelation of God, we
cannot fully know God apart from Christ; and because God
appointed Jesus to bring God and people together, we cannot
come to God by another way...

The Jews, like everyone else, must find salvation through Jesus
Christ (Jn. 14:6; Acts 4:12)...

Like Paul, we should pray that all Jews might be saved and lovingly
share the Good News with them...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for not praying as I should for
the Jews, I know they are Your chosen people, so it goes without 
saying that You would wish for them all to be saved...Instill in me
a heart for the lost...Amen.

Keep looking up, for your guidance...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
