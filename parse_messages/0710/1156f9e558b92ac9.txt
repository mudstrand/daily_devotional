GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Remember the Lord sees and hears us 24/7...

Our Meditation for Today:

Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble
or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger
or sword?

As it is written: "For Your sake we face death all day long; 
we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered." (Ro. 8:35, 36) NIV

What We Should Learn From This:

These words were written to a church which would soon undergo 
terrible persecution...

In just a few years, Paul's hypothetical situations would turn into 
painful realities...

But this passage also reaffirms God's profound love for His people...

No matter what happens to us, no matter where we are, we can never 
be separated from His love...

Suffering should not drive us away from God but help us to identify with 
Him and allow His love to heal us...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, our Protector, Provider, and Redeemer,
I thank You, that You are always near to protect, provide and
save me from the wiles of Satan. Instill in me a sensitivity to the
dangers of temptation...Help me to have a closer walk with Thee...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will sustain you in your troubles...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
