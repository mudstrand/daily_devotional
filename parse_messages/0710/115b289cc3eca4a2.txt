God's Blessing to You!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~The will of God will never take you, where 
the grace of God will not protect you...

Our Meditation for Today:

The Jews did not know the righteousness that comes from God
and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God's
righteousness...

Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness 
for everyone who believes...

Moses describes in this way the righteousness that is by the law:
"The man who does these things will live by them." (Ro 10:3-5) NIV

The Lesson To Be Learned:

Rather than living by faith in God, the Jews established customs
and traditions (in addition to God's law) to try to make themselves
acceptable in God's sight...

But human effort, no matter how sincere, can never substitute
for the righteousness God offers us by faith. The only way to 
earn salvation is to be perfect ~~ and that is impossible. We
can only hold out our empty hands and receive salvation as a 
gift...

Our Prayer for Today
Dear Heavenly Father, I know that the cost that was paid for 
the gift of eternal life is beyond anything I could ever be 
capable of repaying. So I give thanks for that gift with a humble 
heart, accepting Your love and mercy...Amen

Keep looking up, He wants to shower you with His love...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
