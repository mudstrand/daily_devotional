Have a Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Be an encourager...

Our Meditation for Today:

Paul's sermon-net was, "Everyone who calls on the name of
the Lord will be saved." Now we have these question...

How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed 
in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have 
not heard? And how can they hear without someone
preaching to them?

And how can they preach unless they are sent? as it is written,
"How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!"
(Ro. 10:14, 15) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

We who do believe are to take God's great message of
salvation to others so they can respond to the Good News.

How will your loved ones and neighbors hear unless someone 
tells them?

Is God calling you to take a part in making His message known 
to your community...

Do you know someone who needs to hear the Good News?

Now ask God for a way that you can share so that they can
hear it...then do it as soon as possible...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I have this friend who is seeking
a new way of life, help me to share with him the message
you want him to hear. Guide me so that I do not scare him
off or confuse him...Amen.

Keep looking up, for your guidance...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
