GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~The Lord says, "I hate pride and arrogance 
evil behavior and perverse speech...

Our Meditation for Today:

Paul writes: Not by works but by Him who calls ~ Rebekah was told,
"The older will serve the younger.

Just as it is written: "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."

What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all!

For He says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,
and will have compassion on whom I have compassion...
(Ro. 9:12-15) NIV

The Lesson to be Learned:

Was it right for God to choose Jacob, the younger, to be over Esau?

In Malachi 1:2, 3, the statement "I showed my love for you by loving
your ancestor Jacob. Yet Esau was Jacob's brother, and I rejected Esau"
this refers to the nation of Israel and Edom rather than the individual brothers.

God chose Jacob to continue the family line of the faithful because He
knew his heart was for God...

BUT He did not exclude Esau from knowing and loving Him.

We need to keep in mind the kind of God we worship: He is sovereign; 
He is not arbitary; in all things He works for our good; He is trustworthy;
He will save all who believe in Him...

When we understand these qualities of God, we know that His choices
are good even if we do not understand all His reasons...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I surely don't understand all that You
do, for if I did You would not be God. But I do accept Your
reasoning by faith seeking to follow You daily. Forgive me
when I stumble...Amen.

Keep looking up in faith, He knows what is best...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
