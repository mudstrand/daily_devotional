THIS IS THE DAY THAT THE LORD HAS MADE~~LET US REJOICE AND BE GLAD IN IT...

Our Meditation for Today:

No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him
who loved us.

For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels, nor
demons, neither the present nor the future , nor any powers,

neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be
able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus
our Lord...(Ro. 8:37-39) NIV

Here is What We Can Learn From This:

These verse contain one of the most comforting promises in all
the Scriptures...

Believers have always needed to face hardships in many forms:
Persecution, illness, imprisonment, and yes even death...

But of course this sometimes cause believers to think they have been 
abandoned by Christ...

But Paul says: "This is impossible." He says it is impossible to
be separated from Christ...

How can we be sure of this? ~~ Christ's death for us is proof of His
unconquerable love. Nothing, can separate us from Christ's presence.

God tells us how great His love is so that we will feel totally secure in Him.
If we believe these overwhelming assurances, we will not be afraid...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear heavenly Father, I thank You for this wonderful promise.
I thank You for the assurance that nothing can separate me
from the presence of Jesus Christ. I thank You for Your love...Amen.

Keep looking up ~~ He has a blessing for you...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
