Have A Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~There is no shame in trusting in Him

Our Meditation for Today:

But what does it say? "The word is near you; it is in your mouth
and in your heart," that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming:

That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe 
in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.

For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is
with your mouth that you confess and are saved...

As the Scripture says, "Anyone who trusts in Him will never be put 
to shame...

For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile ~~ The same 
Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on Him...(Ro. 10:8-12) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Have you ever been asked. "How do I become a Christian?"

Well these verses give you the beautiful answer ~~ Salvation
is as close as your lips and heart...

People often think it must be a complicated process, but
it is not. If we believe in our heart and say with our mouth 
that Christ is the risen Lord, we will be saved...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the simplicity of
receiving eternal life. Lord I pray that more people would
accept this way of Salvation. I ask Your blessing upon all
my e-mail friends this day...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is the Way the Truth and the Life...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
