HAVE A BLESSED DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Salvation can never be earned...


Our Bible Verse for Today:

Paul has just told us in verse 5 that there is a remnant chosen by grace.

Then he says: And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were,
grace would no longer be grace...(Ro 11:6) NIV

What is the Message?

Think about this, do you think it's easier for God to love you when you're good?

Do you secretly suspect that God chose you because you deserved it?

Do you think that some people's behavior is so bad that God couldn't possibly
save them?

If you ever think this way, you don't entirely understand that salvation is by grace,
a free gift. It can not be earned, in whole or in part; it can only be accepted with
thankfulness and praise...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I do thank you for the free gift
that You have provide in Christ Jesus Your Son. Guide 
us by Your grace I pray in Jesus Name...Amen.

Keep looking up, God loves you...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
