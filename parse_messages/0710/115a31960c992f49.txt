GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Serve the purpose for which 
you were created...

Our Meditation for Today:

One of you will say to me, "Then why does God still blame? For who
resists His will?"

But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? "Shall what is formed 
say to Him who formed it, 'Why did You make me like this?

Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of
clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use?

Here Is What We Should Learn From These Verses:

With this illustration, Paul is not saying that some of us are worth more 
than others, but that the Creator has control over the created object...

The created object, therefore, has no right to demand anything from its
Creator~~its very existence depends on Him...

Keeping this perspective removes any temptation to have pride in any
personal achievement...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for complying that others
have far more talent than I. I should be very thankful for the
gifts You have given me. If I were to truly examine my life I
would have to confess that I have so much to be thankful for...
Thank You Lord for those blessings...Amen.

Keep looking up, with thanksgiving...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
