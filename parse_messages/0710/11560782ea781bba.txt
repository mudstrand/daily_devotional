GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Honor the Lord with your first-fruits~~~(your best)...(Pro. 3:9)

Our Meditation for Today:

And we know that in all things God works for the good of those 
who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose.
(Ro. 8:28) NIV

Here Is What We Should Learn From This Verse:

God works in "everything" not just isolated incidents for our good.
This does not mean that all that happens to us is good...

Evil is prevalent in our fallen world, but God is able to turn every 
circumstance around for our long-range good...

We need to note that God is not always working to make us happy
but to fulfill His purpose...

We also should note that this promise is not for everyone. It can 
only be claimed by those who love God, and are called by Him, that
is, those whom the Holy Spirit convinces to receive Christ...

Such people have a new perspective, a new mind-set. They trust
in God, not in worldly treasures; their security is in heaven, not on
earth. Their faith in God does not waver in pain and persecution 
because they know God is with them...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father of all mercy and grace, the creator of all things,
keep our nation, its citizens, and our troops safe from all harm. Bless
my e-mail friends with good health and safety...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will help you with your problems...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
