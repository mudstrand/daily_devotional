HAPPY COLUMBUS DAY~~~(food for thought)~~~Remember our ways are in full view
of the Lord...

Our Meditation for Today:

I Speak the truth in Christ~~~I am not lying, my conscience
confirms it in the Holy Spirit,

I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart...

For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from
Christ for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race...
(Ro. 9:1-3)

Here Is What We Should Learn From These Verses:

We see that Paul expresses concern for his Jewish "brothers
and sisters" by saying that he would willingly take their punishment
if that would save them...

Now we need to remember, Christ is the only one who can save us.

Paul shared a rare depth of love. Like Jesus he was willing to 
sacrifice so others would be saved...

How concerned are you for those who do not know Christ?

Are you willing to sacrifice your time, money, energy, comfort, and 
safety to see them come to faith in Jesus?

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for not showing the 
concern I should for the lost. Instill in me a genuine concern
for all who are walking in darkness...Amen.

Keep looking up, He wants to be your guide...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
