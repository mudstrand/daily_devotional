VERSE FOR TODAY:

Solomon after examining his life says, "_So I turned in despair_

_from hard work , it was not the answer to my search for
satisfaction_

_in this life." _(Ecc. 2:20)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

Solomon's point is that God has a plan for all people. God provides

cycles of life, each with it's work for us to do. Although we may
face

many problems that seem to contradict God's plan, these should not

be barriers to believing in Him but rather opportunities to discover

that without God, life's problems have no lasting solutions.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Heavenly Father, what would we be if You were to forsake us,

if You withdrew Your Word and Your hand? Enlighten us with Your

Word. Let us walk in the light of Your blessed Son, our Lord Jesus

Christ. . . Amen.
