VERSE FOR TODAY:

_Solomon says, "Then I saw that there is more gain in wisdom_

_than in folly, as there is more gain in light then in darkness._

_the wise person has his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in _

_darkness. And yet I perceived the same event happens to them _

_all. _(Ecc. 2:13-14)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

Rich and poor have one similarity; when they die they will

leave all they own behind. At the moment of death (which every

one will face) both rich and poor are naked and empty handed and

will face the Lord.. The only riches have at that time are those we

have already invested in, our eternal heritage.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Heavenly Father, I know that one day I will stand before You

empty handed. I pray that at that time I will have attained eternal

life through faith in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. . . Amen.
