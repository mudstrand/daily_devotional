VERSE FOR TODAY:

_Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline
_

_drives it far from him. _(Pro. 22:15)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

_"Heart of a child" _I think many tend to think of children as
morally

neutral at worst. BUT THE Bible does not; it says we are born with a

sinful nature. Godly education means not merely bringing the child's

good talents to light but also driving out the bad. The Bible does
approve

of corporal punishment. HOWEVER. it does not envision the sort of
abuse

that would maim, or kill a child, BUT rather it promotes discipline
that

instructs.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Heavenly Father, I pray for those poor children who have had to

live in conditions which will only cause to another generation of

abused children. Its only by Your grace that this can be discontinued

Amen.
