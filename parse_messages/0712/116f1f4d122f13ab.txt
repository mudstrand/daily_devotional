Have a Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for Thought) ~~~ We cannot Hide from God...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Paul said, "I planted the seed, and Apollos watered it, 
but God made it grow." (I Cor. 3:6) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul had planted the Good News in the people's hearts.
He was a missionary pioneer; he brought the message of 
salvation...

Apollos watered the seed. He help the believers grow stronger
in the faith. Paul founded the church in Corinth, and Apollos
built on that foundation...

Tragically, the believers in Corinth had split into different factions,
pledging loyalty to different teachers...

After the preacher's work is done, God is the one who makes
Christians grow...

Our leaders should be respected, but we should never place 
them on a pedestal that create barriers between people or set
them up as a substitute for Christ...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, who art the creator and sustainer 
of all that exists, Holy is Your name above all names. Help me 
to become wise unto salvation, I pray for a teachable heart.
Bless all my e-mail friends...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is looking for a closer walk with you...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather.
