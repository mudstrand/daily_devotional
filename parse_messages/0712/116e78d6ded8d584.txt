Good Morning!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~When Christ returns, we will see Him face to face...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized
into the name of Paul?

I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,

so no one can say that you were baptized into my name...(I Cor. 2:13-15) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul's words were authoritative because their source was the Holy Spirit.
Paul was not merely giving his own personal views or his personal
impression of what God had said...

Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, he wrote the very thoughts and
words of God...

People who refuse to believe can not understand spiritual truths, and 
they can not grasp the thought that God's Spirit lives in every believer...

Don't expect most people to approve of or understand you decision
to follow Christ. It seems so silly to them...

The person who rejects Christ cannot understand truths from God's Spirit.
The lines of communication have been broken, and so they will not hear
what God is saying to them...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You that I do believe, but help
me to grow even more in my faith in You. Forgive me for my
sins of thought, word and deed. I pray that Your Spirit will be
able to break into the heart of those who cannot find time for
Your Word...Amen.

Keep looking up, His return is eminent...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
