Hi!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Live truly, and your life will be a great and noble creed...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
(Apostles of Christ)

So then, men ought to regard us as servants of Christ and as 
those entrusted with the secret things of God...

Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must 
prove faithful...(I Cor. 4:1-2) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul urged the Corinthians to think of him, Peter, and Apollis
as mere servants of Christ entrusted with the secret things
of God...

A servant does what his master tells him to do. We too must 
do what God tells us to do in the Bible and through His Holy
Spirit...

Each day God presents us with needs and opportunities that
challenges us to do what we know is right...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to see the opportunities 
that You place before me. Open my eyes that I might see
glimpses of truth You have for Me. Forgive me for my sins
of omission...Amen.

Keep looking up, humbly [correct] those who have gone astray...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
