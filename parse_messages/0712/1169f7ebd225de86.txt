Have a Blessed Day!!!~~(food for thought)~~When believing in Christ you will experience miracles...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul writes: I myself am convinced, my brothers, that you yourselves
are full of goodness, complete in knowledge and competent to instruct
one another...

I have written you quite boldly on some points, as if to remind you of
them again, because of the grace God gave me

to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles with the priestly duty of
proclaiming the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an
offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit...

Therefore I glorify in Christ Jesus in my service to God ...(Ro. 15:14-17) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

We see here that Paul was very enthusiastic about what God had
done through him...

Being proud of God's God work is not a sin ~ it is worship...

If you are not sure whether your pride is selfish or not, ask yourself 
this question: Am I just as proud of what God is doing through other 
people as of what He is doing through me?

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to always remember, that the spread 
of the Gospel is through the power of Your Holy Spirit, not by any power
I may poses. I pray that I may never get in the way of Your Spirit's work.
Bless and keep all my e-mail friends safe and healthy...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is there to lead you...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
