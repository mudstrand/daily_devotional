Have a Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Confession to God always brings His Cleansing...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

God has revealed it (His plan) to us by His Spirit. The Spirit
searches all things, even the deep things of God...(I Cor 2:10)

Our Lesson for Today:

"God's deep secrets" refers to God's unfathomable nature and
His whole wonderful plan ~ Jesus' death and resurrection ~ and 
the promise of salvation, which is revealed only to those who
believe that what God says is true...

Those who believe in Christ's death and resurrection and put 
their faith in Him will know all they need to know to be saved...

This knowledge, however, can't be grasped by even the wisest 
people unless they accept God's message...

All who reject God's message are foolish, no matter how wise
the world thinks they are...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your Message of salvation.
Instill in me a greater sensitivity to Your Spirit's teaching that I might
understand Your deep secret more fully...Amen.

Keep looking up, for a greater understanding...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
