Have a Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~When we worship God, only
our best is good enough...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Grace and peace to you from God our Father and our
Lord Jesus Christ...(I Cor. 1:3)

Our Lesson for Today:

As we think about this letter of Paul's we see a quite different greeting
than what we use in our letters today...But what a wonderful greeting
it would be to be reminded of God's wonderful grace...

Grace is God's free gift of salvation given to us in Christ. Receiving it 
brings us peace (Ro. 5:1)...

In a world of noise, confusion, and continuous pressure, people long
for peace. Many give up the search, thinking it is impossible to find,
but true peace of heart and mind is available to us through faith in
Jesus Christ...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, It is so wonderful to have the peace
that comes from having a personal relationship with Jesus
Christ. I pray that peace would become real to the whole 
world...Bless and keep my e-mail friends safe...Amen.

Keep looking up, in Him there is true peace...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
