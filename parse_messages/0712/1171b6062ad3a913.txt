Have a Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Be doers of the Word, and not hears only...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert
builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should
be careful how he builds...

For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, 
which is Jesus Christ...(I Cor. 3:10, 11) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

The foundation of the church ~ of all believers ~ is Jesus Christ...

Paul laid this foundation by (preaching Christ) when he began the 
church in Corinth...

Who ever builds the church ~ officers, teachers, preachers, parents,
and others ~ must build with high-quality materials (right doctrine and
right living) that meets God's standard...

Paul is challenging future leaders to have sound preaching and teaching...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, help me to always do my part in making
sure that Your Word is always preached properly. 
Help me to make sure that the doctrine that is being
preached is correct...Amen.

Keep looking up, for godly wisdom...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather...
