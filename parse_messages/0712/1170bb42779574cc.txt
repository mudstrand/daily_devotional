Merry Christmas!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Let nothing be done through 
selfish ambition (Phil. 2:3a)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual but as worldly ~ 
mere infants in Christ...

I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it.
Indeed you are still not ready...

You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling 
among you, are you not worldly? are you not acting like mere
men? (I Cor. 3:1-3) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

The reason Paul called the Corinthians infants in the Christian life
is because they were not yet spiritually healthy and mature...

The proof was in their quarreling like children, allowing differences
to distract them...

When we are controlled by our own desires we are acting immaturely.

Mature believers are in tune with God's desires. We need to examine
ourselves and ask, "How much influence do my desires have on my life?

Our desires should be to let God's desires be ours. Being controlled
by our own desires will stunt our spiritual growth...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, instill in me a desire to always
be in your will. Help me to put aside selfish desires.
Help me to put your will first in my life, and then I know
You will fulfil all my needs...Amen.

Keep looking up, and He will let you know His desire for you...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
