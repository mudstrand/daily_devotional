Have a Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~How are you helping the Word to grow?

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Now to him who is able to establish you by my gospel and the 
proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the
mystery hidden for long ages past,

but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings
by the command of the eternal God, so that all nations might believe
in Him,

to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen.
(Ro. 16:25-27) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

As Jerusalem was the center of Jewish life, Rome was the world's
political, religious, social, and economic center...

There the major governmental decisions were made, and from there
the Good News spread to the ends of the earth...

Paul had not yet been to Rome to meet all the Christians there, and,
of course, he has not yet met us. We, too, live in a cosmopolitan setting
with the entire world open to us...

We also have the potential for both widespread influence and wrenching
conflict. We need to listen carefully to Paul's teaching about unity, service,
and love so we may apply them...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that You would help me to grow in faith so
that I would become faithful in the spreading of Your Word as Paul was.
Use me in a great and mighty way, so that I may glorify Your name...Amen.

Keep looking up, be useable in the spreading of the Word...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
