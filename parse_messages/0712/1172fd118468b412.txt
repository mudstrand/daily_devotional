you can't love without giving...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Do not deceive yourselves. If anyone of you thinks he is wise
by the standards of this age, he should become a "fool" so that 
he may become wise...

For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. 
As it is written: "He catches the wise in their craftiness,

and again, "The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise
are futile...

So then, no more boasting about men! All things are yours.
(I Cor. 3:18-21) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul is not telling us to neglect the pursuit of knowledge.
He is warning us not to glory in the wisdom of this age ~
(this life)...

God's way of thinking is far above ours; He knows all the futile
thoughts of the "wise"...

The Corinthians were boasting about the wisdom of their leaders
and teachers. Their pride made them value the messengers 
more that the message...

We are not to put our trust in anyone but God...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to always focus on the message
and not so much on the messenger. Help me to be true to Your 
Word. Bless all my e-mail friends with good health and safety...Amen.

Keep looking up, in loving service to Him...
You are in the Prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
