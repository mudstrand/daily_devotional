than poverty of purse...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
I was undecided as to what book to do for the next devotional 
but I enjoy Paul's letters so I decided to follow with I Corinthians...

Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,
and our brother Sosthenes. (I Cor. 1:1) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

As is very plain here, we see that Paul was give a special calling
from God to preach about Jesus Christ...

The calling of every Christian is not always so obvious ~ But each 
Christian has a job to do ~ A role to take ~ or a contribution to make...

One assignment may seem more spectacular than another ~ but
all are necessary to carry out God's greater plans for His church ~
and for His world see (I Cor. 12:12-27)...

The most important thing is that we remain available to God by
placing our gifts at His service ~ Then as you discover what He 
calls you to do, be ready to do it...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that I will always remain available,
for I know that you will equip me for the task you have for me.
Bless all my e-mail friends today with good health...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will make His will known...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
