Have a Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~God is able to change the vilest heart...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come
from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he 
cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned...

The Spiritual man makes judgments about all things, but he himself 
is not subject to any man's judgment...(I Cor 2:14, 15) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Non-Christians cannot understand spiritual truths, and they cannot
grasp the concept that God's spirit lives in believers...

Don't expect most people to approve or understand your decision to
follow Christ. It seems so silly to them...

Just as a tone-deaf person cannot appreciate fine music, the person
who rejects Christ cannot understand truths from God's Spirit...

With the lines of communication broken, he or she won't be able to
hear what God is saying to him or her...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord I love Your Word but please Lord
give me a deeper understanding of it. Guide 
me in a closer walk with thee...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will give you discernment...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather....
