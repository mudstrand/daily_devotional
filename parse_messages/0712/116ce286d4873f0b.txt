Have a Blessed day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Confession is the key that opens 
the door to forgiveness...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly
wait for the Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed...

He will keep you strong to the end, so that you will be
blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ...

God who has called you into fellowship with His Son Jesus
Christ our Lord, is faithful...(I Cor. 1:7-9) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul guaranteed the Corinthian believers that God would consider 
them "free from blame" when Christ returns...

This guarantee was not because of their great gifts or their shinning 
performance, but because of what Jesus Christ accomplished for 
them through His death and resurrection......

All who have asked Jesus Christ into their heart and have a personal 
relationship with Him, will be considered blameless when He returns.

If you have faith in Christ, even if it is weak, you are and will be saved...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I do believe, but forgive me when
I stumble and fall. Take my hand and lead me in paths of
righteousness. Thank You Lord for the promise of eternal
life. Help me to be a better witness for You...Amen.

Keep looking up ~ He has a place for You...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
