Have a Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~We see in part, God sees the whole...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that all of you agree with one another so that there may be no
division among you and that you may be perfectly united in mind 
and thought...(I Cor. 1:10) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul had founded the church in Corinth but in a year and a half
arguments and divisions arose, and some of the members of 
the church slipped back into an immoral life-style...

Paul wrote this letter to address the problems and to clear up
confusion about right and wrong so that they would remove the
immorality from among them...

The Corinthian people had a reputation for jumping from fad to fad;
Paul want to keep Christianity from degenerating into just another
fad...

We should never, ever, seek for the perfect church, because IF 
we were to ever find it, and join it, it would no longer be perfect...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to see the good in my church
and help me to humbly help correct what is wrong. I pray for
godly-wisdom in my attempt to make my place of worship a
light onto the community...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is the light of the world...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
