Have a Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Be wise onto salvation...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
(Paul's final instruction)

I urge you brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions 
and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching
you have learned. Keep away from them...

For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own
appetites. by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds
of naive people...(Ro. 16:17, 18) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

When we read books or listen to sermons, we should check the 
content of what is written or said so that we won't be fooled by
smooth talk and glowing words...

Christians who study God's Word, asking Him to reveal the truth,
will not be fooled, but nominal Christians may be easily taken in.

In Acts 17:10-12 we have an example of believers who carefully
checked God's Word ~ read it...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to always compare what I
hear with what Your Word says, so that I will not be deceived.
Give me godly-wisdom, that I may always remain faithful to You...Amen.

Keep looking up, and He will make you wise onto salvation...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
