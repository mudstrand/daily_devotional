Have a Nice Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Love as Your Master loves you...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

If any man builds on his foundation using gold, sliver, costly stones,
wood, hay or straw,

his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to
light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of 
each man's work...

if what he has built survives, he will receive his reward...

If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only
as one escaping through the flames...I Cor 3:12-15) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Two sure ways to destroy a building are to tamper with the foundation
and to build with inferior materials...

The church must be built on Christ, not on any other person or principle.
Christ will evaluate each minister's contribution to the life of the church,
and judgment day will reveal the sincerity of each person's work...

God will determine whether or not a person has been faithful to Jesus'
instructions. Good work will be rewarded, unfaithful or inferior work will 
be discounted...

"The builders themselves will be saved, but like one escaping through a 
wall of flames" means that unfaithful workers will be saved but only by the
skin of their teeth...

All their accomplishments will count for nothing...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, help me become more faithful
in my works for You. May I never shirk my duties to You.
Bless all my e-mail friends with good health and safety 
today...Amen.

Keep looking up, for guidance...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
