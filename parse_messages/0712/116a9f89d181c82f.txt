Have a Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~All we have is a gift from God...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of 
the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me...

Pray that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea and
that my service in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints
there,

so that by God's will I may come to you with joy and together with 
you be refreshed ~ The God of peace be with you all. Amen.
(Ro. 15:30-33) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Too often we view prayer as a time of comfort, reflection, or making
our requests known to God. But here Paul urges believers to join in
his struggle by means of prayer...

Prayer is also a weapon in all believers' armor as we intercede for
others who join in the fight against Satan...

Do your prayers reflect that urgency???

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that your hand of protection would
be upon every believer who is struggling under Satan's schemes.
Give us the added strength to stand up against him at all times...Amen.

Keep looking up, for strength to fight the good fight...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
