Our Bible Verses for Today:

So we make it our goal to please Him, whether 
we are at home in the body or away from it...

For we must all appear before the judgement seat
of Christ, that each one may receive what is due
him for the things done while in the body, whether
good or bad...(2 Cor 5:9, 10) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

While eternal live is a gift given on the basis of God's grace 
(Eph. 2:8, 9), each of us will still be judged by Christ. He will 
reward us for how we have lived...

God's gracious gift of salvation does not free us from the 
requirement of faithful obedience. All Christians must give
an account on the day of judgment of how they have lived ~
Mt. 16:27 ~ Ro. 14:10-12 ~ I Cor. 3:10-15...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for another day ~ a day of grace,
but help me to always remember that with Your love, You are also a 
holy and just God. Forgive me Lord for I have sinned against You in 
thought word and deed. I pray for a sensitivity to Your Holy Spirit's 
leading and guiding. I pray these things in Jesus name...Amen.

Keep looking up, allow Him to walk with you today...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
