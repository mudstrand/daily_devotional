Ask what does He want me to do for Him...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Therefore if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation;
the old has gone, the new has come...(2 Cor. 5:17) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

When one accepts Christ as their Savior they become new people on the inside.
The Holy Spirit gives them a new life, and they are not the same anymore...

We are not reformed, rehabilitated, or reeducated ~ we are re-created
(new creations), living in vital union with Christ (Col. 2:6, 7).

At conversion we do not merely turn over a new leaf, we began a new life
under a new Master...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for making it possible for me to 
have a new life ~ a life serving You each day. Help me Lord to
continue in a living relationship with You...Amen.

Keep looking up, let His light shine through you...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
