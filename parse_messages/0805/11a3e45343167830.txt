Our Bible Verse for Today:

See what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what earnestness,
what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm,
what longing, what concern, what readiness to see justice done. 
At every point you have proved yourselves innocent in this matter...
(2 Cor. 7:11) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

It is difficult to be confronted with our sins and even more
difficult to get rid of sin...

Paul praised the Corinthians for clearing up an especially 
troublesome situation (see 2:5-11)...

Do you tend to be defensive when confronted? Don't let
pride keep you from admitting your sin. We need to accept
correction as a tool for our growth, and do all we can to correct
problems that are pointed out to us...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me see the sins in my life that
I covet. Help me to confess them and turn from them, that
I might have a closer walk with you...Amen.

Keep looking up, and He will point out your sins...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
