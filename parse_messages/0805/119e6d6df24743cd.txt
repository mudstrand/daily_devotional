you will escape a hundred days of sorrow.

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul says, "If we are out of our mind, it is for the sake of God;
If we are in our right mind, it is for you...

For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced that
one died for all, and therefore all died...

And He died for all, that those who live should no longer live
for themselves but for Him who died for them and was raised
again...(2 Cor. 5:13-15) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Everything that Paul and his companions did was to honor God.
Christ's love controlled their lives...

Because Christ died for us, we also are dead to our old life.
Like Paul we should no longer live to please ourselves, we
should spend our lives pleasing Christ, who died for us and
rose again from the grave...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that You would forgive me for
I have not honored You as I should have. Help me to live a 
more pleasing life for You...Amen.

Keep looking up, for this is pleasing to Him...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
