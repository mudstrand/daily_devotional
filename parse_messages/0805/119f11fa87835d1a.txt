is with your ears...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

All this is from God who reconciled us to Himself through Christ
and gave us the ministry of reconciliation:

that God was reconciling the world to Himself in Christ, not counting 
men's sins against them. And He has committed to us the message 
of reconciliation...(2 Cor. 5:18, 19) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

God brings us back to Himself (reconcile us) by blotting out our sins.
(see also Eph. 2:13-18) and making us right with Him...

When we trust in Christ, we are no longer God's enemies, or strangers 
or foreigners to Him. Because we have been reconciled to God, we 
have the privilege of encouraging others to do the same...

Yes we too have the task of reconciling people to Him...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for the promise that my sins
are blotted out as soon as I confess them. Help me to grow day 
by day in faith and holiness...Amen.

Keep looking up, trusting in Him for your every need...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
