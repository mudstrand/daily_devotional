Our Bible Verse for Today:
For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us 
an eternal glory the outweighs them all... (2 Cor. 4:17) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Our troubles should not diminish our faith or disillusions us. We should 
realize that there is a purpose for our suffering. Problems and human
limitations have several benefits.
(1) They should remind us of Christ's suffering for us;
(2) They should keep us from pride;
(3) They should cause us to look beyond this brief life;
(4) They should give us opportunities to prove our faith to others; and
(5) They should give God the opportunity to demonstrate His power...

Let us remember to see our troubles as opportunities...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray for added faith and trust in You.
Help me to see what You are trying to teach me in times of
trouble. Forgive me for the lack of faith...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is waiting for your beckon call...
You are in the Prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
