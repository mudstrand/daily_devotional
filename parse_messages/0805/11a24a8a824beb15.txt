Our Bible Verses for Today:

In truthful speech and in the power of God; with weapons of
righteousness in the right hand and in the left;

through glory and dishonor, bad report and good report; genuine,
yet regarded as impostors;

known yet regarded as unknown; dying, and yet we live on; beaten,
and yet not killed;

sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having
nothing, and yet possessing everything...(2 Cor. 6:7-10) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

What a difference it makes to know Jesus! He cares for us in spite 
of what the world thinks. Christians don't have to give in to public
opinion and pressure...

Paul stood faithful to God whether people praised him or slandered
him. He remained joyous and content in the most difficult hardships...

We should not let circumstances or people's expectations control us.
We need to be firm as we stand true to God, and refuse to compromise
His standards for living...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for those times that I have not
remained as faithful as I should. I thank You for Your wondrous 
love in spite of my unfaithfulness. Bless now all my e-mail friends...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is always there for you...
You are in the prayer of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
