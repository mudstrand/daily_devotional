Our Bible Verses for Today:

Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade
men. What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your
conscience...

We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again, but are giving 
you an opportunity to take pride in us, so that you can answer those 
who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart...
(2 Cor. 5:11-12) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

What Paul is attempting to say is:

Those who "brag about having a spectacular ministry rather than 
having a sincere heart before God" are the false preachers 
(2 Cor. 2:17).

They are the preachers who were, and are, concerned only about 
getting ahead in this world. They were, and are, preaching the Good 
News for money and popularity...

Paul and his companions were preaching out of concern for eternity.
We can identify false preachers by finding out what really motivates
them...

If they are more concerned about themselves than about Christ,
avoid them and their message...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to remain more concerned about
the truth being shared with others than I am about my own needs.
Let me not be a stumbling block to my brothers and sisters in the 
Lord...Amen.

Keep looking up, and you will know the truth 
and the truth will set you free...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
