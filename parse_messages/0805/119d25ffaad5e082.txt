have a habit of making excuses...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

You see, at just the right time. when we were still powerless,
Christ died for the ungodly...

Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a 
good man someone might possibly dare to die...

But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we 
were still sinners, Christ died for us... (2 Cor. 5:6-8) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul was not afraid to die because He was confident of spending 
eternity with Christ...

Of course facing the unknown may cause us anxiety, and leaving 
loved ones hurts deeply, but if we believe in Jesus Christ, we can 
share Paul's hope and confidence of eternal life with Christ...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the guarantee all born-again
believers have in Christ Jesus. I pray that a revival would rise up in 
this country, so that we would receive further blessings from You.
Oh that this country would experience true peace again. I pray that 
the survivors of the hurricane would receive clean water and food
before more people die. I pray for a miracle...Amen.

Keep looking up, God still does miracles...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
