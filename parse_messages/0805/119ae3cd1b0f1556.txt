Our Bible Verses for Today:

We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed,
but not in despair; 

Persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.

We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that 
the life of Jesus may always be revealed in our body...

For we who are alive are always being given over to death for
Jesus sake, so that His life may be revealed in our mortal body.

So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in You...(2 Cor 4:8-12) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul reminds us that though we may feel we are at the end of our rope,
we are never at the end of hope...

Our perishable body is subject to sin and suffering, but God never abandons
us. Because Christ has won the victory over death, we have eternal life...

All our risks, humiliation, and trails are opportunities for Christ to demonstrate
His power and presence in and through us...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I often have felt as though I was at the
end of my rope, but as I recall Ps. 50:15 I am strengthened again,
for as You say in that text, "Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I
will deliver you, and you will honor me." So today once again I
give You thanks, for You are a Great and Awesome God...Amen

Keep looking up, for He is indeed a Great and Awesome God...
Your are in the prayers of two who care...
