Our Bible Verse for Today:

God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us,
so that in Him we might become the righteousness
of God. (2 Cor. 5:21) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

When we trust in Christ, we make an exchange: He takes
our sin and makes us right with God. Our sin was laid on
Christ at His crucifixion...

His righteousness is given to us at our conversion. This is 
what is meant by Christ's atonement for sin. In the world
bartering works only when two people exchange goods of 
similar value...

BUT God offers to trade his righteousness for our sin something
of immeasurable worth, for something completely worthless...

OH how grateful we should be for His kindness to us...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear heavenly Father, I do thank you for Your immeasurable love
that You were willing to make an atonement for my sin through the
blood of Christ. I pray for Your Holy Spirit's leading and guiding.
Help me to walk in a closer walk with thee...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will light your path...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
