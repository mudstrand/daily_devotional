Get this E-mail message sent around to your contacts ASAP.

PLEASE FORWARD THIS WARNING AMONG FRIENDS, FAMILY AND CONTACTS!

You should be alert during the next few days. Do not open any
message with an attachment entitled 'POSTCARD,' regardless of who
sent it to you. It is a virus which opens A POSTCARD IMAGE, which
'burns' the whole hard disc C of your computer. This virus will be
received from someone who has your e-mail address in his/her contact
list. This is the reason why you need to send this e-mail to all your
contacts It is better to receive this message 25 times than to
receive the virus and open it.

If you receive a mail called' POSTCARD,' even though sent to you by
a friend, do not open it! Shut down your computer immediately.

This is the worst virus announced by CNN. It has been classified by
Microsoft as the most destructive virus ever. This virus was
discovered by McAfee yesterday, and there is no repair yet for this
kind of virus. This virus simply destroys the Zero Sector of the Hard
Disc, where the vital information is kept.

COPY THIS E-MAIL, AND SEND IT TO YOUR FRIENDS. REMEMBER: IF YOU
SEND IT TO THEM, YOU WILL BENEFIT ALL OF US 

Take a moment to go to Snopes and check this out. Snopes lists
