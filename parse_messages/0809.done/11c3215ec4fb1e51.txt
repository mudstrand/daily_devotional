09/05/08~~~(food for thought)~~~People don't care how much you know,
until they know how much you care...(Phil. 2:3)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ...

Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed 
us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ...(Eph. 1:2, 3) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

"Who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms" 
means that in Christ we have all the benefits of knowing God ~

being chosen for salvation, being adopted as His children, forgiveness, insight, 
the gifts of the spirit, power to do God's will, the hope of living forever with Christ...

Because we have an intimate relationship with Christ, we can enjoy these blessings
now. 

The "heavenly realm" means that these blessings are eternal not temporal. The
blessings come from Christ's spiritual realm...

For more information on the heavenly realms in this letter look to 1:20, 2:6, 3:10.
These passages reveal Christ in His victorious, exalted role as ruler of all...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord Jesus, I thank You for the gift of grace that
You have bestowed upon each believer. I thank You for 
the many heavenly blessings that we receive through 
faith in You...Amen.

Keep looking up, He's got the whole world in His hands...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
