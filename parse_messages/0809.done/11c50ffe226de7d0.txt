09/11/08~~~(food for thought)~~~It takes more to plow a field than merely
turning it over in your mind...(I Thess. 4:11, 12)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

And He made known to us the mystery of His will according to His good 
pleasure, which He purposed in Christ,

to be put into effect when the times will have reached their fulfillment ~
to bring all things in heaven and on earth together under one head,
even Christ...(Eph. 1:9, 10) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

God was not intentionally keeping His plan secret, but His plan for the
world could not be fully understood until Christ rose from the dead...

His purpose for sending Christ was to unite Jews and Gentile in one
body with Christ as the head, Many people still do not understand 
God's plan; but at the right time, He will bring us together to be with
Him forever...

Then everyone will understand. On that day, all people will bow to 
Jesus as Lord, either because they love Him or because they fear
His power (See Phil. 2:10, 11).

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your wonderful plan to 
one day bring all people together to worship You the One True 
God. Help me become a better witness that I might have a hand
in making this message clear to more people...

Keep looking up, for Godly wisdom...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
