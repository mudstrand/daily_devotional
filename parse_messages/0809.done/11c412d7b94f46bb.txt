09/08/08~~~(Food for thought)~~~A man wrapped up in himself makes
a very small package...Pro. 18:2) NIV

Our Bible Verse for Today:

He predestined us to be adopted as His sons through Jesus Christ,
in accordance with His pleasure...(Eph. 1:5) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

He "predestined us" is another way of saying that salvation is God's
work and not our own doing. In His infinite love, God has adopted us 
as His own children...

Though Jesus' sacrifice, He has bought us into His family and made 
us heirs along with Jesus (Ro. 8:17). In Roman law adopted children
had the same rights and privileges as biological children. Even if they
had been slaves...

Paul uses this term to show how strong our relationship to God is. Have
you entered into this relationship with God?

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your infinite love,
for without Your plan I would be lost, for as Isaiah says
my works are but filthy rags. Bless all my e-mail friends 
with good health and safety this week...Amen.

Keep looking up, for you are in His plan...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
