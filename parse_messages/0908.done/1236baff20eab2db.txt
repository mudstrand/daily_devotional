08/30/09~~~food for thought~~~There is only one place to seek Godly wisdom ~~~
via God's Word...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Is not my Word like fire," Declares the Lord, "and like a 
hammer that breaks a rock in pieces?" (Jer. 23:29)

Our Lesson for Today:
What do you do with a hammer? ~~~ It depends doesn't it?

You can use it to tear down ~~~ or to build up?

When walls need replacement, first you hammer away at the old.
When its knocked down, you pound into place the new...

Its the same with fire ~~~ you can use it to destroy debris or to
ignite a jet engine...

Have you ever thought about God's Word as a hammer or a fire?

Like some hammer it pounds away the sin-hardened heart. Nothing
but the force of God's gospel can make a dent in an unbeliever's 
heart...

Only its mighty blows can tear down the unbelief that rules in the
sinful heart inherited from our parents ~~~ Like some fire God's 
gospel reduces to ashes the self -righteousness that packs the 
human heart...

Only the gospel's purifying flames get rid of the human instinct to
earn one's own salvation...

So let us not use God's Word like some unused tool on the 
workbench of life ~~~ Lets reach for this hammer and fire regularly...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, keep using You Word as a hammer and fire on me...Amen.
