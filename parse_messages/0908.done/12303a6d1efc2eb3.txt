089/10/09~~~food for thought~~~Remember according to Jesus, not believing
in Him is sin...

Our Bible Verses for Today: (words from Jesus)
"It is actually best for you that I go away, because if I don't, 
the Counselor won't come. If I do go away, He will come
because I will send Him to you...

And when He comes, He will convince the world of its sin,
and of God's righteousness, and the coming judgment...(Jn. 16:7, 8)

Our Lesson for Today:
We need to remember, that unless Jesus did what He came to do, 
there would be no Good News. If He did not die, He would not remove 
our sins; He could not rise again and defeat death...

If He did not go back to the Father the Holy Spirit would not come.
Christ's presence on earth was limited to one place at a time...

His leaving meant He could be present to the whole world through
the Holy Spirit...

There are three important task of the Holy Spirit:

(1) Convincing the world of its sin and calling it to repentance,
(2) Revealing the standard of God's righteousness to anyone 
who believes, because Christ would no longer be physically 
present on earth, and
(3) Demonstrating Christ's judgment over Satan...

Prayer Suggestion:
Lord, help us to be ever sensitive to Your Spirit's working in our 
heart, so that we would not sin against You...Help us to make this 
one aim of our desire and prayer...Amen.
