continuous prayer...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Repent (turn from your sins) and believe the good news." (Mk. 1:15)

Our Lesson for Today:
Repentance is not merely mouthing the words "I"m sorry."
Sometimes those words mean "I'm sorry that I got caught."
"I'm sorry that I am being punished."
"I'll be more careful next time so that I get away with it."
Or they can mean "I truly feel bad that I hurt you and I will not do it again."

The repentance which Jesus calls us to, is far more than a superficial feeling.
The word Jesus uses means a change of heart. Like with the cheating tax
collector Zacchaeus. 

Repentance means admitting our sins, recognizing the hurt we have caused
to our neighbor and Jesus, then making amends for those sins, and then fighting 
against them, (or turning from them)...

We need to understand the connect between repentance and salvation.

It is only those who truly repent of their sins that will find in the gospel the 
good news they need...

To those who don't feel their sins, repentance is only a term, not a treasure.
Before we can enjoy Jesus' forgiveness, we need to understand His call to 
repentance...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, change my heart by bringing me to repentance
so I might treasure Your forgiveness...Amen.
