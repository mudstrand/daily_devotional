08/28/09~~~food for thought~~~If you ask Jesus into your heart sin's
blemish will be removed...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
You forgave the iniquity of your people and covered
all their sins...(Ps. 85:2)

Our Lesson for Today:
Each of our sins are like some hideous scar on our soul.
It makes us ugly in the sight of a holy God...

Not only does God dislike what we look like, but He also 
has to banish us from His presence forever in that horrible
place called hell...

But our gracious God came up with a solution...

He asked His Son to take care of sin's horrible scars.
On the cross of Calvary, Jesus gave His all in payment
for all sin. He didn't just hide them with His hand. He did
radical surgery on them...

Yes this surgeon comes to each of us through His Word and
offers forgiveness to us. He even works faith in us so we can 
call Him our Savior...

Do you have any scars that our holy God will not tolerate, remember
He wants to remove them, all we have to do is ask Him to...

Prayer Suggestion:
Thank You Lord for removing my sins through Jesus' work. 
Cover me with His forgiveness so I can stand in beauty
before You...Amen.

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
