Hi!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~To be a child-of-God, one must obey...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Sorry about the last devo it should have been (I Cor 7:20)
but instead I typed (Jn.------ 7:20)...

Were you a slave when you were called? Don't let it trouble you ~
although if you can gain your freedom, do so,,,

For he who was a slave when he was called by the Lord is the
Lord's freeman; similarly, he who was a freeman when he was 
called is Christ's slave...(I Cor 7:21, 22) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Slavery was a common thing through-out the Roman Empire, Some
Christians in the Corinthian church were every likely slaves...

Paul said that even though they were slaves to other human beings,
they were free from the power of sin in their lives...

People today are slaves to sin until they commit their lives to Christ,
who alone can conquer sin's power. Sin pride, and fear no longer
have any claim on us, just as a slave owner no longer has power over
the slave he has sold...

The Bible tells us we become Christ's slaves when we become Christians,
but this actually mean we gain our freedom, because sin no longer controls us...

Our Prayer for Today:
I Thank you Lord for over powering sin in my
life ~ I thank you that I am no longer a slave
to sin, forgive me when I stumble, lead me in
Your path...Amen.

Keep looking up, for the guidance of your Master...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
