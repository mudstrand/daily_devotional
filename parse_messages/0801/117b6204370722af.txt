Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul says, But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so, A believing man or 
woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace...

How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do 
you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? (I Cor 7:15, 16) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

It is sad that this verse is miss used by some as a loophole to get out of 
marriage. Paul's statements were given to encourage the Christian spouse 
to try and get along with the unbeliever and make the marriage work...

But if, the unbelieving spouse insists on leaving, Paul said to let him or 
her go. The only alternative would be for the Christian to deny his or 
her faith to preserve the marriage, and that would be worse than dissolving 
the marriage...

Paul's chief purpose in writing this was to urge the married couples to seek 
unity, not separation... See (I Cor. 7:17; I Pet. 3:1-2)

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray for a loving heart and a 
Christ-like attitude toward all that I come into contact
with. Help me to always have a loving attitude toward
my family...Amen.

Keep looking up, He gives strength to the faithful...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
