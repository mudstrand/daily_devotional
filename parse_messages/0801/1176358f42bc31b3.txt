Hi You All!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Every good and perfect gift is from above...

Our Bible verses for Today:

I have written to you not to associate with sexually immoral people ~

Not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or
greedy and swindlers or idolaters. In that case you would have 
to leave the world ...

But now I am writing you that you must not associate with anyone 
who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an
idolater or a slanderer, a drunkard or a swindler. With such a man
do not even eat...(I Cor. 5:9-11) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul makes it clear that we should not disassociate ourselves from
unbelievers ~ otherwise we could not carry out Christ's command
to tell them about salvation (Mt. 28:18-20)...

But we are to distance ourselves from the person who claims to be a
Christian, yet indulges in sins that are forbidden in Scriptures...

Such people often rationalize there actions. When rationalizing sins a 
person harms others for whom Christ died and dims the image of God
in himself or herself...

A church who includes such person is hardly fit to be the light of the world.
To do so would distort the picture of Christ it is to present to the world...

Church leaders must be ready to correct, in love, for the sake of spiritual unity.

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to live in such a way as to be a light
for You. Bless all who read this devotion with good health and
safety. Be with those who mourn the lose of a loved one and give
strength to those who are undergoing cancer treatments...Amen.

Keep looking up, God's love still stands when all else has fallen...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
