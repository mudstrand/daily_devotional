Our Bible Verse for Today:

"Everything is permissible for me" ~ but everything is not beneficial.
Everything is permissible for me ~ but I will not be mastered by anything.
(I Cor. 6:12) NIV

"Our Lesson for Today:

Apparently the church had been quoting and misapplying the words
"I am allowed to do anything." Some of the Christians in Corinth were
excusing the sins by saying that:

(1) Christ had taken away all sin, and so they had complete freedom
to live as they pleased... or
(2) What they were doing was not strictly forbidden by Scripture...

Paul answered both these excuses:

(1) While Christ has taken away our sins, this does not give us freedom
to go on doing what we know is wrong...

The New Testament specifically forbids many sins (see 6:9, 10) that
we were originally prohibited in the Old Testament (see Romans 12:9-21, 
13:8-12).

(2) Some actions are not sinful in themselves, but they are not appropriate
because they can control our life and lead us away from God...

(3) Some action may hurt others. Anything we do that hurts rather than helps 
others is not right...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me if I have done anything
to hurt others in any way. Help me to be more sympathetic
to the needs of others...Amen.

Keep looking up, Your loving Heavenly Father
Never takes His eyes off you...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
