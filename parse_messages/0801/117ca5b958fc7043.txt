Hi All!!!~~~(food for thought~~~Since our heart is the temple of the Holy Spirit ~ keep it clean...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Each one should remain in the situation which 
he was in when God called him...(Jn. 7:20) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

We may become so concerned about what we could be doing
for God somewhere else that we miss opportunities right where 
we are...

Paul says when you become a Christian, you should continue 
doing the work you have done all along ~ provided it is not immoral
or unethical...

Every job can become Christian work when you realize that it 
can be an opportunity to honor ~ serve ~ and speak out for Christ...

Because God has placed you where you are ~ take advantage
of every opportunity to serve Him...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to remain satisfied
where you have put me. Help me to seek every opportunity 
to share the good news with all whom I come across ~
I pray this in Jesus name...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will share with you, the opportunities He has for a you...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
