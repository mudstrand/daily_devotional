Hi!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Blest be the tie that binds...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

By His power God raised the Lord from the dead, and He will raise us also.

Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ Himself?
Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute?
Never!

Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with
her in body? For it is said, "The two will become one flesh...

But He who unites himself with the Lord is one with him in spirit...(I Cor. 6:14-17) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

This teaching about sexual immorality and prostitutes was especially 
important for the Corinthian church because the temple of the love 
goddess Aphrodite was in Corinth...

This temple employed more than a thousand prostitutes as 
priestesses, and sex was a part of the worship ritual...

Paul clearly stated that Christians are to have no part in sexual 
immorality even if it is acceptable and popular in our culture...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, as You know there is so much
immorality that has crept into our society today. I pray
that there would be a revival in our country and that our
society would once again seek to live by the moral
standards spoken of in your word...Amen.

Keep looking up, He wants to show you the heavenly ways...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
