Blessings to you!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~The Bible will tell you what is wrong
before you have done it...

Our Bible verse for Today:

Run away from sexual sin! No other sin so clearly affects the body as this
one does. For sexual immorality is a sin against your own body...(I Cor. 7:18) NLT

Our Lesson for Today:

Remember, Christians are free to be all they can be for God ~ BUT they
are not free from God...

God created sex to be a beautiful and essential ingredient of marriage ~
BUT sexual sin ~~ sex outside the marriage relationship, always hurts
someone.

It hurts God because it shows that we prefer following our own desires
instead of the leading of the Holy Spirit...

It hurts others because it violates the commitment so necessary to a
relationship. It often brings disease to our bodies, and it deeply affects 
our personality, which responds in anguish when we harm ourselves
physically and spiritually...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for all my sins, my sins of
thought, word, and deed. Cleanse me from all unrighteousness
for I ask it in Jesus name...Amen.

Keep looking up, for the cleansing power...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
