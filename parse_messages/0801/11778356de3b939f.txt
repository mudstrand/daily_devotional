Our Bible Verses for Today:

If any of you has a dispute with another, dare he take it before
the ungodly for judgment instead of before the saints?

Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? and if you
are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial 
cases? (I Cor 6:1, 2) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

In chapter 5 Paul explained what to do with open sin in the congregation.

In chapter 6 he teaches how the congregation should handle small problems 
between believers...

Society has set up a legal system in which disagreements can be resolved
in courts...

But Paul declares that Christians should not have to go to a secular court to
resolve their differences...

As Christians we have the Holy Spirit and the mind of Christ, so why should
we turn to those who lack godly wisdom? Because of all we have been given
as believers, and because of the authority that we will have in the future to
judge the world and the angels, we should be able to deal with disputes among
ourselves...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that you would instill in me godly wisdom.
Help me to judge fairly in all things. Give me a loving attitude, I pray
in Jesus name...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will give you courage...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
