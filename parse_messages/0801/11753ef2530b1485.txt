Have a Blessed Week!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~True faith never gives up...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul says, Some of you have become arrogant, as if I 
were not coming to you...

But I will come to you very soon, if the Lord is willing,
and then I will find out not only how these arrogant 
people are talking, but what power they have...

For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of
power...(I Cor. 4:18-20) NIV

Our Lesson From These Verses:

Some people talk a lot about faith, but that is all it is ~ talk.
They might know all the right words to say, but their lives
don't reflect God's power...

Paul says that the Kingdom of God is to be lived, not just
discussed...

There is a big difference between knowing the right words
and living them out. Don't be content to have the right 
answers about Christ. Let your life show that God's power
is really working in you...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to live out my faith each 
and every day. Forgive me for not always being the best
witness I can be. Help me to live a more Christ-like life...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will give you the power...
You are in the Prayers of two who care...
