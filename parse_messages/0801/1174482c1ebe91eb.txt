Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul said, "Dear brothers and sisters, I have used Apollos and
myself to illustrate what I've been saying. If you pay attention to
the Scriptures, you won't brag about one of your leaders at the
expense of another...

What makes you better than anyone else? what do have that 
God hasn't given you? And if all that you have is from God, why
boast as though you have accomplished something on your own?" 
(I Cor. 4:6, 7) NLT

Our Lesson From These Verses Today:

How easy it is for us to become attached to certain spiritual leaders.
When someone has helped us, it is natural for us to feel loyal...

But Paul warns against having such pride in our favorite leaders, 
because that will cause division in the church...

Any true spiritual leader is a representative of Christ and has nothing
to offer that God hasn't given him or her...

Don't let your loyalty cause strife, slander, or broken relationships.
Make sure that your deepest loyalties are to Christ and not to his
human agents...

Those who spend more time debating church leadership than declaring 
Christ's message don't have the mind of Christ...

Our Prayer for Today;
Dear Heavenly Father, I do dearly thank you for the 
spiritual leaders here on earth that teach Your truths
to us, but help me to remember not to lift them to 
high. Instead Help me to remember it is You and
only You who are worthy of our praise...Amen.

Keep looking up, to our Great and Awesome God...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
