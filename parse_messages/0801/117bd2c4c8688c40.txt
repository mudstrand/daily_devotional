STROKE: Remember The 1st Three Letters.... S.T.R. 










My nurse friend sent this and encouraged me to post it and spread the word. I agree. 

If everyone can remember something this simple, we could save some folks. Seriously.. 

Please read: 

STROKE IDENTIFICATION: 

During a BBQ, a friend stumbled and took a little fall - she assured everyone that she was fine (they offered to call paramedics) .....she said she had just tripped over a brick because of her new shoes. 

They got her cleaned up and got her a new plate of food. While she appeared a bit shaken up, Ingrid went about enjoying herself the rest of the evening. 

Ingrid's husband called later telling everyone that his wife had been taken to the hospital - (at 6:00 pm Ingrid passed away.) She had suffered a stroke at the BBQ. Had they known how to identify the signs of a stroke, perhaps Ingrid would be with us today. Some don't die.... they end up in a helpless, hopeless condition instead. 

It only takes a minute to read this... 

A neurologist says that if he can get to a stroke victim within 3 hours he can totally reverse the effects of a stroke... totally . He said the trick was getting a stroke recognized, diagnosed, and then getting the patient medically cared for within 3 hours, which is tough. 

RECOGNIZING A STROKE 
Thank God for the sense to remember the '3' steps, STR . Read and Learn! 

Sometimes symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify. Unfortunately, the lack of awareness spells disaster. The stroke victim may suffer severe brain damage when people nearby fail to recognize the symptoms of a stroke . 


Now doctors say a bystander can recognize a stroke by asking three simp le questions: 
S * Ask the individual to SMILE. 
T * Ask the person to TALK and SPEAK A SIMPLE SENTENCE (Coherently) 
(i.e. It is sunny out today) 
R * Ask him or her to RAISE BOTH ARMS. 

If he or she has trouble with ANY ONE o f these tasks, call 999/911 immediately and describe the symptoms to the dispatcher. 

New Sign of a Stroke -------- Stick out Your Tongue 

NOTE: Another 'sign' of a stroke is this: Ask the person to 'stick' out his tongue.. If the tongue is 'crooked', if it goes to one side or the other , that is also an indication of a stroke. 

A cardiologist says if everyone who gets this e-mail sends it to 10 people; you can bet that at least one life will be saved.
