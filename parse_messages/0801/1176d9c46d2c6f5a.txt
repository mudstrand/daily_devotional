Have a Blessed Week-end!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~God wants to be our helper...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church?
Are you not to judge those inside...

God will judge those outside. "Expel the wicked man from 
among you." (I Cor. 5:12, 13) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

The Bible constantly tells us not to criticize people by gossiping
or making rash judgments. At the same time, however we are
to judge and deal with sin that can hurt others...

Paul's instruction should not be used to handle trivial matters or
to take revenge; nor should they be applied to individual problems
between believers...

These verses are instructions for dealing with open sin in the church 
by a person who claims to be a Christian and yet sins without remorse.
The church is to confront and discipline such persons in love...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for my sins and 
give me godly wisdom and a Christ-like love if I
have to discipline another person. Bless all who
read this devotion and may they have a safe and 
healthy week-end...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is waiting for Your call...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
