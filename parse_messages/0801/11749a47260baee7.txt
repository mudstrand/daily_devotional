Have A Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~God stretches our patience to
enlarge our soul...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Paul says:
"I am not writing this to shame you, but to warn you as my
children...

Even though you have ten thousand guardians in Christ,
you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became
your Father through the Gospel...

Therefore I urge you to imitate me...(I Cor. 4:12-16) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul is tell the Corinthians to follow his example. He was able to
make this statement because he walked close to God, spent time
in God's Word and in prayer, and was aware of God's presence
in his life at all times...

God was Paul's example, therefore, Paul's life could be an example
to other Christians. Paul wasn't expecting others to imitate everything 
he did, but they should imitate those aspects of his beliefs and conduct
that were modeling Christ's way of living...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that You would forgive me for
not always living a Christ-like life. Help me live a life pleasing 
to You. Bless all my e-mail friends with good health and safety...Amen.

Keep looking up, seeking to hear what He has to say...
You are in the Prayers of two who care...
