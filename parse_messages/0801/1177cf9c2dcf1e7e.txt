Have A Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~God chooses what we go through
we choose how we go through it...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul says ~ I say this to shame you. is it possible that there is nobody
among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers?

But instead, one brother goes to law against another ~ and this in front
unbelievers!

The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been 
completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not 
rather be cheated?

Instead you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your
brothers...(I Cor. 6:5-8) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Why did Paul say that Christians should not take their disagreements
to unbelievers in secular courts?

(1) If the judge and jury are not Christians, they are not likely to be 
sensitive to Christian values...

(2) The basis for going to court is often revenge; this should never
be a Christian's motive.

(3) Lawsuits harm the cause of Christ and make the church look bad,
causing unbelievers to focus on its problems rather than on its purpose.

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your Word, help me
set a good Christian example with my actions. Forgive me
for not always setting a Christ-like example. I pray that you
will bless all who read this devotion with good health and 
safety today...Amen.

Keep looking up, and your grief will turn to gain...
You are in the Prayers of two who care...
