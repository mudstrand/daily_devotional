Have A Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Our strength is made perfect 
in weakness. (2 Cor. 12:9)

Our Bible Verse for Today:

"Food for the stomach, and stomach for food" ~ but God will
destroy both. The body is not meant for sexual immorality,
but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body...(I Cor. 6:13) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Sexual immorality is a temptation that is always before us. In movies
and on TV, sex outside marriage is treated as a normal, even desirable
part of life...

Marriage is often shown as confining and joyless. We can even be 
looked down on by others if we are suspected of being pure...

But God does not forbid sexual sin just to be difficult. He knows
its power to destroy us physically and spiritually...

No one should underestimate the power of sexual immorality. It has
devastated countless lives and has destroyed families, churches,
communities, and even nations...

God wants to protect us from damaging ourselves and others, and
so He offers to fill us ~ our loneliness ~ and our desires ~ with Himself...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, instill in me a pure heart, cleanse me from 
all unrighteousness. I pray that you would give me the strength to
say no to all temptations...Amen.

Keep looking up, and He will guide You in 
the way of righteousness...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
