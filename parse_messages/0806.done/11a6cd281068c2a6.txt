starting at the bottom, except when learning to swim...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Now He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will
also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the 
harvest of your righteousness...(2 Cor. 9:10) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

God gives us resources to use and invest for Him...

Paul uses the illustration of seed to explain that the resources
God gives us are not to be hidden ~ foolishly devoured ~ or
thrown away...

Instead ~ they should be cultivated in order to produce more
crops...

When we invest what God has given us in His work He will provide
us with even more to give in His service...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the many blessings You 
have provided me with, give me wisdom to use these gifts wisely
to further Your Kingdoms work...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will guide your way...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
