Our Bible Verse for Today:

Paul has just said that God would not remove his thorn in the flesh
as he calls it...(Paul says)

That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weakness, in insults, in
hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak,
then am I strong...(2 Cor. 12:10) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

When we are strong in abilities or resources, we are
tempted to do Gods work on our own, and that can 
lead to pride...

When we are weak, allowing God to fill us with His power, 
then we are stronger than we could ever be on our own,,,

God does not intend for us to be weak, passive, or ineffectual,
Life provides enough hindrance and set-backs without us 
creating them...

When those obstacles come we must depend on God. Only
His power will make us effective for him...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, help me to remember to turn all
my problems over to you, guide and direct my life I pray...
Amen.

Keep looking up, He is always there for you...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
