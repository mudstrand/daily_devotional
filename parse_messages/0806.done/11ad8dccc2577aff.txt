06/30/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ Beware of false doctrine

Our Bible verse for today:

I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one 
who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a
different gospel...(Gal 1:6) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Some people were preaching "a different way." They were
teaching that to be saved, Gentile believers had to follow
Jewish laws and customs, especially the rite of circumcision...

They were preaching that faith in Christ was not enough. This
message undermined the truth that salvation is a gift, not a reward
for certain deeds. Jesus Christ has made this gift available to all
people...

Beware of people who say that we need more than simple faith in 
Christ to be saved. When people set up additional requirements 
for salvation, they deny the power of Christ's death on the cross
(see Gal. 3:1-5).

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, I thank You for the gift of salvation that is ours
through faith in the finished work of Christ on the cross.
Make this clear to all who read this today...Amen.

Keep looking up, God has a blessing for you today...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
