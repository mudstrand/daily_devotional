time making connections with the ears...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith;
test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is 
in you ~ unless of course, you fail the test? (2 Cor. 13:5) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

The Corinthians were called to examine and test themselves to see
if they were really Christians...

Just as we get physical check ups, Paul urges us to give ourselves
spiritual checkups. We should look for a growing awareness of Christ's
presence and power in our life...

We need this checkup to see if we are true Christians or merely 
impostors. If we are not actively seeking to grow closer to God, 
we are drawing father away from Him...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that You would help me to make
an honest examination of my spiritual health. Open my spiritual 
eyes to any sins that I am unaware of...Amen.

Keep looking up, for His guidance...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather...
