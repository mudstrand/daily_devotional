06/18/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~All our dreams can come true if 
we have the courage to pursue them...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul was especially concerned for these new churches 
because of the many false teachers, he says:

"besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my
concern for all the churches...

Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin,
and I do not inwardly burn? (2 Cor. 11:28, 29) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Not only did Paul face beatings and dangers, he also carried
the daily concern for the young churches. He worried whether
they would stay true to the Good News and free from false
teachings, and inner strife...

Paul was concerned for individuals in the churches he had served.

If God has place you in a position of leadership and authority
treat people with Paul's kind of empathy and concern...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord Jesus, Help me remember to keep Your people
in my prayers. Help me to always be faithful in reaching out
to those who need to know You...Amen.

Keep looking up, from where our strength comes...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
