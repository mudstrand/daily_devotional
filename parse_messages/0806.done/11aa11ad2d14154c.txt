a most becoming light on others...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was 
caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the 
body or out of the body I do not know~~God knows.

And I know that this man ~ whether in the body or apart 
from the body I do not know but God knows,

was caught up into paradise. He heard inexpressive things, 
things that man is not permitted to tell...(2 Cor 12:2-4) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul continued his "boasting" by telling about visions
and revelations he had received from the Lord, Paul
explained that he didn't know if he was taken up in his
body or in his spirit...

This incident cannot be positively identified with a
recorded event in Paul's career, although some think
this may have been when he was stoned and left for
dead (Acts 14:19, 20).

Our Lesson for Today:

The reason Paul told about this incident was to show
that he had been uniquely touched by God....

Suppose you had, had such an experience could you
explain it any better that Paul?

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear heavenly Father, I thank You for Paul's experience.
It is not to difficult to imagine that he was speechless because
of the sounds and the beauty of the place that has been
prepared for us. Help us to be prepared for our departure...Amen.

Keep looking up, He has prepared a place for you...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
