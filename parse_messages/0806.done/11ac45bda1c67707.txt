06/26/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ Life is just on foolish thing after another, and
love is just one foolish thing after each other...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

We can not do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.

We are glad whenever we are weak but you are strong; and
our prayer is for your projection...(2 Cor 13:8, 9) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Just as parents want their children to grow into mature adults,
so Paul wanted the Corinthians to grow into mature Christians...

As we share the Good News, our goal should be not merely
to see others profess faith or begin attending church but to
see them become mature in their faith...

Don't set your sights too low...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, help me to be faithful to share the
Good News ~ so that others will mature in their faith. Bless 
each of my e-mail friends with safety and good health...Amen.

Keep looking up, in faith and love...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
