06/27/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ If you really think about it, life is nothing but
an experiment that we are all new at...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Finally, brothers, good-by. Aim for perfection, listen to my
appeal, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love 
and will be with you...(2 Cor. 13:11) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul's closing words ~ what he wanted the Corinthians to remember
about the needs facing their church ~ are still fitting for the church today.

When these qualities are not present, there are problems that will have
to be dealt with. These traits do not come to a church by glossing over
problems, conflicts, and difficulties...

They are not produced by neglect, denial, withdrawal, or bitterness. They
are the by-products of the extremely hard work of solving problems...

Just as Paul and the Corinthians had to hammer out difficulties to bring 
peace, so we must apply the principles of God's Word and not just hear 
them...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help our church to be of one mind,
help us to live in peace. Help us to be like minded. help
us to scrap all ideas that we can not come to a consensus
about...Amen.

Keep looking up, for Godly wisdom...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
