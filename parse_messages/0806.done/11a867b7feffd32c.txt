06/14/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ The first and most important step toward
success is the feeling that we can succeed...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Paul says: "I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by
the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led 
astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ...
(2 Cor. 11:3) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

The Corinthians pure and simple devotion to Christ was being
threatened by false teaching. Paul did not want the believers 
to lose their singe-minded love for Christ...

Keeping Christ first in our life can be very difficult when we have
so many distractions threatening to sidetrack our faith. Just as Eve 
lost her focus by listening to the Serpent, we too can lose our focus
by letting our life become overcrowded and confused...

Is there anything that weakens your commitment to keep Christ first
in your life?

What are someways you can minimize the distractions that threaten 
your devotion to Christ???

Keep looking up, keep your focus totally on Him...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
