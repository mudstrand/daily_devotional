but after awhile they know something...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

For though we live in the world we do not wage war as the world does...

The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. on the
contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds...

We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up
against the knowledge of God and we take captive every thought
to make it obedient to Christ...(2 Cor 10:3-5) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

We, like Paul, are merely weak humans, but we don't need to use
human plans and methods to win our battles...

God's mighty weapons are available to us as we fight against the 
devils "strongholds." the Christian must choose whose methods to
use ~ God's or the world's...

Paul assures us that God's mighty weapons ~ prayer, faith, hope, 
love, God's Word, the Holy Sprit ~ are powerful and effective
(see Eph. 6:12-18)...

These weapons can break down the proud human arguments
against God and the walls that Satan builds to keep people from 
finding God...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the weapons that are 
available to all Christians to break down Satan's barriers to
God. I thank you for that power...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will make available to you 
the power to overcome Satan's attacks...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
