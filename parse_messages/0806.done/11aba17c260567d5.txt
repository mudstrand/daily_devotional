for people they can't see...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul writes: "I am afraid that when I come I may not find you 
as I want you to be, and you may not find me as you want me
to be. I fear that there may be quarreling, jealousy, outburst 
of anger, factions, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder...

I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me 
before you, and I will be grieved over many who have sinned
earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual sin and 
debauchery in which they have indulged...(2 Cor. 12:20, 21) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

After reading this list of sins, it is hard to believe that these are
the people that Paul said possessed great gifts and excelled
as leaders (8:7)...

Paul feared that the practices of wicked Corinth had invaded the 
congregation. He wrote sternly, hoping that they would straighten 
out their lives before he arrived...

This should be a warning to us who believe, not to let the secular 
society dictate how we are to treat others. We should not let 
culture influence our behavior...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, help me to heed Paul's warning to
stay clear of secular behavior.Forgive me for the sins I 
have committed. Bless each and every e-mail friend today
with good health and safety...Amen.

Keep looking up, your path to guide...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
