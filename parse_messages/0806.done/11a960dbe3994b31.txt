THIS IS QUITE INTERESTING. a GREAT READ!! 








Your Social Security 

Just in case some of you young whippersnappers (& some older ones) didn't know this. It's easy to check out, if you don't believe it. Be sure and show it to your kids. They need a little history lesson on what's what .and it doesn't matter whether you are Democrat of Republican. Facts are Facts!!! 

Our Social Security 

Franklin Roosevelt , a Democrat, introduced the Social 

Security (FICA) Program. He promised: 

1.) That participation in the Program would be 

Completely voluntary, 

2.) That the participants would only have to pay 

1% of the first $1,400 of their annual 

Incomes into the Program, 

3.) That the money the participants elected to put 

Into the Program would be deductible from 

Their income for tax purposes each year, 

4.) That the money the participants put into the 

Independent 'Trust Fund' rather than into the 

General operating fund, and therefore, would 

Only be used to fund the Social Security 

Retirement Program, and no other 

Government program, and, 

5.) That the annuity payments to the retirees 

Would never be taxed as income.



Since many of us have paid into FICA for years and are 

Now receiving a Social Security check every month -- 

And then finding that we are getting taxed on 85% of 

The money we paid to the Federal government to 'put 

Away' -- you may be interested in the following: 

------------------------------------------------------------- 

Q: Which Political Party took Social Security from the 

Independent 'Trust Fund' and put it into the 

General fund so that Congress could spend it? 

A: It was Lyndon Johnson and the democratically 

Controlled House and Senate. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Q: Which Political Party eliminated the income tax 

Deduction for Social Security (FICA) withholding? 

A: The Democratic Party. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Q: Which Political Party started taxing Social 

Security annuities? 

A: The Democratic Party, with Al Gore casting the 

'tie-breaking' deciding vote as President of the 

Senate, while he was Vice President of the US . 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Q: Which Political Party decided to start giving 

Annuity payments to immigrants? 

AND MY FAVORITE: 

A: That's right! Jimmy Carter and the Democratic Party. 

Immigrants moved into this country, and at age 65, 

Began to receive Social Security payments! The 

Democratic Party gave these payments to them, 

Even though they never paid a dime into it! 

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Then, after violating the original contract (FICA), the Democrats turn around and tell you that the Republicans want to take your Social Security away! 

And the worst part about it is uninformed citizens believe it! 



If enough people receive this, maybe a seed of 

Awareness will be planted and maybe changes will 

Evolve. Maybe not, some Democrats are awfully 

Sure of what isn't so. 

But it's worth a try. How many people can 

YOU send this to? 

Actions speak louder than bumper stickers. 

AND CONGRESS GIVES THEMSELVES 100% RETIREMENT FOR ONLY SERVING ONE TERM!!!
