Our Bible Verses for Today:

(a continuation of our last devotion) Paul says:
I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even
beyond their ability. Entirely on their own,

They urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in
the service to the saints...

And they did not do as we expected, but they gave themselves 
first to the Lord and then to us in keeping with God's will...

So we urged Titus, since he had earlier made a beginning, to
bring also to completion this act of grace on your part...(2 Cor 8:3-6) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

We should realize that the Kingdom of God spreads through 
believers concern and eagerness to help others. Here we see 
several churches joining to help others beyond their own circle
of friends and their own city...

We should explore ways that we can link up with a ministry outside
our own city, either through our church or through a Christian
organization. By joining with other believers to do God's work we
increase Christian unity and help the kingdom grow...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me not to be so concerned about
myself, and more concerned about the welfare of others. Show
me ways to share the blessing I have received with others less
fortunate. Bless those who are reading this devotion by helping
them to see the needs of others...Amen

Keep looking up, it is the best way to gain true wisdom...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
