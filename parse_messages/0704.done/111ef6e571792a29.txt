HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~If you get to thinkin' you're a person of some influence,
try orderin' somebody else's dog around...

Our Meditation for Today:

See to it that no one misses the grace of God and that no 
bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many...(Heb. 12:15) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Like a small root that grows into a great tree, bitterness springs up 
in our hearts and over-shadows even our deepest Christian relationships.

A "bitter root" comes when we allow disappointment to grow into resentment,
or when we nurse grudges over past hurts...

Bitterness brings with it jealousy, dissension, and immorality. When the Holy
Spirit fills us, however, he can heal the hurt that causes bitterness...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, Help me to get rid of all bitterness
let no evil thought dwell within me. O Lord help
me to have a forgiving heart, lead me in paths
of righteousness...Amen.

Keep looking up, with your eyes on the SON...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather

Let us worship the Lord together this Sabbath...
