HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Some minds are like concrete thoroughly 
mixed up and permanently set...

Our Meditation for Today:

Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings.
It is good for our hearts to be strengthened by grace, not
by ceremonial foods, which are of no value to those who
eat them...(Heb. 13:9) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

apparently some were teaching that keeping the Old Testament 
ceremonial laws and rituals (such as not eating certain foods) was
important for salvation...

But these laws were useless for conquering a person's evil thoughts
and desires (Col. 2:23). Laws can influence conduct, but they can 
not change the heart...

Lasting changes in conduct begin when the Holy Spirit lives in each
person...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the work of the Holy Spirit.
I pray that I would always be sensitive and obedient to His leading
and guiding. Guide and protect our troops. I pray that the insurgents
would have a change of heart and see that living in peace with one
another will make for a brighter future...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
