This is sent especially with ladies in mind, but it is also something
for the men to think about:

Put your car keys beside your bed at night. If you hear a noise outside
your home or if someone is trying to get in your house, just press
the panic button for your car. The alarm will be set off, and the horn
will continue to sound until either you turn it off or the car battery dies.

Next time you come home for the night and you start to put your keys
away, think of this: It's a security alarm system that you probably
already have and requires no installation.

Test it. It will go off from most everywhere inside your house and will keep
honking until your battery runs down or until you reset it with the button 
on
the key fob chain.

It works if you park in your driveway or garage.

If your car alarm goes off when someone is trying to break in your
house, odds are the burglar or rapist won't stick around...after a few
seconds all the neighbors will be looking out their windows to see who
is out there and sure enough the criminal won't want that.

And remember to carry your keys while walking to your car in a parking lot.
The alarm can work the same way there!

This is something that should really be shared with everyone. Maybe it
could save a life or a sexual abuse crime.

This tip came from a neighborhood watch coordinator.
