HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~The Good Lord didn't create anything without
a purpose, but mosquitoes come close...

Our Meditation for Today:

Keep on loving each other as brothers.~~Do not forget
to entertain strangers, for by so doing some people have
entertained angels without knowing it...(Heb. 13:1, 2) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Real love for others produces tangible actions. In vs. 2 we
see hospitality to strangers...

In the Old Testament three people "entertained angels without 
realizing it." (1) Abraham (Gen. 18:1ff, (2) Gideon (Jud. 6:11ff)
(3) Manoah (Jud. 13:2ff)...

Some people say they cannot be hospitable because their homes 
are not large enough or nice enough...

But if you have no more than a table and two chairs in a rented 
room, there are people who would be grateful to spend time in
your home...

Are there visitors to your church with whom you could share a 
meal?

Do you know single people who would enjoy an evening of 
conversation?

Is there anyway your home could meet the needs of traveling
missionaries?

Hospitality simply means making other people feel comfortable
and at home...

Our Prayer:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that my love would run deep
enough to affect my hospitality, empathy, fidelity, and contentment.
Instill within me a sympathizing heart for the needs of others...
Bless my e-mail friends with good health and safety today...Amen.

Keep looking up. with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
