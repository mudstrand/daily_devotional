HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~We are all called to be witnesses, not lawyers or judges...

Our Meditation for Today:

Obey your leaders and submit to their authority. They keep watch
over you as men who must give an account. Obey them so that
their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no 
advantage to you...(Heb. 13:17) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

The task of church leaders is to help people mature in Christ...

Cooperative followers greatly ease the burden of leadership...

Does your conduct give your leaders reason to report joyfully about you???

Or are they thinking of opting out come the next election???

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, help me to always remember my church 
leaders in my prayers. Bless them and give them wisdom
in managing the affairs of the church. Help me to be sensitive 
to their feelings and more helpful when volunteers are needed.

Bless now my e-mail friends with good health and safety...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
