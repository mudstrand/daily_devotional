HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Sometimes you get, and sometimes you get got...

Our Meditation for Today:

In your struggle against sin, you have not yet
resisted to the point of shedding your blood...
(Heb. 12:4) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Some of us may be facing difficult times. Some of us
may even be facing persecution, but none off us have
had to die for our faith...

Because we are still alive, the writer urges us to continue
the race. Just as Christ did not give up, neither should we...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, forgive me for complaining about my struggles,
for I have very little to complain about. I have never suffered 
the persecution that You suffered. Give me the strength
needed to continue the race that is set before me. Help me
to follow the example You set before me...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
