HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~I don't know why some people change churches; what 
difference does it make which one you stay home from...

Our Meditation for Today:

The Jewish Christians because of their witness to the Messiah,
no longer worshiped with other Jews, they were to consider their
praise and acts of service their sacrifice--ones which they could
offer anywhere at anytime...

This probably reminded them of the prophet Hosea's words. 
"Forgive all our sins and graciously receive us, so that we 
may offer you the sacrifice of praise." (Hosea 14:2)

A "sacrifice of praise" today would include thanking Christ for
His sacrifice on the cross and telling others about it...

Acts of kindness and sharing are particularly pleasing to God,
even when they go unnoticed by others...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for all my sins and receive 
my offer of praise and thanksgiving for the sacrifice Christ made 
for me on that old rugged cross. I pray that my acts of sharing
would be pleasing to You...

Bless my e-mail friends with good health and safety today...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
