HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Quit griping about your church; if it was perfect, 
you couldn't belong...

Our Meditation for Today:

Remember your leaders, who spoke the Word of God
to you. consider the outcome of their way of life and
imitate their faith...(Heb. 13:7) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

If you are a Christian, you owe much to others who have taught 
you and modeled for you what you need to know about the Good
News and Christian living...

We need to continue following the good examples of those who 
have invested themselves in us by investing in our life through
evangelism, service, and Christian education...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that my life would become 
a model for others to follow. I thank You for the teachers
that have guided me and shown me how I should conduct
my life...

Bless my e-mail friends today...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
