===================================================================
Body (clean, unformatted):
===================================================================
JESUS

IN CHEMISTRY, HE TURNED WATER TO WINE.

IN BIOLOGY, HE WAS BORN WITHOUT THE NORMAL CONCEPTION.

IN PHYSICS, HE DISPROVED THE LAW OF GRAVITY WHEN HE 
ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN.

IN ECONOMICS, HE DISPROVED THE LAW OF DIMINISHING RETURN BY
FEEDING 5,000 MEN WITH TWO FISHES & 5 LOAVES OF BREAD.

IN MEDICINE, HE CURED THE SICK AND THE BLIND, WITHOUT
ADMINISTERING A SINGLE DOSE OF DRUGS.

IN HISTORY, HE IS THE BEGINNING AND THE END.

IN GOVERNMENT, HE SAID THAT HE SHALL BE CALLED WONDERFUL
COUNSELOR, PRINCE OF PEACE.

IN RELIGION, HE SAID NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT
THROUGH HIM.

JESUS HAD NO SERVANTS, YET THEY CALLED HIM MASTER; HAD NO
DEGREE, YET THEY CALLED HIM TEACHER; HAD NO MEDICINES, YET THEY 
CALLED HIM HEALER.

HE HAD NO ARMIES, YET RULERS FEARED HIM.

HE WON NO MILITARY BATTLES, YET HE CONQUERED THE WORL

HE COMMITTED NO CRIME, YET THEY CRUCIFIED HIM.

HE WAS BURIED IN A TOMB, YET HE LIVES TODAY.
******
I FEEL HONORED TO SERVE SUCH A MAGNIFICIENT LEADER AND ONE WHO LOVES US SO MUCH HE WAS WILLING TO TAKE OUR PUNISHMENT FOR SINS ONTO HIMSELF!

JOIN US AND LET'S CELEBRATE HIM THIS EASTER; BECAUSE HE IS WORTHY.
******
THE EYES BEHOLDING THIS MESSAGE SHALL NOT BEHOLD EVIL, 
THE HAND THAT WILL SEND THIS MESSAGE TO EVERYBODY, SHALL NOT LABOR IN VAIN, AND THE MOUTH SAYING AMEN TO THIS PRAYER, SHALL SMILE FOREVER.

REMAIN IN GOD AND SEEK HIS FACE ALWAYS.

AMEN & HAPPY EASTER
