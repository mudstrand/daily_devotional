Minnesota College to Use Taxpayer Dollars to Promote Islam, But Strongly Forbids Christianity

Contact Your State Legislators Today! 

Dear Donna, 


The Minneapolis Community and Technical College, a public institution, says it has a strict policy of not promoting religion or favoring one religion over another. But that seems to depend on your religion. 

Where Christianity is concerned, the college goes to great lengths to avoid any hint of what the courts call "entanglement" or support of the church. Yet the college is planning to install facilities for Muslims to use in preparing for daily prayers, an apparent first at a public institution in Minnesota. 

Religious discrimination is clearest at the college during the Christmas season. A memo from President Phil Davis, dated Nov. 28, 2006, exhorted supervisors to banish any public display of holiday cheer: "As we head into the holiday season ... "all public offices and areas should refrain from displays that may represent to our students, employees or the public that the college is promoting any particular religion." Departments considering sending out holiday cards, the memo added, should avoid cards "that appear to promote any particular religious holiday." 

Last year, college authorities caught one rule-breaker red-handed. A coffee cart that sells drinks and snacks played holiday music "tied to Christmas," and "complaints and concerns" were raised, according to a faculty e-mail. College authorities quickly quashed the practice. 

They appear to take a very different attitude toward Islam. The college is making plans to use taxpayer funds to install facilities for ritual foot-washing and using taxpayer money to make improvements to facilitate one group's prayer. 

Issues surrounding the intersection of church and state and religious accommodation are complex. But the college's treatment of Christianity and Islam seems to reflect a double standard. 

Take Action 
Send an email to your state legislators, asking him or her to insure Minneapolis Community and technical College does not use taxpayer money to promote Islam while censoring Christians. A copy of your email will be sent to Minneapolis Community and Technical College President, Phil Davis.
