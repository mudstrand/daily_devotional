HAVE A NICE DAY:~~~(food for thought)~~~Peace starts with a smile...

Our Meditation for Today:

The high priests carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy
Place as a sin offering, but the bodies are burned outside the camp.

And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gates to make the people
holy through His own blood...

Let us, then. go to Him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace He bore...
(Heb. 13:11-13) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

The Jewish Christians were being ridiculed and persecuted by
the Jews who didn't believe in Jesus the Messiah...

Most of the book of Hebrews tells them how Christ is greater
than the sacrificial system...

Here the writer drives home the point of his lengthy argument;
it may be necessary to leave the "camp" and suffer with Christ.

To be outside the camp meant to be unclean--in the days of the 
Exodus, those who were ceremonially unclean had to stay out 
side the camp. But Jesus suffered humiliation and uncleanness
outside the Jerusalem gates on their behalf...

The Time had come for Jewish Christians to declare their loyalty
to Christ above any other loyalty, to choose to follow the Messiah
whatever suffering, that might entail...

They needed to move out side the safe confinement of their past,
their traditions, and their ceremonies to live for Christ...

What has been holding you back from complete loyalty to Jesus Christ.

Our Prayer for Today:
Thank You Lord for the sacrifice You made on my behalf
that I might inherit eternal life. I pray that I would forever
remain faithful to You. Bless my e-mail friends with good
health and safety...Amen.

Keep looking up, to the Son!!!
You're in the prayers of two who care...
