HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Lettin' the cat outta the bag is a whole lot 
easier than puttin' it back in...

Our Meditation for Today:

Make every effort to live in peace with all men and to be holy; 
without holiness no one will see the Lord...(Heb. 12:14) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Sin always blocks our vision of God; so if we want to see God,
we must renounce sin and obey Him...

Holiness is coupled with living in peace. A right relationship with
God leads to a right relationship with fellow believers. Although 
we will not always feel loving toward other believers, we must 
pursue peace as we become more Christ-like...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that I would always be 
sensitive to the feelings of others, so that I would not
cause bitterness between me and other believers.
forgive me for focusing on material thing when my
focus should be on You...

May the Light of Jesus shine on all my e-mail friends...Amen.

Keep looking up, toward the "SON"...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
