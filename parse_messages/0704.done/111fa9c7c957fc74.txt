Some of you probably have seen this one before, but
I think that from time to time we ought to rexamine our
thinking about others...It also doesn't hurt to see what
others have overcome and see that there is also hope
for ourselves...


Subject: True Story -- Worth Reading!!!

A friend sent me this and I got the chills. This is so touching. We
never know when God is working through us.

Robby's Night True Story --Worth Reading!!!

At the prodding of my friends, I am writing this story.

My name is Mildred Hondorf. I am a former elementary school music teacher
from Des Moines, Iowa I've always supplemented my income by teaching
piano lessons-something I've done for over 30 years.

Over the years I found that children have many levels of musical ability.
I've never had the pleasure of having a prodigy though I have taught some 
talented
students. However I've also had my share of what I call "musically
challenged" pupils.

One such student was Robby. Robby was 11 years old when his mother
(a single Mom) dropped him off for his first piano lesson.
I prefer that students (especially boys!) begin at an earlier age, which I
explained to Robby. But Robby said that it had always been his mother's
dream to hear him play the piano. So I took him as a student.

Well, Robby began with his piano lessons and from the beginning I thought
it was a hopeless endeavor. As much as Robby tried, he lacked the sense of 
tone
and basic rhythm needed to excel. But he dutifully reviewed his scales and
some elementary pieces that I require all my students to learn.

Over the months he tried and tried while I listened and cringed and tried 
to
encourage him. At the end of each weekly lesson he'd always say,
"My mom's going to hear me play someday." But it seemed hopeless. He just
did not have any inborn ability.

I only knew his mother from a distance as she dropped Robby off or waited
in her aged car to pick him up. She always waved and smiled but never 
stopped in.

Then one day Robby stopped coming to our lessons. I thought about calling 
him
but assumed because of his lack of ability, that he had decided to pursue 
something else.
I also was glad that he stopped coming. He was a bad advertisement for my 
teaching!

Several weeks later I mailed to the student's homes a flyer on the upcoming 
recital.
To my surprise Robby (who received a flyer) asked me if he could be in the 
recital.
I told him that the recital was for current pupils and because he had 
dropped out he really
did not qualify.

He said that his mother had been sick and unable to take him to piano 
lessons but
he was still practicing "Miss Hondorf I've just got to play!" he insisted.

I don't know what led me to allow him to play in the recital.
Maybe it was his persistence or maybe it was something inside of me saying
that it would be all right.

The night for the recital came. The high school gymnasium was packed with 
parents,
friends and relatives. I put Robby up last in the program before I was to 
come up and
thank all the students and play a finishing piece. I thought that any damage 
he would do
would come at the end of the program and I could always salvage his poor
performance through my "curtain closer."

Well, the recital went off
without a hitch. The students had been practicing and it showed. Then Robby
came up on stage. His clothes were wrinkled and his hair looked like he'd
run an eggbeater through it.

"Why didn't he dress up like the other students?" I thought.
"Why didn't his mother at least make him comb his hair for this
special night?"

Robby pulled out the piano bench and he began. I was surprised when he 
announced
that he had chosen Mozart's Concerto #21 in C Major. I was not prepared for 
what I heard next.

His fingers were light on the keys, they even danced nimbly on the ivories. 
He
went from pianissimo to fortissimo. From allegro to virtuoso. His suspended
chords that Mozart demands were magnificent! Never had I heard Mozart
played so well by people his age.

After six and a half minutes he ended in a grand crescendo and everyone was 
on their
feet in wild applause. Overcome and in tears I ran up on stage and put my 
arms around
Robby in joy.

"I've never heard you play like that Robby! How'd you do it?"
Through the microphone Robby explained: "Well Miss Hondorf . .. Remember
I told you my ` Mom was sick? Well, actually she had cancer and passed away
this morning And well .. . . She was born deaf so tonight was the first
time she ever heard me play. I wanted to make it special."

There wasn't a dry eye in the house that evening. As the people from Social 
Services led
Robby from the stage to be placed into foster care, noticed that even their
eyes were red and puffy and I thought to myself how much richer my life had
been for taking Robby as my pupil.

No, I've never had a prodigy but that night I became a prodigy.of Robby's.
He was the teacher and I was the pupil for it is he that taught me the 
meaning
of perseverance and love and believing in yourself and maybe even taking a 
chance
in someone and you don't know why.

Robby was killed in the senseless bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal 
Building
in Oklahoma City in April of 1995.

And now, a footnote to the story If you are thinking about forwarding this 
message,
you are probably thinking about which people on your address list aren't
the "appropriate" ones to receive this type of message.

The person who sent this to you believes that we can all make a difference. 
So many
seemingly trivial interactions between two people present us with a choice: 
Do we act
with compassion or do we pass up that opportunity and leave the world a bit
colder in the process?

You have two choices now: 1. Delete this. or 2. Forward it to the people you 
care about.
You know the choice I made.

Thank you for reading this May God bless you today,tomorrow and
always ********* If God didn't have a purposes for us. We wouldn't be here!
