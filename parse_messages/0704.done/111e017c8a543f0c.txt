HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~The biggest troublemaker you'll probably ever have to deal with,
watches you from the mirror every mornin'.

Our Meditation for Today:

No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful.
Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness
and peace for those who have been trained by it...(Heb. 12:11) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

We may respond to discipline in several ways:
(1) We can accept it with resignation.
(2) We can accept it with self-pity, thinking we really didn't deserve it.
(3) We can be angry and resentful toward God. OR
(4) We can accept it gratefully as the appropriate response we owe a loving Father...

Best of all, ask the Father what He is trying to teach you!!!

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, help me to be sensitive to what You are 
trying to teach me this day, so that I would become
a faithful follower. Bless my e-mail friends today with
good health and safety...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
