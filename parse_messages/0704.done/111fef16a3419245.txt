HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Many people want to serve God, but only as advisors...

Our Meditation for Today:

You have not come to a mountain that can be touched 
and that is burning with fire; to darkness, gloom and storm;

to a trumpet blast or to such a voice speaking words that
those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken
to them,

because they could not bear what was commanded; "If 
even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned."

The sight was so terrifying that Moses said, "I am trembling
with fear."

But you have come to Mount Zion, to the heavenly Jerusalem,
the city of the living God. You have come to thousands upon 
thousands of angels in joyful assembly...(Heb. 12:18-22) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

What a contrast between the people's terrified approach to God
at Mount Sinai and their joyful approach at Mount Zion!!!

As Christians we are citizens of the heavenly Jerusalem right
now; Because Christ rules our lives, the Holy Spirit is always 
with us, and we have a close relationship with other believers...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father I thank You for the difference
Jesus has made! Before He came You seemed so
distant and threatening. But now since He came we
can feel your welcome through Christ's presence in
us. Thank You Lord for this wonderful fellowship...

Bless my e-mail friends with healing and good health...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
