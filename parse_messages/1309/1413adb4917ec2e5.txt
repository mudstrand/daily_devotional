Today's Verse: Psalms 12:1 (NLT)

1 Help, O Lord, for the godly are fast disappearing! The faithful have
vanished from the earth! 

Today's Thoughts:

This is a thought that may come to our minds too. Yes living for God in a
deceitful world

can be difficult and lonely battle. At one time the great prophet Elijah
felt so lonely He

wanted to die. But God told him that there were 7,000 other faithful
servants (I Kg. 19:4, 14, 18)



Let us remember we are never alone in our battle against evil-when you feel
alone seek out

other believers for strength and support. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Thank Lord, for being close at hand when I find myself in a battle against
evil.

You are my strength and ever present help in times of trouble. . . Amen.

I will thank the Lord because He is just;

I will sing praises to the name of the Lord Most High. Ps. 7:17
