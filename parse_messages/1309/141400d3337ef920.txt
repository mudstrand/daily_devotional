Today's Verse: Psalms 12:5 (NLT)

5 The Lord replies, "I have seen violence done to the helpless, and I have
heard the groans of the poor. 

Now I will rise up to rescue them, as they have longed for me to do." 



Today's Thoughts: 

Oh yes, we need not fear, God cares about the helpless. Here we see that He
promises to rescue the 

helpless and confront their oppressors. Shouldn't we identify with God's
attitude? His work is not 

done until we care for the needs of the poor.



Let us remember to have faith in God's timing-But let us also be faithful in
fulfilling our part in the

care of those less fortunate.



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

I thank you Lord, for Your faithfulness! Help me to remain faithful to Your
commands. 

Help me to be more caring of those who are less fortunate. . Amen.

I Cor. 3:20 The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are
worthless.
