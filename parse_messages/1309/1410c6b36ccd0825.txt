Today's Verses: Psalms 9:11-14 (NLT)

11 Sing praises to the Lord who reigns in Jerusalem. Tell the world about
his unforgettable deeds.

12 For he who avenges murder cares for the helpless. He does not ignore the
cries of those who suffer. 
13 Lord, have mercy on me. See how my enemies torment me. Snatch me back
from the jaws of death.

14 Save me so I can praise you publicly at Jerusalem's gates, so I can
rejoice that you have rescued me. 



Today's Thoughts:

God does not only live in Jerusalem (or Zion, another name for Mount Moriah,
the hill on which the temple was built);

He lives everywhere all the time. . . From this central point the Jews were
to tell the world about the one true God.



All of us want God to help us when we are in trouble, but often for
different reasons. 

Some people want God to help them so they will be successful and other
people will

like them. Others want God to help them so they will be comfortable and
feel good

about themselves. 



David wanted help from God so that justice would be restored to Israel and
so he could

show others God's power.



When you call to God for help, consider your motive. Is it to save yourself
pain and

embarrassment or to bring God glory and honor? 



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father Help me to be sensitive to Your Holy Spirits guidance
so that

my motives would always be just, so that my requests would only be to give
you honor 

and glory. . . Amen.
