Today's Verses: Psalms 9:19-20 (NLT)

19 Arise, O Lord! Do not let mere mortals defy you! Judge the nations!

20 Make them tremble in fear, O Lord. Let the nations know they are merely
human. 



Today's Thoughts:

If you are facing battles you feel you can't possible win, don't give up.

In the midst of numerous problems, pray for God's help, admit to Him

that you are powerless. . .



The secret of victory is to first admit to the futility of unaided human
effort

and then to trust God to save. His power works best through those who 

recognize their limitations (2 Cor. 12:9).



It is those who think they can do it all, on their own who are in the
greatest danger. . . 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord forgive me for the times I have attempted to take on difficult
situations and 

failed because I did not trust in You for the help I needed. Help me see my
limitations.Amen.
