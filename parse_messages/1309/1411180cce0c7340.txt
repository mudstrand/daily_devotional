Today's Verses: Psalms 9:16-18 (NLT)
16 The Lord is known for his justice. The wicked are trapped by their own
deeds. 
17 The wicked will go down to the grave. This is the fate of all the nations
who ignore God.
18 But the needy will not be ignored forever; the hopes of the poor will not
always be crushed. 

Today's Thoughts:
The Lord alone is our only hope. The Lord knows our every need, He will not
remain silent 
forever. He will come to the aid of all who call upon Him.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:
I thank You O Lord, that You Love and care for Your people. Let not my
enemies triumph 
over me. Open my eyes that I may see all the wonders thy hands have made. .
. Amen.
