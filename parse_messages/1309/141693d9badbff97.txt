Today's Verses: Psalms 15:1-2 (NLT)

Who may worship in your sanctuary, Lord? Who may enter your presence on your
holy hill?

2 Those who lead blameless lives and do what is right, speaking the truth
from sincere hearts. 

Today's Thoughts:

God calls His people to be morally upright. As we work through chap. 15 He
gives us 10 

standards to determine how we are doing. We defiantly live among sinful
people whose 

standards and morals are eroding. . .



Our standards for living should not come from our sinful society but from
God. 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, I pray for a sincere and sensitive heart that I may be led by
Your

Holy Spirit-in the way of righteousness. I pray that I would not become

led by the sinfulness of today's society. I pray that revival would come to

our country so that our society would once again seek Your truth for all
people. . . Amen.
