Today's Verses: Psalms 11:5-7 (NLT)

5 The Lord examines both the righteous and the wicked. He hates those who
love violence.

6 He will rain down blazing coals and burning sulfur on the wicked,
punishing them with scorching winds.

7 For the righteous Lord loves justice. The virtuous will see his face. 



Today's Thoughts:

We've probably all have discovered the fact that God does not always
preserve believers from difficult circumstances.

BUT He examines (or tests) both the righteous and the wicked. For
some-God's tests become a refining fire-

while for others, the tests become an incinerator for destruction.



Don't ignore or defy the tests and challenges that come your way-use them as
opportunities to grow. . .

God is still in control. . . 



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

I thank You Lord, for Your love and mercy for You have guided and protected
me from

many difficult circumstances. Because of this fact my faith in You has
grown.

I pray for the health and safety of all who read this e-mail. . . Amen.
