Today's Verses: Psalms 13:1-5 (NLT)
O Lord, how long will you forget me? Forever? How long will you look the
other way?
2 How long must I struggle with anguish in my soul, with sorrow in my heart
every day? How long will my enemy have the upper hand? 
3 Turn and answer me, O Lord my God! Restore the sparkle to my eyes, or I
will die.
4 Don't let my enemies gloat, saying, "We have defeated him!" Don't let them
rejoice at my downfall. 
5 But I trust in your unfailing love. I will rejoice because you have
rescued me. 
Today's Thoughts:
(Sometimes)-all we need to do is talk over our problem with a friend to help
put it into perspective.
David frequently claimed that God was slow to react on his behalf. I believe
we too often feel this
same impatience. Often it seems that evil and sufferings go unchecked, and
we wonder when God 
is going to stop them. But David affirmed that he would continue to trust
God no matter how long 
he would have to wait for God's justice to materialize. . .

Through prayer we can express our feelings and take our problems to God. He
will help us regain 
the right perspective, and this will give us peace of mind.
Today's Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, You have been so patient with me. You continued to draw me to
Your forgiving heart.
Grant that I may learn from You to be patient with others thoughtful and
considerate, even though 
they irritate and upset me. Remove from my heart all resentment toward
those who upset me by 
their words and actions. Let me lean on You for strength and guidance and
wait on Your time. . . Amen.
