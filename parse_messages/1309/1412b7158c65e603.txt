Today's Verses: Psalms 10:13-14 (NLT)

Why do the wicked get away with despising God? They think, "God will never
call us to account."

14 But you see the trouble and grief they cause. You take note of it and
punish them. The helpless put their trust in you. You defend the orphans. 



Today's Thoughts"

God sees and take note of each evil deed-He encourages us, and listens to
our cries.

He fulfills the desires of those who fear Him; He hears their cries for help
and rescues them.

He is always with us-We can face the wicked because we do not face them
alone-

God is by our side.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

I thank You Lord for Your faithfulness. I thank You that You hear our cries
and come to our aid. . . Amen.

I Cor. 3:20 The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are
worthless.
