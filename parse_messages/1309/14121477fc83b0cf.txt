Today's Verses: Psalms 10:4-6 (NLT)

4 The wicked are too proud to seek God. They seem to think that God is dead

5 Yet they succeed in everything they do. They do not see your punishment
awaiting them. They sneer at all their enemies.

6 They think, "Nothing bad will ever happen to us! We will be free of
trouble forever!" 



Today's Thoughts:

Some people succeed in everything they do, and they brag that no one, not
even God,

can keep them down. We may wonder why God allow them to gain great wealth,

while they despise Him as they do. 



BUT why are we upset when the wicked prosper?

Are we angry about the damage they are doing, or just jealous of their
success?

To answer these questions, we must gain the right perspective on wickedness
and wealth.

The wicked will surely be punished because God hates their evil deeds.

Wealth is only temporary, it is not necessarily a sign of God's approval on
a person's life,

nor a lack of it a sign of God's disapproval. . . Don't let wealth become
your obsession



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, help me to always have the right perspective of situations in
life that are

cloudy to me. Help me remember that the riches of this life are only
temporary.

Help me set my sights on the eternal riches You wish for me. . . Amen.
