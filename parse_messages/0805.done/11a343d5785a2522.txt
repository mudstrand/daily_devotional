Thank U Jw

I DIDN'T KNOW !!!





















I didn't know!



How could we?




Did you know that 47 countries' have



reestablished their embassies in Iraq ?



Did you know that the Iraqi government



currently employs 1.2 million Iraqi people?




Did you know



that 3100 schools have been renovated,



364 schools are under rehabilitation,



263 new schools are now under construction;



and 38 new schools have been completed in Iraq ?



Did you know



that Iraq 's higher educational structure consists



of 20 Universities, 46 Institutes or colleges and 4 research centers,



all currently operating?



Did you know



that 25 Iraq students departed for the United States in 
January 2005 for the re-established Fulbright program?



Did you know



that the Iraqi Navy is operational?



They have 5 - 100-foot patrol craft,



34 smaller vessels and a naval infantry regiment.



Did you know



that Iraq ' s Air Force consists of three operational squadrons,



Which includes 9 reconnaissance and 3 US C-130 transport aircraft



(under Iraqi operational control) which operate day and night,



and will soon add 16 UH-1 helicopters and 4 Bell Jet Rangers?



Did you know



that Iraq has a counter-terrorist unit and a Commando Battalion?



Did you know



that the Iraqi Police Service has over 55,000



fully trained and equipped police officers?



Did you know



that there are 5 Police Academies in Iraq



that produce over 3500 new officers every 8 weeks?



Did you know



there are more than 1100 building projects going on in Iraq ?



They include 364 schools, 67 public clinics, 15 hospitals,



83 railroad stations, 22 oil facilities, 93 water facilities



and 69 electrical facilities.



Did you know



that 96% of Iraqi children under the age of 5



have received the first 2 series of polio vaccinations?



Did you know



that 4.3 million Iraqi children were enrolled in primary school by mid October?



Did you know



that there are 1,192,000 cell phone subscribers in Iraq



and phone use has gone up 158%?



Did you know



that Iraq has an independent media that consists of



75 radio stations, 180 newspapers and 10 television stations?



Did you know



that the Baghdad Stock Exchange opened in June of 2004?



Did you know



that 2 candidates in the Iraqi presidential election had a 
televised debate recently?



OF COURSE WE DIDN'T KNOW!



WHY DIDN'T WE KNOW?



BECAUSE OUR MEDIA WON'T TELL US!



Instead of reflecting our love for our country,



we get photos of flag burning incidents at Abu Ghraib



and people throwing snowballs at the presidential motorcades.



Tragically, the lack of accentuating the positive



in Iraq serves two purposes:



It is intended to undermine the world's perception



of the United States thus minimizing consequent support;



and it is intended to discourage American citizens.
