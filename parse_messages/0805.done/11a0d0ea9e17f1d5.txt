05/22/08 ~~~~~~ I will be out of town Fri. & Sat so there won't be any devotion.

Our Bible Verse for Today:

We put no stumbling block in anyone's path, so that
our ministry will not be discredited...(2 Cor. 6:3) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

In everything Paul did, he always considered what his actions
communicated about Christ. If you are a believer you are a 
minister for God...

In the course of each day, unbelievers observe you. Don't let 
your careless or undisciplined actions be some person's excuse
for reject Christ...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord Jesus help me to bridal my tongue and actions
so that I would not be a stumbling block to someone. Bless 
and keep my e-mail friends safe and healthy...Amen.

Keep looking up, for daily guidance...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
