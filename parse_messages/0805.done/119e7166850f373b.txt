Our kids insist that I should send this early in case someone wanted to plan 
their vacation for Greenbush around the fourth... Greenbush usually has a big 
celebration on the fourth with a parade of old cars, tractors, horses, and floats. 


Aldyn and Brenda Sather ~ Rick and Trish Sather ~ and Tracy Nelson, invite you to share in the 50th wedding 

anniversary of their parents, Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather, on July the 5th. Although their anniversary is 

June 4th, we are having a community celebration in July, hoping that many of their family and friends will be able 

to join them for the celebration.



We are planning a reception at ~ United Free Lutheran Church on "Old Ridge Road" in Greenbush Minnesota 

on the 5th from 1-4 and will be serving a light lunch. Our parents will conclude their celebration by taking an 

Amtrak train ride around the United States, (destinations unknown), beginning in September and ending in October.



Hope to see you all...
