How To Forgive


One day a while back, a man, his heart heavy with grief, was walking
in the woods. As he thought about his life this day, he knew
many things were not right. He thought about those who had lied about
him back when he had a job.

His thoughts turned to those who had stolen his things and cheated him.



He remembered family that had passed on. His mind turned to the
illness he had that no one could cure. His very soul was filled
with anger, resentment and frustration.



Standing there this day, searching for answers he could not find,
knowing all else had failed him, he knelt at the base of an old oak
tree to seek the one he knew would always be there. And with
tears in his eyes, he prayed:


'Lord- You have done wonderful things for me in this life.
You have told me to do many things for you, and I happily obeyed. 
Today, you have told me to forgive. I am sad, Lord, because I cannot. I
don't know how.



It is not fair Lord. I didn't deserve these wrongs that were done
against me and I shouldn't have to forgive. As perfect as your way is 
Lord, this one thing I cannot do, for I don't know how to
My anger is so deep Lord, I fear I may not hear you, but I pray that you
teach me to do this one thing I cannot do - Teach me To Forgive.'


As he knelt there in the quiet shade of that old oak tree, he felt
something fall onto his shoulder. He opened his eyes. Out of the corner 
of one eye, he saw something red on his shirt.



He could not turn to see what it was because where the oak tree had
been was a large square piece of wood in the ground. He raised his head
and saw two feet held to the wood with a large spike through them.


He raised his head more, and tears came to his eyes as he saw Jesus
hanging on a cross. He saw spikes in His hands, a gash in His side, a
torn and battered body, deep thorns sunk into His head. Finally he saw
the suffering and pain on His precious face. As their eyes met, the
man's tears turned to sobbing, and Jesus began to speak.



'Have you ever told a lie?' He asked?



The man answered - 'yes, Lord.'



'Have you ever been given too much change and kept it?'



The man answered - ' yes. Lord.' And the man sobbed more and more.

'Have you ever taken something from work that wasn't yours?' Jesus asked?



And the man answered - 'yes, Lord.'



'Have you ever sworn, using my Father's name in vain? '



The man, crying now, answered - 'yes, Lord.'



As Jesus asked many more times, 'Have you ever'? The man's crying
became uncontrollable, for he could only answer - 'yes, Lord.'



Then Jesus turned His head from one side to the other, and the man
felt something fall on his other shoulder. He looked and saw
that it was the blood of Jesus. When he looked back up, his eyes met
those of Jesus, and there was a look of love the man had never seen
or known before.


Jesus said, 'I didn't deserve this either, but I forgive you.'


It may be hard to see how you're going to get through something, 
but when you look back in life, you realize how true this statement is.
