05/21/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ A drowning man does not complain about 
the size of a life preserver. (Phil. 2:14)

Our Bible Verse for Today:

For He says, "In the time of My favor I heard you. and in the day
of salvation I helped you." I tell you, now is the time of God's favor,
now is the day of salvation...(2 Cor. 6:2)

Our Lesson for Today:

God offers salvation to all people. Many people put off a decision for
Christ, thinking there will be a better time ~ BUT they could miss their 
opportunity all together...

There is no time like the present to receive God's forgiveness. Don't
let anything hold you back from coming to Christ...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You again for the assurance 
of salvation. I pray Lord for a revival once again in this country. 
I pray for the safety of this nation and our troops. I pray for wisdom
for our countries leaders both federal, state, and local, give wisdom
to our military leaders too...Amen.

Keep looking up, keep our nation in prayer...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
