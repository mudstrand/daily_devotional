Our Bible Verses for Today:

While we are in this tent (body) we groan and are burdened, 
because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed 
with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be 
swallowed up by life...

Now it is God who has made us for this very purpose and has
given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.
(2 Cor. 5:4, 5) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

The Holy Spirit within us is our guarantee that God will give us
an everlasting body at the resurrection (2 Cor. 1:22). We have 
eternity in us now!!!

This truth should give us great courage and patience to endure 
anything we might have to experience...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for the promise that 
one day I will receive an everlasting body. A body that
will not experience tears or sorrows, pain or suffering.
I pray this in Jesus name...Amen.

Keep looking up, true wisdom comes from Him...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather...
