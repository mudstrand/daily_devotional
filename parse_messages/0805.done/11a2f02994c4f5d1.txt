before you know how little you know...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness
and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with
darkness?

What harmony is there between Christ and Beliah? What does a believer 
have in common with an unbeliever?

What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we 
are the temple of the living God. As God has said: "I will live with them
and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be My people"

"therefore come out of them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no 
unclean thing, and I will receive you."

"I will be a Father to you, and you will be My sons and daughters," says the 
Lord Almighty... (2 Cor. 6:14-18) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul urges believers to not form partnerships with unbelievers
because this might weaken their Christian commitment, integrity, 
or standards...

It would be a mismatch. Earlier, Paul explained that this did not 
mean isolating oneself from unbelievers (see 1 Cor. 5:9, 10)...

Paul even urged Christians to stay with their unbelieving spouses
(1 Cor. 7:12, 13). Paul wanted Christians to be active in their witness
for Christ to unbelievers but not to lock themselves into personal or
business relationships that could cause them to compromise their
faith...

Believers should do everything in their power to avoid situations that
could force them into dividing their loyalties...

Our Prayer for Today
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to be sensitive to Your Holy
Spirits leading so that I would be aware of opportunities of
witness for You. Help me to remain faithful so as to not 
be drawn into dividing my loyalty to You...Amen.

Keep looking up, that you may remain loyal to Him...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
