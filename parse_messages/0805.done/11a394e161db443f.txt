05/30/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ There is no mistake so great as 
that of being always right...

Our Bible verses for Today:

Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it.
Though I did regret it ~ I see that my letter hurt you, but only
for a little while ~

yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry,but
because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became
sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any 
way by us...

Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and 
leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death...
(2 Cor. 7:8-10) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Sorrow for our sins can result in changed behavior. Many people 
are sorry only for the effects of their sins or for being caught 
("sorrow without repentance")...

Sometime compare Peter"s remorse with Judas's bitterness and
the act of suicide. Both denied Christ. One repented and was 
restored to faith and service: the other took his own life...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for allowing us to come to You
openly seeking Your divine forgiveness for our sins through Jesus 
Christ. Help me become more sensitive to my sinful nature...Amen.

Keep looking up, He wants to protect You from Satan's cleverness.
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
