05/06/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ Let the wise listen and add to their learning (Pro. 1:3)...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but what is unseen.
For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.
(2 Cor 4:18)...

Our Lesson for Today:

Our ultimate hope when we are experiencing a terrible illness, 
persecution, or pain is the realization that this life is not all there
is ~

Let us remember there is life after death! Having the assurance
that we will live forever with God in a place without sin and suffering 
can help us live above the pain we face in this life...

Let us pray that we will be joined by all our family members in that place...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord Jesus I thank You for the promise of a better life
after death ~ a place prepared by You ~ a place where there 
will be no more sin and pain ~ where we will live with You forever...Amen.

Keep looking up, He promises to give us peace...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather...
