05/17/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ You can't take your money with you,
but you can send it on ahead...(Mt.6:19, 20)

Our Bible Verse for Today:

We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though
God were making His appeal through us. We implore
you on Christ's behalf; Be reconciled to God...(2 Cor 5:20) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

An ambassador is an official representative of one country to another.

As believers, we are Christ's ambassadors, sent with His message
of reconciliation to the world...

An ambassador of reconciliation has an important responsibility. We 
dare not take this responsibility lightly. How well are you fulfilling
your commission as Christ's ambassador...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that You would forgive me of my sins
of thought word and deed ~ my sins of omission and commission.
Help me to fill my responsibility as You ambassador...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will guide you...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
