Body (clean, unformatted):

05/29/08 ~~~ food for thought) ~~~ A guilty person runs when no one is chasing him...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves
from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness
out of reverence for God...(2 Cor. 7:1) NIV

Our lesson for Today:

Purifying ~~ or cleansing is a twofold action ~~ 
First: it is a turning away from sin ~~
Second: It is a turning to God...

Perfecting Holiness: is the process of becoming more like Christ...
The process will not become complete until we meet Christ face
to face...

But knowing that it is our ultimate destiny should motivate us to 
purify ourselves...

Yes to purify means to keep morally straight, free from the
corruption of sin. God also purifies us, but there is action we
must take to remain morally fit ~~ (see I Tim 5:22; Jm. 4:8; 1 Pet. 1:22)

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, guide and direct me in paths of righteousness
that I might become more Christ-like. Forgive me of my short-comings
so that one day I will meet Christ face-to-face...Amen.

Keep looking up, and receive His purifying power...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
