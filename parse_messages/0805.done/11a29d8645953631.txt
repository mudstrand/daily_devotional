05/27/08 ~~~ Food for thought ~~~ Do the thing you fear and the
death of fear is certain...(Deut. 31:6)

Our Bible Verses For Today:

We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, and opened wide our hearts to you...

We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours
from us...

As a fair exchange ~ I speak as to my children ~ open wide your hearts also...
(2 Cor. 6:11-13) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

"Our hearts are open to you" means that Paul had told the Corinthian
believers his true feelings for them, he had told them clearly how 
much he loved them...

The Corintians were reacting coldly to Paul's words, but Paul explained
that his harsh words came from his love for them. It is easy to react 
against whom God has placed over us in leadership ratter than to accept
their advise as a sign of their love for us...

We need an open ratter than a closed heart toward God's message...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to be more receptive to 
Your leading and guiding. Help me to have a sensitive 
heart and spirit to Your Word I pray in Jesus name...Amen.

Keep looking up, He wants to show you the way...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
