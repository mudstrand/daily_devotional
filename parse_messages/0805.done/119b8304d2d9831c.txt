Our Bible Verse for Today:

Therefore do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, 
yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day...(2 Cor. 4:16) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Sometimes it is very easy to lose heart and quit...

We have all had problems in our relationships or in our work that
have caused us to think about giving up. BUT rather than quitting 
when persecution wore him down, Paul concentrated on the inner 
strength that came from the Holy Spirit (Eph. 3:16)...

Don't let fatigue, pain or criticism force you off the job. renew your
commitment to serving Christ. Don't forsake your eternal reward
because of the intensity of today's pain...

Your very weakness allows the resurrection power of Christ to strengthen
you moment by moment...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for throwing up my hands
and giving into the trials of the day. Help me to remember
that in You there is an abundance of strength for those who
will call upon You...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will carry you through...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
