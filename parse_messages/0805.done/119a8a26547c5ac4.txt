Our Bible Verse for Today:

But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this
all-surpassing power is from God and not from us...
(2 Cor. 4:7) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

The valuable treasure we have is the message of salvation
in Jesus Christ, which has been entrusted by God to us frail
human beings (jars of clay)...

We see that Paul's focus, was not on the perishable container 
but on its priceless contents ~ God's power dwelling in us...

Though we are weak, God uses us to spread His Good News,
and He gives us power to do His work. Knowing the power is His, 
not ours, should keep us from pride and motivate us to keep
daily contact with God, our power source...

Our responsibility is to let people see God through us...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for another day of grace,
I pray that today I would be sensitive to Your Holy Spirit's 
leading. I pray that my actions today would reflect my love
for You in such a way that others would be drawn to You,
I pray for that power Amen...

Keep looking up, and He will give you the power...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
