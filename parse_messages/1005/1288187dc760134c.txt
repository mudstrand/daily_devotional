Our Bible Verse for Today:
Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man,
"My son, your sins are forgiven." (Mk. 2:5)

Our Lesson for Today:
Before saying to the man, "Get up," Jesus said, "Your sins are forgiven." To the Jewish leaders 
this statement was blasphemous, claiming to do something only God could do. According to the 
law, the punishment for this sin was death. (Lev. 24:15, 16)...

The Jewish leaders understood correctly that Jesus was claiming a divine position, but their
judgment of Him was wrong. Jesus was not blaspheming because His claim was true. Jesus
is God, and He proved it by healing the paralyzed man. (Mk. 2:9-12)...

So as we pray for those for whom the doctor says, "There is no hope." Let us pray, 
"We commend this brother/sister into Your care and keeping." For there is always
hope in the Lord...(Mk. 5:35, 36) 

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, our Divine Physician, dispense the medicine
of Your forgiveness and heal my heart every day...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
