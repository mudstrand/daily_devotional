05/26/2010 ~~~food for thought~~~OUR LIVES WORK FOR CHRIST...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Paul writes, "It has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and 
to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ..." (Phil. 1:13)

Our Lesson for Today:
Paul could no longer plant new mission congregations and prepare more mission workers,
But he could still talk about Jesus, and he did. Every six to eight hours another guard would
come to relieve the guard whom Paul was chained...

There is no telling how many guards Paul told about Jesus during his two years in custody 
at Rome. The laugh's on Satan who thought that chaining Paul up would curtail his preaching
of Christ. But Paul used it as another opportunity to work for Christ...

We need to remember that it is not just the pastor who has a pulpit from which to preach
Christ, so do we. Our pulpit is called daily life. Our walk is heavenward, but on the way 
there's work for us to do...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, make me a faithful witness to the Savior so
that others may walk with me to heaven...Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
