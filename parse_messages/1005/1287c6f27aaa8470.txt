05/09/2010~~~food for thought~~~WORSHIP WITH HEART AND MIND...

The verse I am sending to you today was sent to me yesterday as home-work by a faithful
cousin. She gives me a verse or two each day and it being Sunday today I thought it was a 
fitting verse for the day...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Jesus said, "These People honor me with there lips, but their hearts are far away. 
Their worship is a farce, for they replace God's commands with their own man-made
teachings." (Mt. 15:8, 9)

Our Lesson for Today:
If you go to Isa. 29:13 you will see that Isaiah criticized the hypocrites of his day, and
Jesus applied Isaiah's words to the religious leaders he came into contact with...

You don't have to look to hard to see the very same kind of people today. When we
claim to honor God while our heart is far from Him, our worship means nothing. It is not
enough to act religious. Our actions and attitudes must be sincere. If they are not Jesus
and Isaiah's words also describe us...

It is not enough to study about religion or even to study the Bible. We must respond to 
God Himself...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to be filled with the love of Jesus
so that I may remain faithful in doing Your will...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
