05/19/2010 ~~~food for thought~~~HIS HAND IS STRONG ENOUGH...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you. (I Pet. 5:7)

Our Lesson for Today:
I think it goes without saying that each one of us knows something about anxiety.
Why is this something we all struggle with? ~~~ Because we are all sinners. Born 
with sinful hearts, inherited from sinful parents, so we surely must fear the just
anger of a holy God...

Add to those hearts our many daily sins of thought, word and deed, and see how
the fear of that holy God must increase. Now as if this weren't enough, we also have 
the troubles brought into this world when our first parents sinned...

So who's going to hold us? ~~~ "Jesus," Peter tells us. ~~~ And he tells us why. ~~~
It's because "He cares for us." His powerful hands were once stretched out on the cross
for us. ~~~ Those same hands are now stretched around you and me by One who rose 
from the grave to show that the debt of sin was paid, death was defeated, and heaven opened.

Those same hands will be there to carry every believer when it's time to enter heaven's door.
"He cares for you." Peter says. ~~~ He can hold us in the palm of His hand with no trouble
at all...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, hold me by the hand, and lead me safely home...Amen.

No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
