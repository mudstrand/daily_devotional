05/16/2010 ~~~ food for thought ~~~ THE GIFT ONLY GOD COULD GIVE...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. (I Jn. 5:11)

Our Lesson for Today:
"God has given us eternal life," John writes. Life with God is not something we can earn.
It's not payment for our deeds, or a prize we deserve. Only one word fits ~ gift. Only one
could give this gift ~ God. He looked down on us, born dead in unbelief, bound for eternal
death in hell's dungeon, and had pity on is. With amazing love He prepared for us a life that 
never ends...

This life is in His Son, nowhere else can we find life with God but in His Son. Only God's
Son could fill the cross, feel hell's pangs, fling open death's grave, and make it count for
us. The price for life with God was so steep that only God Himself could handle it...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, thank You for the life that brings me joy
on earth and eternity at Your side...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to The father except through me." - John: 14:6
