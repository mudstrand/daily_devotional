05/22/2010~~~food for thought~~~PRESSING ON TOWARD THE GOAL...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
I'm not saying that I have achieved my goal or that I have already reached perfection!
But I keep working toward that day when I will finally be all that Christ Jesus saved me
for and wants me to be... (Phil. 3:12)

Our Lesson for Today:
Paul had said that his goal was to know Christ, ~ to be like Christ, ~ and to be all Christ
had in mind for him. ~ This goal took all of Paul's energies...

What a wonderful example for us. We should not allow anything to take our eyes off our goal ~ 
that of knowing Christ. With the single-mindedness of an athlete in training, we must lay aside
everything harmful and forsake anything that may distract us from being effective Christians.
What is holding you back???

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, guide me, keep me, accompany me on
the road home to heaven...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
