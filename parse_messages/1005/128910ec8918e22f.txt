05/13/2010~~~food for thought~~~DO YOU HAVE THE KEY???

Our Bible Verse for Today:
These are the words of Him who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. 
What He opens no one can shut, and what He shuts no one can open. (Rev. 3:7)

Our Lesson for Today:
When it comes to heaven's door, Scripture leaves no doubt as to who holds the key.
In fact, He is the key. He and He alone opens the door to heaven... 

On that cross centuries ago, He who is holy and true, He who is the priceless Son of God, 
suffered and died. He didn't deserve to die; we did. He carried our guilt, not His own. He 
who had no sin fully paid the penalty for each of our sins...

Like a key the Savior opened the door of heaven. And it stands open until He closes it.
Be sure to heed the warning in these words. Are you merely standing before the cross 
of Christ or are you kneeling in humble faith beneath it?

May God's grace keep Jesus, the key, in the pocket of your faith always...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, thank You for faith's hand that holds
Jesus as my key to heaven...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
