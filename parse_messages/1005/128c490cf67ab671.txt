05/23/2010~~~food for thought~~~GOD IS OUR STRENGTH AND COURAGE... 

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Let us not neglect our meeting together, as some do, but encourage
and warn each other, especially now that the day of His coming back
again is drawing near...(Heb. 10:25)

Our Lesson for Today:
To neglect Christian meetings is to give up the encouragement and help
of other Christians. Christians should be gathering together to share their 
faith and to strengthen one another in the Lord...

As we get closer to the day when Christ will return, we will face many spiritual 
struggles, and even times of persecution. Anti-Christian forces will grow in 
strength. Difficulties should never be excuses for missing church services.
Rather, as difficulties arise, we should make an even greater effort to be faithful 
in attendance...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me in the difficulties of this life so that
I will remain faithful to you and the gathering of my Christian
friends...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
