05/08/2010 ~~~ food for thought~~~HANG ON !!!

Our Bible Verse for Today:
I am coming quickly. hold on to what you have, so that no one
will take away your crown...(Rev. 3:11)

Our Lesson for Today:
Christians have differing gifts, abilities, experience, and maturity.
God doesn't expect us all to be and act the same, but He does
expect us to "hold on" to what we have, to persevere in using our
resources for Him...

If you are a new believer, and feel your faith and spiritual strength 
are little, use what you have to live for Christ, and God will commend 
you...

If you want to hang on to the crown, you need to hang on to God's Word
through which His Spirit strengthens the grip of faith...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, strengthen my faith through Your Word
so I can stand in heaven's victory circle...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
