05/24/2010~~~food for thought~~~TIME TO MAKE AN HONEST EVALUATION OF OUR LIFE...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
It is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came
into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost of all. (I Tim. 1:15)

Our Lesson for Today:
If I were to write the story of my life, I would have to start as Paul did ~
making a full confession, "I am the worst of sinners." Such a confession 
is not easy to make. How is it that everything else we like to exaggerate,
but our sins we like to shrink?

Other people's sins we can easily spot, but our own somehow escape detection.
But the plain truth remains that we are all sinners. And I'll be the first to confess 
that I don't need a microscope to examine my daily life. Sin's contamination is
clearly visible...

Thank God for the fact that, "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners."
Because of Him God won't write the word lost over my grave, but saved by His 
grace in Christ Jesus. Because of this no more needs to be said in the story of
my life...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, let it be said of me that "Chief of sinners
though I be, Jesus shed His blood of me." Amen...
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
