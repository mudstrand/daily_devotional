05/06/2010~~~food for thought~~~PARDON UNDESERVED...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
The Lord make His face to shine upon you and be
gracious to you... (Num. 6:25)

Our Lesson for Today:
Do we really deserve God's love? ~ Shouldn't God be sending the flashing
look of righteous anger our way with eyes of holy wrath? ~ How come punishment,
well deserved because of our sin, becomes pardon, fully given? ~

It's because of God's Son, the second person of the wonderful Trinity. He
came to earth to fully bear the wrath of God over our sins so we can bask in the 
sunshine of His forgiveness. ~ Because the lightning bolt of God's righteous
anger over our sins struck Jesus, we can see Him looking down on us with His 
marvelous love...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, shine upon me with the pardon purchased
by Your love. I need this sunshine daily... Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to he father except through me." - John: 14:6
