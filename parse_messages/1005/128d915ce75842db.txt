05/27/2010~~~food for thought~~~ARE YOU WILLING TO SUFFER FOR CHRIST?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
For I live in eager expectation and hope that I will never do anything that causes me
shame, but that I will always be bold for Christ, as I have been in the past, and that
my life will always honor Christ, whether I live or die...(Phil. 1:20)

Our Lesson for Today:
To have Christ and to work for Christ ~ that's what life is all about. ~ Right? ~ Of course!

But will everyone nod their heads approvingly if we add that in life believers are called 
upon to suffer for Christ? Paul would...

As of yet in our country there's no danger of losing our heads because of our faith. But our
problem to often is that we hide our heads because of our faith, when all around us people
are foolishly saying that truth is what you want to believe. It takes Christian fortitude to
preach that only what God's Word says is true...

When matters like morals, marriage, and life's meaning flip-flop every other day, it requires
strong faith to stand up for what God has said in His unchanging Word...

Remember Those who rely on God's free grace in Christ Jesus, God's power to take care
of their lives, and God's wisdom to lead correctly will along with Paul, have what it takes to
suffer for Christ...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I am weak, but You are strong, be with me...Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather
The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
