05/15/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE ONLY DETERGENT THAT WORKS...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
And the blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from all sin... (I Jn. 1:7)

Our Lesson for Today:
In our verse, John writes about the dirt of sin, the grime of daily life that is ground into our souls.
He speaks about the mud of sinful birth and sinful life that soils everyone, making us fit only for
hell...

BUT then he also points us to the only detergent that can wash sin's stain completely out of our
souls. That's the precious blood of Jesus, God's Son. His blood doesn't just brush off sin's outward 
stain but removes it completely. It doesn't leave any ugly residue but lifts it out totally...

How is this possible? It is because that blood comes from the veins of Him who is not only man but 
God from all eternity. God who promised forgiveness is faithful. At Calvary's cross we see that He did 
not merely sweep sin under the carpet but demanded full payment from His Son as our substitute...

That Son's suffering and death is the miracle whitener that cleanses even the most corrupt sinner and 
the most crimson stain.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, thank You that I can say, "Grace and life eternal 
in that blood I find; Blest be His compassion, infinitely kind." Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
