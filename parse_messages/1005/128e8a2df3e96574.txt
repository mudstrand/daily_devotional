Our Bible Verses for Today: (Thanks to cousin Donna)
And He [God] has given Him [Jesus] authority to judge mankind
because He is the Son of Man...(Jn. 6:27)
And all who believe this will keep themselves pure, just as Christ is pure...(I Jn. 3:3)

Our Lesson for Today:
Isn't it neat how these two separate texts tie so neatly together?
We need to remember that the Christian life is a process of becoming more and more 
like Christ (Ro. 8:29). BUT this process will not be complete until we see Christ face to
face (I Cor. 13:12)...

Now knowing that this is our ultimate destiny we should be motivated to purify ourselves.
To keep pure means to keep morally straight, free from the corruption of sin...

God also purifies us, but there is an action we must take to remain morally fit.
What is that action??? James 4:8 says: Draw close to God and God will draw close to you...
James gives us five ways to accomplish this:
(1) Humble yourselves before God. (4:7)
(2) Resist the Devil. (4:7)
(3) Lead a pure life. (4:8)
(4) Let there be sorrow and deep grief for your sins. (4:9)
(5) Bow down before the Lord and He will lift you up. (4:10)

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I have sinned against You in thought, word, and deed
all for which I seek Your forgiveness...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
