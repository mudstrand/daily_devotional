05/29/2010~~~food for thought~~~"HE" HAS A GIFT FOR ALL WHO WILL BELIEVE...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Because God's children are human beings - made of flesh and blood - 
Jesus also became flesh and blood by being born in human form. For
only as a human-being could He die, and only by dying could He break 
the power of the Devil, who had the power of death...Heb. 2:14

Our Lesson for Today:
Hallelujah Christ's death and resurrection set us free from the fear of death
because death has been defeated. Every person must die, but death is not 
the end; instead it is the doorway to a new life. All who dread death should have 
the opportunity to know the hope that Christ's victory brings...

Let us not pass up the opportunity to share this truth with those who are close to us...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord open my eyes to the opportunity to share
with others the gift of eternal life...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
