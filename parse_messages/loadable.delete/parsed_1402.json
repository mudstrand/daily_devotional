BUT by the power of His Word and Spirit and by\nfaith,\n\nHe instills in us a new desire-to live more perfectly.\n\nOur Lord Jesus kept the Law perfectly and died on our behalf that we might\nlive \n\nwith Him in His kingdom.\n\nToday's Prayer Suggestion:\n\nO Lord, help me, that by Your grace I might learn Your commandments more \n\ncompletely each and every day. Preserve me I pray, that by Your Holy Spirit\n\nI will never become ungrateful and seek after this world's vanity or other\ngods.\n\nHelp me to cling truly and solely to You, I pray in Jesus Name. Amen. \n\n\n\nPastor Alvin and Marcie Sather\n\n\"I am the way and the truth and the life.\n\nNo one comes to the Father except through me.\" John 14:6",
