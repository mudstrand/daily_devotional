03/10/2011~~~food for thought~~~YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN BY GRACE IN CHRIST.

Our Verse for Today:
"He has saved us and called us to a holy life-not because of anything 
we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace 
was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time," - 2 Timothy 1:9

The Lesson for Today:
"He has called us to a holy life." ~ Though Paul may have been speaking
primarily about the pastoral office that he and Timothy shared, his reference
to "a holy calling" applies to all who live by faith. . .

A Christian's daily work is indeed a holy calling and a priestly work because
of God's gift of faith, "not because of our works." Christian holiness is not 
rooted in what we do, but in God's work for us and through us in Christ.

"Purpose and grace, before the beginning of time." God knew, even before 
creation, that in the fullness of time, He would give His Son to die for us. "Before
we existed, yes, even before the foundation of the world was laid ~ when, of
course, we could do nothing good ~ we were chosen by grace in Christ to
salvation, according to God's purpose. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Thank You Lord Jesus, for Your promise never to leave 
me or forsake me. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
