03/09/2011~~~food for thought~~~OUR COMFORT IN TIMES OF TROUBLE

Our Verses for Today:
"[Praise to the God of All Comfort] Praise be to the God and Father of 
our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, 
who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble 
with the comfort we ourselves receive from God." - 2 Corinthians 1:3-4 

The Lesson for Today:
"Praise to the God of all comfort," Paul begins verse 3 with worship to the God
who brings grace and peace. Yes our Lord is worthy to be praised and worshiped. . .

"Who comforts us," Let us remember that a Christians comfort comes through 
the message of reconciliation with God through the work of Jesus Christ. This 
letter also shows how believers are agents of God's consolation and comfort for 
others (7:5-9). . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, teach us to be open to the challenging experiences that
loving others in Your name brings, so we might trust in You all the more
and rejoice when others come to faith in You because they have known
us as your people. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
