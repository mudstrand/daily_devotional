Verses for Today:
For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways," 
declares the LORD. "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my 
ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts." - Isaiah 55:8-9 

Lesson for Today:
What is being said is that God's ways and thoughts are to vast to measure.
His ways and thoughts are beyond human understanding. . .

Riches ~ Wisdom ~ knowledge ~ ~ ~ Riches, are the wealth of God's 
grace and glory. . . The wisdom of God purposeful actions in history to save ~ 
and His intimate knowledge of us is to deep for human beings to fathom. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, may Your Word continue to accomplish Your purpose among us
and around the world. ~ Teach us to hold Your Word sacred and gladly hear
and learn it. . . Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather
The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
