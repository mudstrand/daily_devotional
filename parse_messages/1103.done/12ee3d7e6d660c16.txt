03/24/2011~~~food for thought~~~A GIFT THAT LASTS FOREVER. . .

The Verse for Today:
"Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, 
having stood the test, that person will receive the crown 
of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him." - James 1:12 

The Lesson Today:
The crown of life is like a victory wreath given to winning athletes (see 1 Cor. 9:25).
God's crown of life is not glory and honor here on earth but the reward of eternal
life ~ living with God forever. . .

The way to be in God's winners' circle is by loving Him and staying faithful even
under pressure.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, deliver me from my struggles, and grant me the gifts
that come from You alone. Thank You for Your Son, Jesus, who 
has given me new life. Lead me in Your wisdom until I am raised
to receive the crown of life. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
