03/06/2011~~~food for thought~~~TREASURE HIS WORD UPON YOUR HEART

Verses for Today:
"These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. 
Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home 
and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you 
get up." - Deuteronomy 6: 6-7 

Lesson for Today:
When you read the words "on your heart" it means you should always 
remember and let them be inwardly treasured. . .

"Teach them diligently" is a reminder that parents are to teach God's 
Word faithfully and repeatedly to their children so that God will continually 
dwell with His people. We are also reminded that we have numerous 
opportunities to talk with our children about what God has done. . .

As Christians, we should take every opportunity to discuss what God has 
done through Christ, no matter where we are or what we are doing. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, we thank You for parents, relatives, friends, 
and pastors who speak Your Word in purity and truth.
Use us now as instruments for the salvation of others. . . Amen.


Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
