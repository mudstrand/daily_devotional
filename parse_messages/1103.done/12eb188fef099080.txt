My Grandfather watched as his friends died in WW I. My Father watched as his friends died in WW II and Korea . I watched as my friends died in Vietnam .. 

None of them died for the Mexican Flag. 

Everyone died for the U.S. flag. 

In Texas , a student raised a Mexican flag on a school flag pole; another student took it down. Guess who was expelled...the kid who took it down. 

Kids in high school in California were sent home this year on Cinco de Mayo because they wore T-shirts with the American flag printed on them. 

Enough is enough. 

The below e-mail message needs to be viewed by every American; and every American needs to stand up for America . 

We've bent over to appease the America-haters long enough. 

I'm taking a stand.

I'm standing up because the hundreds of thousands who died fighting in wars for this country, and for the U.S. flag can't stand up. 

And shame on anyone who tries to make this a racist message. 


Let me make this perfectly clear! 


THIS IS MY COUNTRY! 

And, because I make This statement 


DOES NOT 



Mean I'm against immigration!!! 

YOU ARE WELCOME HERE, IN MY COUNTRY! 

Welcome! To come through legally: 


1. Get a sponsor! 


2. Get a place to lay your head! 


3. Get a job! 


4. Live By OUR Rules! 



5. Pay YOUR Taxes! 


And 


6. Learn the LANGUAGE like immigrants 


have in the past!!! 


AND 


7. Please don't demand that we hand over our lifetime 

savings of Social Security Funds to you. 



If you don't want to forward this for fear of offending someone,


Then YOU'RE PART OF THE PROBLEM! 


When will AMERICANS STOP giving away THEIR RIGHTS???



We've gone so far the other way... 


bent over backwards not to offend anyone. 


But it seems no one cares about the 


AMERICAN CITIZEN


that's being offended! 



WAKE UP America !!! 

If You agree.... Pass this on. 

If You don't agree.. Delete It!!!
