03/07/2011~~~food for thought~~~HE IS WONDERFUL

The Verse for Today:
"[Praise to the LORD] LORD, You are my God; I will exalt You and praise Your name, 
for in perfect faithfulness You have done wonderful things, things planned long ago." - Isaiah 25:1 

The Lesson for Today:
When was the last time [you] gave praise to the Lord in such a way? 
"Lord, You are my God; I will exalt You and praise Your name, 
for in perfect faithfulness You have done wonderful things, things 
planned long ago."

Have You forgotten that our Lord Jesus Christ sits on the throne ~
Do you praise His name for His faithfulness and the wonderful
things He has done?

Let us give praise for He is wonderful!

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, we praise and glorify You for the salvation you have
accomplished for us by Your death on the cross. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
