The Verses for Today:
"A psalm of David. The LORD is my shepherd, I lack nothing. 
He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, 
he refreshes my soul. He guides me along the right paths for his name's sake." - Psalm 23:1-3 

The Lesson for Today:
"Shepherd" As a shepherd cares for all the needs of his flock, God cares for every
human need: physical, emotional, and spiritual.
"Pastures" God provides abundantly and daily.
"Restores" A shepherd protects his sheep and keeps them alive by his care.
The Good Shepherd does even more. ~ He cares for every human need.
Ultimately, Christ alone restore our soul as he sacrificed His life for His sheep.
Shepherd lead sheep along safe paths, to the proper destination.
Jesus Himself is the way, the righteous path (Jn 14:6).

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, open my eyes to see Your blessings.
Open my ears to hear Your voice. Open my heart that I may
love You more. . . Amen
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
