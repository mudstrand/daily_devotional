03/13/2011~~~food for thought~~~WE HAVE BEEN CALLED BY HIS GRACE AND GOODNESS

The Verse for Today:
His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life 
through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. 
"Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, 
so that through them you may participate in the divine nature, having 
escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires." - 2 Peter 1:3-4 

The Lesson for Today:
"His divine power," God the Holy Spirit works through the Word to call us
to faith, giving us the knowledge that results in eternal life and that fosters 
our life in Christ.. . 

"Everything" Not everything we want but everything we need for life and godliness.
Yes we shall have all that God has, for in Him we gain wisdom,, righteousness,
strength, and life. We grasp it with our ears and have it in the Word of God. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, we thank You for granting us all things that pertain
to life and godliness, that by Your grace there will be richly
provided for us, an entrance into Your eternal Kingdom. . . Amen. 

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
