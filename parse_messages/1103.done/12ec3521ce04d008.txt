03/17/2011~~~food for thought~~~CALLED TO BE HIS REPRESENTATIVE

The Verse for Today:
"Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves 
with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience." - Colossians 3:12 

The Lesson for Today:
How would you began the day if you were reminded each morning,
that God has chosen us to be Christ's representative on earth. . .

In light of this truth, Paul challenges us to live lives worthy of the calling 
we have received. Stop for a moment ~ ~ ~ think of the awesome
privilege we have being called Christ's very own. . . 

This includes being humble, gentle, patient, understanding, and peaceful.
Remember ~ if you claim to be a Christian people are watching your life.
Can they see Christ in you? ~ How well are you doing as His representative?

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, though You are exalted at the Fathers right hand,
You still hold us. Keep us in Your love to the end. . .Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
