Verse for Today:
"But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to 
everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this 
with gentleness and respect," - 1 Peter 3:15 

The Lesson for Today:
"In your hearts revere Christ as Lord." A Christian's witness begins with a person's
own faith. ~ We must know what we believe, teach,and confess according to God's 
Word. . .

"Prepare to give an answer." Christians are to be prepared to tell others about this 
truth whenever they have the opportunity. Remember the world is always watching
the Christian's faithful response to adversity, which may cause them to seek the reason 
and so hear the Gospel. . .

When we put our faith into practice, living the love that God gives us in Christ Jesus,
we fulfill our purpose as God's church. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to remain faithful even during times of adversity
so that no one would stumble because of my actions. . .Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
