03/29/2011~~~food for thought~~~WE ARE NOT OUTSIDE THE REACH OF HIS SALVATION

Today's Verse:
"For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, 
the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all people. 
This has now been witnessed to at the proper time." - 1 Timothy 2:5-6 

Today's Lesson:
We human beings are separated from God by sin, and only one person
in the universe is our mediator and can stand between us and God and 
us bring us together again ~ He is Jesus who is both God and man.

Jesus' sacrifice brought new life to all people. ~ ~ ~ By His death, 
He paid our penalty for sin and purchased our freedom. . .

Have you let Him bring you to the Father?
Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, lead us in the roles and responsibilities You have so
lovingly assigned us and to live out our vocations in submissiveness
to You and Your Word. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
