03/14/2011~~~food for thought~~~GOD'S SPIRIT HELPS US IN OUR FRAILTY

The Verse for Today:
"And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, 
who have been called according to his purpose." - Romans 8:28 

The Lesson for Today:
"For the good of those who love God." God works in "everything" not just isolated
incidents for our good. This does not mean that all that happens to us is good. . .

Evil is prevalent in our fallen world, but God is able to turn every circumstance around
for our long range good. We need to note that God is not working to make us happy 
but to fulfill His purpose. We need to realize also that this is not for everyone. . .

It can only be claimed by those who love God and are called by Him, that is those whom 
the Holy Spirit convinces to receive Christ. Such people have a new perspective, a new 
mind-set. They trust in God, not in worldly treasures, their security is in heaven. Not on
earth. . .

Their faith in God does not waver in pain and persecution because they know God is 
with them. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord I pray that Your Spirit would help us
in our frailty, assuring us of Your steadfast love.
never leave us or forsake us. turn our complaints 
into prayers and our condemnation into glory. . .Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
