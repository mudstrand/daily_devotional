VERSE FOR TODAY:

_"The generous prosper and are satisfied; those who refresh _

_others will themselves be refreshed." _(Pro. 11:25)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

God supplies us with more so we can give more. In addition, giving

helps us gain a right perspective of our possessions. We should come

to realize they were never ours to begin with, but they were given to

us BY God to be used to help others. So what do we gain by giving?

Freedom from enslavement to our possessions, the joy of helping

others, AND GOD'S APPROVAL!

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Heavenly Father, I have to confess that I have complained,

about lean times in my life, but when I look at many others, I have

to admit, You have blest me in ways that I have not used wisely.

I ask for Your forgiveness. . . Amen.
