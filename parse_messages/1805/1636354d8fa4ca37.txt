VERSE FOR TODAY:

_"When the wicked die, their hopes all perish, for they rely _

_on their own strength. God recues the godly from danger, _

_but He lets the wicked fall into trouble." _(Pro. 11:7, 8)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

These verses contrast two paths in life but are not intended

to apply universally to all people in all circumstances. God's

people are not excluded from problems or struggles. If a person

follows God's wisdom, however, God can rescue them from

trouble. But a wicked person will fall into his or her own traps.

The good person may suffer, but they can be sure they will

ultimately be rescued from eternal death.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Thank You Lord, for the promise of a better place for those who
follow

You, even though they may go through difficult situations on this
earth.

Amen.
