VERSE FOR TODAY:

_"The Lord will not let the godly starve to death, but He refuses_

_to satisfy the craving of the wicked." _(Pro. 10:3)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

These statements are not intended to apply universally to all people

in every situation. For example, some good people do go hungry.

Rather they are intended to communicate the general truth that the

life of the person who seeks God is better in the long run than the

life of the wicked person---a life that leads to ruin. A proverb like

this assumes a just government that cares for the poor and needy.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the practical wisdom for

godly living at every stage of life, that is found in these proverbs.

Amen.
