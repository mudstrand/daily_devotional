Dear Lord, I thank You for this day. I thank You for my being able to
see and to hear this morning. I'm blessed because You are a forgiving God
and an understanding God. You have done so much for me and You keep on
blessing me. Forgive me this day for everything I have done, said or
thought that was not pleasing to you.
I ask now for Your forgiveness. Please keep me safe from all danger
and harm. Help me to start this day with a new attitude and plenty of
gratitude. Let me make the best of each and every day to clear my mind so
that I can hear from You. Please broaden my mind that I can accept
all things. Let me not whine and whimper over things I have no
control over.
And It's the best response when I'm pushed beyond my limits.
I know that when I can't pray, You listen to my heart. Continue to
use me to do Your will. Continue to bless me that I may be a blessing to
others. Keep me strong that I may help the weak .. Keep me uplifted that I
may have words of encouragement for others. I pray for those that are lost
and can't find their way. I pray for those that are misjudged and
misunderstood. I pray for those who don't know You intimately. I pray for
those that will delete this without sharing it with others. I pray for
those that don't believe.

But I thank you that I believe. I believe that God changes people
and God changes things. I pray for all my sisters and brothers. For each
and every family member in their households. I pray for peace, love and
joy in their homes that they are out of debt and all their needs are met.
I pray that every eye that reads this knows there is no problem,
circumstance, or situation greater than God. Every battle is in Your 
hands
for You to fight. I pray that these words be received into the hearts of
every eye that sees it.
