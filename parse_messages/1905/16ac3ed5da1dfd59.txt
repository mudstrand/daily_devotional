SORRY IF YOU HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED THIS DEVO. THIS COMPUTER IS WANTING
TO DO IT'S OWN THING
VERSE FOR MAY 17:_At the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do
not give up._(Gal. 6:9) READ (Gal. 6:1-10)THOUGHT FOR TODAY:Do you
ever get discouraged by an apparent lack of spiritual growth? Do you
frequently lose your temper or enjoy that spicy bit of gossip youjust
can't resist passing on! ! Do you get up to late to pray and read
yourBible, in spite of resolving to set the alarm earlier. Here is a
suggestion,ask a trusted friend about the areas of your life in which
you want to grow spiritually and have that person pray for you and
encourage you to be accountable. Be patient! ! YOU WILL GROW AS YOU
ALLOW THE HOLY SPIRIT TO WORK IN YOU. _ PASTOR AL_
