We confess God to be\n\nthe maker of heaven and earth, and so is also Creator of each person’s body\nand soul. *But* *there is* *more*. Not only do we belong to God because He\nmade us and the Son of God redeemed us, *but also *because the Holy Spirit\nlives in us to enlighten us with His gifts, sanctify us, and keeps us in\nthe\n\ntrue faith. *So it is important that **we welcome Him through holy living.*\n\n* Pastor Al*\n",

Sin exacts death as the penalty.\nThe next truth is Gospel, God’s grace extending to all. This\ngrace means free, unearned, and unmerited salvation: the\nforgiveness of sins, the promise of eternal life, and\nspiritual newness. Salvation by God’s grace comes to us\nthrough the merits of Christ, who atoned for the sin of the\nworld. The triad of truths “by grace alone,” “for Christ’s\nsake alone,” and “though faith alone” has a fourth dimension\nsola Scriptura.
