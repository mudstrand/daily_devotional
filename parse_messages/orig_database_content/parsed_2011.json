Whereas God stopped Abraham from\n\nsacrificing his son, God did not spare His own Son, Jesus,\n\nfrom dying, on the cross. If Jesus had lived, the rest of\n\nhumankind would have died. God sent His only Son to die\n\nfor us so that we can be spared from the eternal death we\n\ndeserve and instead receive eternal life (Jn. 3:16)\n\n*Did you remember to give thanks, thanks-giving day for*\n\n* this undeserved gift of eternal life?*\n\n* Pastor Sather *\n",
