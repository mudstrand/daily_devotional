    "verse": "As God’s fellow workers we urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain . . . I tell you, now is the time of God’s favor, now is the day of salvation. (2 Corinthians 6:1-2)",
    "reflection": "As far as our salvation is concerned, Christ has completed it. We can-add-nothing. We are fully redeemed by Jesus’ blood shed on the cross. BUT let us not forget there is work for us to do, not to earn salvation but to serve the Lord in whatever situation He places us . . . Our response is to do good works for the glory of God, for the good of our neighbor, and for the joy of knowing that we fulfill a purpose in life. It is always time to spread the glad tidings of salvation in Christ, The apostles faithfully did what Christ commanded they preached His Gospel to the world. We too can praise our Lord by what we say and do. We confess our faith in Him when we share what we have with others. We give our witness by our actions and our words, and by what we leave undone: the works of a sinful world.",
    "prayer": "Let us give thanks to Christ for making us a partner in the spreading of the Gospel.",
