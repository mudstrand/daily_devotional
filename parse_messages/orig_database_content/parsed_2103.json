We\n\ncan sing, “Oh the height of Jesus’ love,\n\nhigher than the heav’ns above, deeper than\n\nthe depth of sea, lasting to eternity!\n\nLove that found me—wonderous thought—found me when I sought Him not.” This\n\ntruth is based on the testimony of one who\n\nwas found by Jesus, although he was not seeking Him. Paul knew firsthand\nthe dimensions of Christ’s love. He wrote\n\nthat we may try to grasp its dimensions,\n\nbut Christ’s love for us is beyond our comprehension. It is a love that\n“surpasses knowledge” (Eph. 3:19). In Christ “We\n\nhave redemption through His blood, the\n\nforgiveness of sins, in accordance with\n\nthe riches of God’s grace. (Eph. 1:7)\n\n*Pastor Sather*\n\n*Give thanks and praise to your Savior for *\n\n*His **boundless love.*\n",
