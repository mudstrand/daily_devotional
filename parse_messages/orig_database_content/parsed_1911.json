    "reflection": "The fish symbol ICHTHYS is an abbreviation confession of\nfaith—shorthand for the Greek Isus Christos Theou Hyios\nSoter: Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior.

Of course we know, fish were used in some of\nHis miracles. As called and commissioned apostles, Peter and\nthe others went into the world as fishers of people to let\ndown the net of the Gospel, and they were effective. “The\ndisciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord\nworked with them and confirmed His Word by the signs that\naccompanied it” (Mark 16:20). The ICHTHYS symbol is a reminder\nthat Jesus Christ is our Savior calling us to be fishers of\npeople and “to give an answer to everyone who asks you to\ngive the reason for the hope you have” (I Peter 3:15).",
    "prayer": "Lord Jesus, You called Your disciples to be fishers of\npeople, drawing many into Your saving grace.

For as members of one body you are all*\n\n*called to live in peace. And always be thankful. *\n\n(Col. 3:15)\n\n*Thoughts for Today:*\n\nGratitude is what always spoils life when it is\n\nleft out. A thankful spirit enables one to praise\n\nGod even when circumstances are difficult.\n\nAlexander Whyte, a Scottish preacher, always\n\nbegan his prayers with an expression of gratitude.\n\nOne cold, miserable day his people wondered\n\nwhat he would say. He prayed, “We thank Thee,\n\nO Lord, that it is not always like this.”\n\n*Yes, we always have something to be thankful for.*\n\n……. *Pastor Al*\n",
