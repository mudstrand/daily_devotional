Don’t let the sin go down while you are*\n\n*still angry. *(Eph. 4:26)\n\n\n\n*Today’s Reflection:*\n\nThe Bible doesn’t tell us we should not feel angry, but it points out that\nit is important to handle our anger properly. If vented thought-lessly,\nanger can hurt others and destroy relationships. If bottled up inside, it\ncan cause us to become bitter and destroy us from within. Paul tells us to\ndeal with our anger immed-iately. If we nurse our anger, we will give\n\nSatin an opportunity to divide us. “*Are you angry **with* *someone right\nnow? What can you do to **resolve* *your differences*?--*Don’t let the day\nend **before* *you begin to work on mend-ing your **differences.*\n\n* Pastor Sather *\n",
