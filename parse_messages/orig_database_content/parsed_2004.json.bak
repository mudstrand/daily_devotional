And wherever He went, He healed the people of every sort of disease and illness.

    "reflection": "Jesus was and is moved by the condition of the people’s lives. He came to be the Shepherd the one who could show people\nhow to avoid life’s pitfalls (see John 10:14). Jesus looked at the crowds following Him and referred them as a field ripe for harvest. Many people are ready to give their lives to Christ if someone would show them how. Jesus commands us to\npray that people will respond to this need for workers. Often, when we pray for something God answers our prayers by\nusing us. Be prepared for God to use you to show another person the way to Him.",
    "prayer": "Loving God, open our eyes to see the harvest of souls around us and stir our hearts to respond to Your call. Use us as Your instruments to guide others to You, showing them the way with compassion and grace. (AI)",

Although our sins deserve severe judgment, God has chosen to show love and mercy to all who seek Him.",
