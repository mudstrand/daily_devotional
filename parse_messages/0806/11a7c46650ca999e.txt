06/12/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ The lessons which are remembered the longest
are those which are taught by example...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul says: "I do not want to seem to be trying to frighten you
with my letters...

For some say, 'His letters are weighty and forceful, but in 
person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing.'

Such people should realize that what we are in our letters when
we are absent, we will be in our actions when we are present...(2 Cor. 10:9-11) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Some were saying that Paul's speaking amounted to nothing.
Greece was known for its eloquent and persuasive orators...

Evidently, some were judging Paul by comparing him to other
speakers they had heard, and perhaps Paul was not the most 
powerful preacher, (but he was an excellent debater).

What we need to remember is that Paul was responding obediently
to God's call and so introduced Christianity to the Roman empire...

If we look to Ex. 4:10-12 and Jer. 1:6 we will see that Moses and 
Jeremiah also had problems speaking...

Preaching ability is not the first prerequisite of a great leader, what
is most important is remaining faithful...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father I thank You for faithful men like Paul.
Because of them we have Your printed Word today. Help
me to stand firm on Your Word...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is our Commander and Chief...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
