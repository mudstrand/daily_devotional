Our Bible Verse for Today:

And now, brothers, we want you to know about the grace
that God has given the Macedonian churches...

Out of the most severe trial, their overflowing joy and their
extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity...

For I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and
even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own,

They urgentlly pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in 
this service to the saints...

And they did not do as we expected, but they gave themselves 
first to the Lord and then to us in keeping with God's will...(2 Cor. 8:1-5) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

During Paul's third missionary journey, he had collected money 
for the impoverished believers in Jerusalem. The churches in
Macedonia ~ Philippi ~ Thessalonica, and Berea had given money 
even though they were poor, and they had given sacrificially more 
than Paul had expected. Although they were poor themselves, 
they wanted to help...

The amount we give is not as important as why and how we give.
God does not want us to give grudgingly. Instead, He wants us to
give as these churches did, out of dedication to Christ ~ love for 
fellow believers ~ the joy of helping those in need ~ as well as the 
fact that it was simply the good and right thing to do...

How well does your giving measure up to the standards set by the 
Macedonian churches?

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Forgive me for looking only at the 
things I do not have, but help me to see all the blessings
I have received. Give me a heart of compassion and a love
to share what I have with those in need...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will help you see what is important...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
