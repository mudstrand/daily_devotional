Our Bible Verses for Today:

Remember this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly,
and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.

Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give,
not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.

And God is able to make all grace abound to you so that in all things 
at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good 
work...(2 Cor. 9:6-8) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

People often hesitate to give generously to God because
they worry about having enough money left over to meet
their own needs...

Paul assured the Corinthians that God was able to meet their
needs...

We need to remember that our attitude is more important
than the amount we give. We don't have to be embarrassed 
if we can give only a small gift...

God is concerned about how we give from the resources we 
have (see Mk. 12:41-44). According to that standard, the
giving of the Macedonian churches would be difficult to match (8:3).

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I find myself falling short in so many areas 
of my life when I consider all that You have done for me...Help me
to be more faithful in my walk with You...Amen.

Keep looking up, He may be speaking to You today...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
