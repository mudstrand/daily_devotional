to be so offensive as the cowardice of not daring to 
admit them...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Paul surely understood human nature, He says:

"For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according
to what one has, not according to what he does not have...

Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard
pressed, but that there might be equality...(2 Cor. 8:12, 13) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul says that we should give of what we have, not what we
don't have. Sacrificial giving must be responsible giving...

Paul wants believers to give generously but not to the extent
that those who depend on the givers (their families for example)
must go without having their basic needs met...

Give until it hurts, but don't give tell it hurts your family and/or
relatives who need your financial support...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, help me to be a more responsible
giver ~ help me to always remember all that I have is a
gift from you, and was not meant to be used only to please
my own comforts...Amen.

Keep looking up, seek His counsel...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
