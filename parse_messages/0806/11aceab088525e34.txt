but their echoes are truly endless...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,

Who gave Himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age,
according to the will of our God and Father,

to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen...(Gal. 1:3-5) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

God's plan all along was to save us by Jesus' death...

We have been rescued from the power of this present world
a world ruled by Satan and full of cruelty, tragedy, temptation, 
and deception...

Being rescued from this evil world doesn't mean that we are 
taken out it but that we are no longer enslaved to it. You were
saved to live for God...

Does your life reflect your gratitude for being rescued? Have
you transformed your loyalty from this world to Christ???

Our Prayer for Today:
I thank You again today for taking my place
upon the cross. I pray that my life reflects my
gratitude for saving my life Amen...

Keep looking up, in gratitude for what Christ 
has done in your life ...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
