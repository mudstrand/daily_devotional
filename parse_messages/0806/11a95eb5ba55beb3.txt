Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul is still speaking about the false preachers that 
the Corinthians were dealing with...

For such men are false apostles. deceitful workmen, 
masquerading as apostles of Christ...

And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as 
an angel of light...

It is not surprising, then, if his servant masquerade as 
servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their 
actions deserve... (2 Cor. 11:13-15) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Satan and his servants can also deceive us by appearing
to be attractive, good, and moral. Many unexacting people
follow smooth-talking... 

Bible quoting leaders into cults that alienate them from their 
families and lead them into the practice of immorality and 
deceit...

Don't be fooled by external appearances. Our impressions 
alone are not an accurate indicator of who is or isn't a true 
follower of Christ...

SO, it helps to ask questions:
(1) Do the teachings confirm Scriptures (Acts 17:11)?
(2) Does the teacher affirm and proclaim that Christ is 
God who came into the world as a man to save people
from their sins(1 Jn 4:1-3)?
(3) Is the teachers life style consistent with biblical morality
(Mt. 12:33-37)?

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray for godly wisdom, so that
I would not be lead astray by the fashionable preachers 
of the day. Help me to examine closely what is being 
preached...Amen.

Keep looking up, true wisdom comes from above...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
