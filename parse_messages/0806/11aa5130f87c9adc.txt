are the rarest things in the world...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

But He said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is made 
perfect in weakness. Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my
weakness, so that Christ's power may rest on me...(2 Cor. 12:9) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul prayed that God would remove his affliction, But God did not do
it because He wanted to demonstrate His power through Paul. The 
fact that God's power is displaced in our weakness should give us
courage and hope...

As we recognize our limitations, we will depend more on God for our
effectiveness rather than on our own energy, effort, or talent...

Our limitations not only help develop Christian character but also deep
our worship, because in admitting them, we affirm God's strength...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your love and mercies
which are new every day. I thank You for my e-mail friends and 
I pray that You would bless them with good health and safety...Amen

Keep looking up, God answers prayer...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
