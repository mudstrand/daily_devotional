they stop asking questions...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of
God's people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks
to God...

Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, men 
will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession
of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them
and with everyone else...

And in their prayers for you their hearts will go out to you, because 
of the surpassing grace God has given you...

Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift...(2 Cor. 9: 12-15) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul emphasizes the spiritual rewards for those who give
generously to God's work. We should never expect to become 
wealthy through giving...

Those who receive your gifts will be helped, will praise God,
and will pray for you...

As you bless others, you will be blessed...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, remind me to share of the many
blessing I have received from You with those who are not
as fortunate as I have been. I pray for good health and safety 
for each person who will read this message...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will help you give...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
