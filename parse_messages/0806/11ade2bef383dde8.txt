07/01/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ The way of the world is the way of perdition...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and 
are trying to pervert the Gospel of Christ...(Gal. 1:7) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

The Bible says there is only one way to be forgiven of sin ~
which is by believing in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior...

No other person or method, or ritual can give eternal life. 

Attempting to be open minded and tolerant, some people 
assert that all religions are equally valid paths to God. In a
free society, people have the right to their opinions, but this 
does not guarantee that their ideas are right...

God does not accept man-made religions as a substitute for
faith in Jesus Christ. He has provided just one way ~ 
Jesus Christ (Jn. 14:6)...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord Jesus, I thank You for the sure way to inherit eternal life.
I pray that One Day soon all will come to know the truth...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is the only Way...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Grand-pa Al & Grand-ma Marcie
