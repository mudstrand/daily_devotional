06/05/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ Your character is built by what you stand for,
your reputation by what you fall for...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul continues: Here is my advise about what is best for you
in this matter: Last year you were the first not only to give but
also to have the desire to do so...

Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may
be matched by your completion of it, according to your means...

For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according 
to what it has, not according to what it does not have...

Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard 
pressed, but that there might be equality...(2 Cor. 8:10-13) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

The Christians in the Corinthian church had money, and apparently
they had planned to collect money for the Jerusalem church a year
earlier (see 2 Cor. 9:2)...

Paul challenges them to act on these plans. We should see that
four principles of giving emerge here:

1) Your willingness to give enthusiastically is more important than
the amount you give;
2) You should strive to fulfil your financial commitments;
3) If you give to others in need, they will, in turn, help you when you are in need;
4) You should give as a response to Christ, not for anything you can get out of it.

How you give reflects your devotion to Christ...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, help me to always be mindful of 
the needs of others. Temper my heart with grace and
mercy, give me a forgiving heart I pray in Jesus name...Amen.

Keep looking up, and your heart will be changed...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
