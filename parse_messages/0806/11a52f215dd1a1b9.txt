Our Bible Verses for Today:

(Paul continues) But just as you excel in everything ~ in faith,
in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in your
love for us ~ see that you also excel in this grace of giving...

I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your 
love by comparing it with the earnestness of others...(2 Cor. 8:7, 8) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

By what Paul writes it would seem that the Corinthian believers
excelled in everything ~ they had faith, gifted speakers, knowledge, 
enthusiasm, and love...

But Paul also wanted them to be leaders in giving. Giving is a natural
response of love. We need to remember that Paul did not order the 
Corinthians to give, but he encouraged them to prove that their love was 
real...

When we truly love someone, we should want to give that person
our time and attention and provide for his or her needs. If we
refuse to help, our love is not as genuine as we say...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for the many blessing I have 
received in my life time. You know that I love You because You
know my heart ~ But those I wish to know my love for them do
not know me as You do~ so please Lord help me to better prove
my love for them...Amen

Keep looking up, love elevates us to a higher calling...
You are in the prayers of two who love you...
