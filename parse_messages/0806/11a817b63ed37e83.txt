06/13/08 ~~~ (Food for thought) ~~~Enthusiasm is contagious, and so is the lack of it...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul says: "Let him who boasts boast in the Lord."

For it is not the one who commends himself who
is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.
(2 Cor. 10:17, 18) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

When we do something well, we want to tell others and
be recognized. But recognition is dangerous ~ it can lead
to inflated pride...

It is so much better to seek the praise of God rather than
the praise of people. Then ~ when we receive praise, we
will be free to give God the credit...

What are some things you should change about the way you 
live in order to receive God's commendation?

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, if I should receive praise, I pray
that I would not become prideful. For I know that all that
I do is possible only through You. So, help me to always 
give You the credit...Amen.

Keep looking up, our strength comes from above...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
