Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul says: "I have made a fool of myself, but you drove me to it.
I ought to have been commended by you, for I am not in the least
inferior to the "super-apostles," even though I am nothing...

The things that mark an apostle ~ signs, wonders and miracles ~
were done among you with great perseverance...(2 Cor. 12:11, 12) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul was not merely revealing his feelings, he was defending his authority 
as an apostle of Jesus Christ. 

Paul had been hurt by the church of Corinth by their doubting and questioning 
him, so he defended himself for the cause of the "Good News." 

When people question you, do you only think of saving your reputation OR
are you more concerned about what people will think about Christ?

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear heavenly Father, I pray that my words and actions would
not be an offense to You. I pray that I would always remember
that as a believer I am representing You...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is the light...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
