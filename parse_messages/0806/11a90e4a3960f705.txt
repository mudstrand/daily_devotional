Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul's says, "I may not be a trained speaker, but I do have knowledge.
We have made this perfectly clear to you in every way...

Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching
the gospel of God to you free of charge...(2 Cor 11:6, 7) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

The Corinthians may have thought that preachers could be judged
by how much money they demanded. A good speaker would charge
a large sum, a fair speaker would be a little cheaper, a poor speaker 
would be free...

The false teacher may have argued that because Paul asked no fee
for his preaching, he must have been an amateur, with little authority
or competence...

Believers today must be careful not to assume that every preacher
or evangelist who is well known or who demands a large honorarium
is superior at teaching God's Word...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for the simple clear 
messages, that are easy to understand. I thank you for
Your Word, for it is a lamp onto my feet and a light onto
my path, for without Your Word each day I would stumble
and fall for may of Satan's knifing ways...Amen.

Keep looking up, His salvation is free...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
