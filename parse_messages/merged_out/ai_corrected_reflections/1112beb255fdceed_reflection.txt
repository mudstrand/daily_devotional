Canceling the first covenant in order to establish a far better one meant doing away with the system of sacrifice contained in the ceremonial law. It didn't mean eliminating God's moral law (the Ten Commandments). The ceremonial law prepared people for Christ's coming. With Christ's death and resurrection, that system was no longer needed. Now, through Christ, we can fulfill the moral law as we allow Him to live in us.
