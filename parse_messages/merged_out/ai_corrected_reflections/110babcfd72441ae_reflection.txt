It is easy to get discouraged, thinking that God has forgotten us. But God is never unjust. He never forgets or overlooks our hard work for Him. Presently, you may not be receiving rewards and acclaim, but God knows your efforts of love and ministry. Let God's love for you and His intimate knowledge of your service for Him bolster you as you face disappointment and rejection here on earth.
