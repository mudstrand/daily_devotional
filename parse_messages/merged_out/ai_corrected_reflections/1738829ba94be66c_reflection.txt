Our joy, prayers, and thankfulness should not fluctuate with our circumstances or feelings. Obeying these three commands—be joyful, keep praying, be thankful—often goes against our natural inclinations. When we make a conscious decision to do what God says, however, we will begin to see it easier to be joyful and thankful. Remember, Paul did not say we are to be thankful for all things, but in all things.
