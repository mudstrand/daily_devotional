Because God was guiding his ministry, Paul wasn't doing anything that God hadn't already planned and given him power to do. Similarly, God appointed Jeremiah to be his spokesman even before Jeremiah was born (Jeremiah 1:5). God knows each one of us intimately as well, and he chose you to be his even before you were born (see Psalm 139). He wants you to draw close to him and fulfill the purpose he has for your life.
