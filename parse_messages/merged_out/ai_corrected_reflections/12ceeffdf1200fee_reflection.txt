God's favor does not automatically bring instant success or fame. Think about what I just said — His blessing on Mary, the honor of being the mother of the Messiah, would lead to much pain: her peers would ridicule her; her fiancé would come close to leaving her; her son would be rejected and murdered. But through her son would come the world's only hope, and this is why Mary has been praised by countless generations. Her submission was part of God's plan to bring our salvation. If sorrow weighs you down and dims your hope, think of Mary and wait patiently for God to finish working out His plan.
