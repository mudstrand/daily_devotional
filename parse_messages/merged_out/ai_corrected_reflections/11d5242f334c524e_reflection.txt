Jews and Gentiles alike could be guilty of spiritual pride — Jews for thinking their faith and traditions elevated them above everyone else. Gentiles for trusting in their achievements, power, or position. Spiritual pride blinds us to our own faults and magnifies the faults of others. Be careful not to become proud of your salvation. Instead, humbly thank God for what He has done, and encourage others who might be struggling in their faith.
