God created us, knows us, and loves us. It only makes sense, then, to listen to His instructions and do what He says. The Bible is His unfailing word to us. It is like an owner's manual for a car. If you obey God's instructions, you will "run right" and find His kind of power to live. If you ignore them, you will have breakdowns, accidents, and failures.
