Christianity is the one true faith because Jesus, the only source of salvation, rescues us from the evil one. He delivers all people from a verdict of damnation and heals ills of body and soul. Christ's name is received only by faith. Therefore, we are saved by confidence in Christ's name, and not by confidence in our works. For "the name" here means the cause that is mentioned, because of which salvation is gained. To call upon Christ's name is to trust in His name as the cause, or price, because of which we are saved.
