Jesus objected when in the temple courtyard merchants sold animals intended for sacrifice and operated currency exchange for profit. He objects today when people turn God's house into a marketplace and transact business. To us, "church" is more than a building. It is God's people, who believe themselves to be redeemed by Jesus Christ, serve Him on Sundays and weekdays and profess Him before the world. Our Lord made it the business of the church to "make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you" (Matthew 28:19-20).
