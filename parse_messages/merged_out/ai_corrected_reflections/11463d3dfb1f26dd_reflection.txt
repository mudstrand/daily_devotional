We now have peace with God, which may be different from peaceful feelings such as calmness. Peace with God means that we have been reconciled with Him. There is no more hostility between us, no sin blocking our relationship with Him. Peace with God is possible only because Jesus paid the price for our sins through His death on the cross.
