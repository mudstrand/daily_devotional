The Jews were proud to be called children of Abraham. Really, Paul uses Abraham as a good example of someone who was saved by faith. (Abraham believed in God.) By emphasizing faith, Paul is not saying that God's law is not important (Romans 4:13), but that it is impossible to be saved simply by obeying it. Let us not look to our good works as a way to inherit eternal life.
