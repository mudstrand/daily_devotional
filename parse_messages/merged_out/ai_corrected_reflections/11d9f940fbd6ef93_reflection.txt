God's grace is beyond any human comprehension. If we were asked to explain it, we could only make a feeble attempt. Oh yes, we may list a number of gifts we have received from Him, but the greatest gift we have been promised is eternal life, by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone. And here is where words alone cannot shed adequate light on the meaning of God's grace, for such undeserving people such as we. Christ, in His crucifixion and resurrection, was victorious over Satan. Through Christ's victory, we have victory.
