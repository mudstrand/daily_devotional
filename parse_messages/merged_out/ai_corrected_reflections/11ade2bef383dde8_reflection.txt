The Bible says there is only one way to be forgiven of sin—which is by believing in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. No other person or method or ritual can give eternal life. Attempting to be open-minded and tolerant, some people assert that all religions are equally valid paths to God. In a free society, people have the right to their opinions, but this does not guarantee that their ideas are right. God does not accept man-made religions as a substitute for faith in Jesus Christ. He has provided just one way—Jesus Christ (John 14:6).
