Security had made David feel invincible. Although he knew his riches and power had come from God, they had gone to his head, making him proud. Wealth, power, and fame usually have an intoxicating effect on people, making them feel self-secure and independent from God. But this false security can be easily shattered. Don't be trapped by the false security of prosperity. Instead, depend on God for your security, and you won't be shaken when worldly possessions disappear.
