The question is: "What is our approach to the throne of grace?" The only way is by "prayer." How? Boldly and with confidence. Some Christians approach God meekly with heads hung low, afraid to ask Him to meet their needs. Others pray flippantly, giving little thought to what they say. What one must do is come with reverence because He is your King. But also come with bold assurance because He is your Friend and Counselor.
