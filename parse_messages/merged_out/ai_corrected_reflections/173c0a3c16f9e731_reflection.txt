How do you react when worry enters your mind? What do you do when you can't seem to ignore or rationalize your fear away? If this happens, take a deep breath and pray. Ask God to fill you with His peace so that you can rest in His presence. Lord, help me grow my faith so that it guards my heart and allows me to manage my emotions. Amen.
