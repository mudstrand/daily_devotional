It takes intense heat to purify gold and silver. Similarly, it takes the heat of trials for the Christian to be purified through trials. By them, God shows us what is in us and clears out anything that gets in the way of complete trust in Him. So when tough times come our way, realize that God wants to use them to refine your faith and purify your heart.
