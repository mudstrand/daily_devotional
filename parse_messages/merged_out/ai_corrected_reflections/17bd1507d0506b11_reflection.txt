We are often confused by the events around us. Some things we will never understand until years later when we look back and see how God was working. This proverb counsels us to not worry if we don't understand everything as it happens; instead, we should trust that God knows what He is doing, even if His timing or design is not clear to us. Read Psalm 37:23 for a reassuring promise of God's direction in our life.
