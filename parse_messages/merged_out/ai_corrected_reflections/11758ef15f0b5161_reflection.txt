Paul was writing to those who were ignoring the church's problems. They didn't realize that allowing open sin to exist in the church affects all the members. Paul does not expect anyone to be sinless - all believers struggle with sin daily. Instead, he is speaking against those who deliberately sin, feel no guilt, and refuse to repent. This kind of sin cannot be tolerated in the church because it affects others. We have a responsibility to other believers. Blatant sins, left uncorrected, confuse and divide the congregation. While believers should encourage, pray for, and build one another up, they must also be intolerant of sin that jeopardizes the spiritual health of the church.
