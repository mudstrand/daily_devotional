David had found the secret to joy. True joy is far deeper than happiness; we can feel joy in spite of our deepest troubles. Happiness is temporary because it is based on external circumstances, but joy is lasting because it is based on God within us. As we consider His daily presence, we will find contentment. As we understand the future He has for us, we will experience joy. Don't base your life on circumstances, but on God.
