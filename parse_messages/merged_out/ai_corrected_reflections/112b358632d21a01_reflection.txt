When people dishonor God, reducing His image to that of man or animals, they sink lower than beasts. They practice iniquity lower than what might be considered that of animals. Not only are the coarse and grossly evil persons guilty of these sins, but learned ones and cultured people also have fallen in similar ways. When such filthy practices make slaves of the educated and the cultured, it is evident that the avenger is near.
