Waiting for God to help us is not easy—but David received four benefits: (1) God lifted him out of despair. (2) God set his feet on solid ground. (3) God steadied him as he walked, and (4) God put a new song of praise in his mouth. Often, blessings cannot be received unless we go through the trial of waiting.
