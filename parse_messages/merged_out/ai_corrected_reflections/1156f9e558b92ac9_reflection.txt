These words were written to a church which would soon undergo terrible persecution. In just a few years, Paul's hypothetical situations would turn into painful realities. But this passage also reaffirms God's profound love for His people. No matter what happens to us, no matter where we are, we can never be separated from His love. Suffering should not drive us away from God but help us to identify with Him and allow His love to heal us.
