When someone claims to have faith, what he or she may have is intellectual assent, agreement with a set of Christian teachings, and as such, it would be incomplete faith. True faith transforms our conduct as well as our thoughts. If our life remains unchanged, we do not truly believe the truths we claim to believe.
