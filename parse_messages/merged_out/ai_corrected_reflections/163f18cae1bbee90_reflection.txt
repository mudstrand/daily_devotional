Let's be honest with ourselves: Why do we save money? Are we saving for retirement? Is it to buy more expensive cars or toys? Is it to be secure? In Luke 12:18ff, Jesus challenges us to think beyond earthbound goals and to use what we have been given for God's Kingdom. Faith, service, and obedience are the way to become rich toward God.
