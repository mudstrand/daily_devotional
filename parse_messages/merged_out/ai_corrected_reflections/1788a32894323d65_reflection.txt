It is a comfort to know as we gather at the Lord's Table that Jesus is there. His promise is: "Surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age" (Matthew 28:20). And "where two or three come together in My name, there I am with them" (Matthew 18:20). In addition, we have His very specific promise that He is with us in a very special way when we attend Holy Communion.
