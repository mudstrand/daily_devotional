"Comfort, comfort My people" is the most appropriate Lenten text. Forgiveness in Christ, the Lamb of God, is the comfort that pastors bring to the ailing and failing members of the church. In this, they have the assistance of elders and deacons in the congregation who pray for the sick (James 5:14-15). And not only they, but all members of the church, bring words of hope and cheer to sorrowful and suffering brothers and sisters in the faith. That is how we can strengthen one another in the communion of saints.
