We are all familiar with the image of the Christian community as the "body of Christ." Yet sometimes it's easy for some to forget that their actions affect the rest of the body. I have been sobered by the realization of how the choices I make can impact beyond myself. That is when I take comfort in remembering that "Christ is the head." Together, as we follow His lead, we can form a body that looks upward in worship and moves outward in service. Ask Jesus for ways to work well with other parts of His body today.
