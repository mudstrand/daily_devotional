Remember, we bring sorrow to the Holy Spirit by the way we live. In verses 28-31, Paul warns us against unwholesome language, bitterness, improper use of anger, harsh words, slander, and bad attitudes toward others. Instead of acting that way, we should be forgiving, just as God has forgiven us. Are you bringing sorrow or pleasing God with your attitudes and actions? Act in love toward your brothers and sisters in Christ. We are called to do that because God acted in love by sending His Son to die for our sins.
