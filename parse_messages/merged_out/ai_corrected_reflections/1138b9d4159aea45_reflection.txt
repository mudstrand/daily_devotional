Luther wrote, "No rock, steel, or diamond could be as hard as the human heart is toward the Word of God." Unless the heart yields to the Spirit of God, there is a judgment in store for the unrepentant sinner. Our Lord stated clearly that on the last day, He shall turn away the unrighteous to eternal fire. But God gives assurance to the righteous that they shall enter and possess the Kingdom prepared for them. According to God's justice, the faithful will be ushered into His blissful Kingdom, and the unrepentant will be thrown into the lake of fire. What we should come to realize is that the atonement of Christ in our behalf was an act fully in accord with divine justice and its requirements. The one whom God has justified is made completely whole in Christ and is entirely free from condemnation.
