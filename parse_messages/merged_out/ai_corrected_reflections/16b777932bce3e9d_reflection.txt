In Psalm 13, David expresses his grief. He addresses God with raw and honest words, "How long, O Lord?" I believe we've all had dark times when we wonder if God has abandoned us. But like David, our aching can give way to joy when we approach God honestly, plead for help, and reaffirm our trust in a God whose love for us will never waver or change. Let us keep these three thoughts in mind: SORROW LOOKS BACK, WORRY LOOKS AROUND, AND FAITH LOOKS UP.
