Apparently, the Corinthians were ready to make wholesale changes without thinking through the consequences. Paul was writing to say that people should be faithful Christians right where they are. You can do God's work and demonstrate your faith anywhere. If you became a Christian after marriage, and your spouse is not a believer, remember you don't have to be married to a Christian to live for Christ. Don't assume that you are in the wrong place or stuck with the wrong person. You may be just where God wants you. (see v. 20)
