Proud people take little account of their weakness and do not anticipate stumbling blocks. They think they are above the frailties of common people. In this state of mind, they are easily tripped up. Ironically, proud people seldom realize that pride is their problem, although everyone around them is well aware of it. Ask someone you trust whether self-satisfaction has blinded you to warning signs. He or she may help you avoid a fall.
