Do your troubles, like "deep waters," threaten to drown you? David, in his weakness and helplessness, knew that God alone had rescued him from his enemies when he was defenseless. When you wish that God would rescue you from your troubles, remember that He can either deliver you or be your support as you go through them. Either way, His protection is best for you. When you feel like you're drowning in your troubles, ask God to help you, hold you steady, and protect you. In His care, you are never helpless.
