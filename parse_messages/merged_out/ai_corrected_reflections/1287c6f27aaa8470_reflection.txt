If you go to Isaiah 29:13, you will see that Isaiah criticized the hypocrites of his day, and Jesus applied Isaiah's words to the religious leaders he came into contact with. You don't have to look too hard to see the very same kind of people today. When we claim to honor God while our heart is far from Him, our worship means nothing. It is not enough to act religious. Our actions and attitudes must be sincere. If they are not, Jesus and Isaiah's words also describe us. It is not enough to study about religion or even to study the Bible. We must respond to God Himself.
