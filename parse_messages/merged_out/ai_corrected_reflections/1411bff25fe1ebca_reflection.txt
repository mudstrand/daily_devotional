"Why do you hide when I need you the most?" To the psalmist, God seemed far away. But even though the writer had honest doubts, he did not stop praying or conclude that God no longer cared. He was not complaining but simply asking God to hurry to his aid. It is during those times when we feel the most alone or oppressed that we need to keep praying, telling God about our troubles.
