Zechariah had just recalled hundreds of years of God's sovereign work in history, beginning with Abraham and going on into eternity. Then, in tender contrast, he personalized the story. His son had been chosen for a key role in the drama of the ages. Although God has unlimited power, He chooses to work through frail humans who begin as helpless babies. Don't minimize what God can do through those who are faithful to Him.
