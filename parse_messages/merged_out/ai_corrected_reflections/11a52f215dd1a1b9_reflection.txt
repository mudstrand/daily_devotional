By what Paul writes, it would seem that the Corinthian believers excelled in everything—they had faith, gifted speakers, knowledge, enthusiasm, and love. But Paul also wanted them to be leaders in giving. Giving is a natural response of love. We need to remember that Paul did not order the Corinthians to give, but he encouraged them to prove that their love was real. When we truly love someone, we should want to give that person our time and attention and provide for his or her needs. If we refuse to help, our love is not as genuine as we say.
