Do you ever get discouraged by an apparent lack of spiritual growth? Do you frequently lose your temper or enjoy that spicy bit of gossip you just can't resist passing on? Do you get up too late to pray and read your Bible, in spite of resolving to set the alarm earlier? Here is a suggestion: ask a trusted friend about the areas of your life in which you want to grow spiritually and have that person pray for you and encourage you to be accountable. Be patient! You will grow as you allow the Holy Spirit to work in you.
