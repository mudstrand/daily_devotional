Jesus knew He would be betrayed by one of His disciples, denied by another, and deserted by all of them for a time. Still, He now showed the disciples the full extent of His love. God also knows us completely, as Jesus knew His disciples (2:24, 25:6:64). He knows the sins we have committed and the ones we will yet commit. Still, He loves us. How do you respond to that kind of love?
