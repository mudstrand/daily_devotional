The Lord describes some people as being like a horse or mule that needs to be controlled by a bit and bridle. Rather than letting God guide them step by step, they stubbornly leave God only one option. If God wants to keep them useful for Him, He must use discipline and punishment. God longs to guide us with love and wisdom rather than punishment. He offers to teach us the best way to go. Accept the advice written in God's Word, and don't let your stubbornness keep you from obeying God's Word.
