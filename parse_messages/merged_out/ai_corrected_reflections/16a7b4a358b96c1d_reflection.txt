All around us are people in need, and sometimes we have to set aside our own feelings and agendas to help them. One way we can do that is to remember how God has comforted us in our trials and troubles "so we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God." How easy it is to be engrossed in our own concerns and forget that someone right next to us might need a prayer, a word of comfort, a hug, or a gift of mercy in Jesus's name. COMFORT RECEIVED SHOULD BE COMFORT GIVEN.
