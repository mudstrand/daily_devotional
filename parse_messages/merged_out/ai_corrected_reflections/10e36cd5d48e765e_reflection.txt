A follower of Christ becomes pure and holy through believing the Word of God (Hebrews 4:12). He or she has already accepted forgiveness through Christ's sacrificial death (Hebrews 4:12). Yes, daily application of God's Word will have a purifying effect on our minds and hearts. Scripture points out sin, it motivates us to confess, it renews our relationship with Christ, and it guides us back to the right path.
