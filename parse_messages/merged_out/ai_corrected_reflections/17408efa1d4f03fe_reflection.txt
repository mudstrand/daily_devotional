Your spiritual growth continues until you enter into eternity. Regardless of your chronological age, your spiritual age depends on your dedication to your faith. And unlike the negative connotation of old age, having an old spiritual age is a precious gift! I say it again, it should be our deepest desire to grow spiritually each and every day.
