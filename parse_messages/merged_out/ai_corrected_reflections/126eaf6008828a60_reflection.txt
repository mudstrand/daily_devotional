All three members of the Trinity are involved in salvation. The Father loved us so much that He sent His Son to bridge the gap between us (John 3:16). The Father and the Son send the Holy Spirit to fill our life with love and enable us to live by His power (Acts 1:8). With all this loving care, how can we do less than serve Him completely?
