In these verses, Solomon summarizes that life involves both risk and opportunity. Because life has no guarantees, we must be prepared. "Give generously," because life has opportunities and we must seize them. Solomon does not support a stingy, despairing attitude. Just because life is uncertain does not mean we should do nothing. We need a spirit of trust and adventure, facing life's risks and opportunities with God-directed enthusiasm and faith. Waiting for perfect conditions will mean inactivity.
