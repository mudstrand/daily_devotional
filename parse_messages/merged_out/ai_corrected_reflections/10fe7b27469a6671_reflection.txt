We who have been set apart for God's service, cleansed and made holy (sanctified) by Jesus, now have the same Father as Jesus has, so He has made us His brothers and sisters. Various psalms look forward to Christ and His work in the world. Here the writer has quoted a portion of Psalm 22, a messianic psalm. Because God has adopted all believers as His children, Jesus calls them His brothers and sisters.
