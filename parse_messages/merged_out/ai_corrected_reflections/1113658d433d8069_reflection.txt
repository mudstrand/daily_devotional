We have been made perfect, yet we are being made holy. Through His death and resurrection, Christ, once for all, made His believers perfect in God's sight. At the same time, He is making them holy (progressively cleansed and set apart, for His special use) in their daily pilgrimage here. We should not be surprised, ashamed, or shocked that we still need to grow. God is not finished with us. We can encourage this growth process by deliberately applying Scripture to all areas of our life, by accepting the discipline and guidance Christ provides, and by giving Him control of our desires and goals.
