As followers of Christ, we must give Him our total allegiance. We cannot, as Paul explains, have a part in "the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons." Eating at the Lord's table means communing with Christ and identifying with His death. Drinking from the cup of demons means identifying with Satan by worshiping or promoting pagan (or evil) activities. Are you leading two lives, trying to follow both Christ and the crowd? The Bible tells us we cannot do both at the same time.
