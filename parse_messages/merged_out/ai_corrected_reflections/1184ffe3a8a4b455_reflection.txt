CORRECTIONS_NEEDED the phrase 'the head of the woman is man' does not indicate man's control or supremacy, but rather his being her source. Because of the fact that man was created first, the woman derives her existence from man, as man does from Christ and Christ from God. I would have to say, the principal behind Paul's words is submission, which is a key element in the smooth functioning of any business, government, or family. Why does there have to be submission? I believe God ordained submission in certain relationships to prevent chaos. But it is also important to understand that submission is not surrender, withdrawal, or apathy. It does not mean inferiority ~ because God created all people in His image and all have equal value. 'Submission' is 'mutual commitment' and 'cooperation.'
