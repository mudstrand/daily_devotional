"God's deep secrets" refers to God's unfathomable nature and His whole wonderful plan—Jesus' death and resurrection—and the promise of salvation, which is revealed only to those who believe that what God says is true. Those who believe in Christ's death and resurrection and put their faith in Him will know all they need to know to be saved. This knowledge, however, can't be grasped by even the wisest people unless they accept God's message. All who reject God's message are foolish, no matter how wise the world thinks they are.
