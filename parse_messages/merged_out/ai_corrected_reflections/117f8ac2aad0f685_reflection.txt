Paul gives several important principles for ministering or witnessing. (1) Find common ground with those you contact. (2) Avoid a know-it-all attitude. (3) Make others feel acceptable. (4) Be sensitive to their needs and concerns. (5) Look for opportunities to tell them about Christ. These principles are just as valid for us today as they were for Paul in his day.
