Some think they don't have to worry about sin because: (1) It's God's job to forgive; (2) God is so loving He won't judge us; (3) Sin is not so bad — it teaches us valuable lessons; or (4) We need to stay in touch with the culture around us. Oh, how easy it is for some to take God's grace for granted. But God cannot overlook sin. No matter how many excuses they make, sinners will have to answer to God for their sin.
