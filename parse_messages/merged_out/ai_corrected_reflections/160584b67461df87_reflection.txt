It is an awesome privilege to be able to approach God with freedom and confidence. It goes without saying that most of us would be apprehensive in the presence of a powerful ruler. But thanks to Christ, by faith we can enter directly into God's presence through prayer. We know we will be welcomed with open arms because we are God's children through our union with Christ. Don't be afraid of God; talk to Him about everything.
