Like Ruth, we are foreigners far from God. We may wonder why God would choose to love us when we are so undeserving. The answer is not in us, but in Him. God showed His great love for us when He sent His Son to die for us while we were still sinners. (Romans 5:8) Yes, Christ has become our redeemer. When we come to Him in salvation, we are under His protective wings. GRATEFULNESS IS THE HEART'S RESPONSE IN GOD'S UNDESERVED LOVE.
