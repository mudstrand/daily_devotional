Paul wrote of working harder than the other apostles. This was not an arrogant boast, because he knew that his power came from God and that it didn't really matter who worked hardest. Because of his prominent position as a Pharisee, Paul's conversion made him the object of even greater persecution than the other apostles; thus, he had to work harder to preach the same message. Lord, help me to embrace the grace You offer.
