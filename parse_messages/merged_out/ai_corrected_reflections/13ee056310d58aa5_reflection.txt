Isaiah tells us to call on the Lord while he is near. God is not planning to move away from us, but we often move far from Him or erect barriers of sin between us. Don't wait until you have drifted far away from God to seek Him. Turning to Him may be far more difficult later in life. Or God may come to judge the earth before you decide to turn to Him. Seek God now, while you can, before it is too late.
