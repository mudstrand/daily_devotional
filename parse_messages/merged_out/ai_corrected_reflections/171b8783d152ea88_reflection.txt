Our oneness in Christ does not destroy our individuality. The Holy Spirit has given each Christian special gifts for building up the church. Now that we have these gifts, it is crucial to use them. Are you spiritually mature, exercising the gifts God has given you? If you know what your gifts are, look for opportunities to serve. If you do not know, ask God to show you; perhaps with the help of your minister or Christian friends, you will recognize your special area of service. Use your gifts to strengthen and encourage the church.
