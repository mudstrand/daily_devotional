Remember this—words are powerful, and how you use them reflects on your relationship with God. There possibly isn't anything that identifies Christians as their ability to control their speech, speaking the truth, refusing to slander, and keeping oaths (promises). Always watch what you say. (See what James 3:1-13 says about the importance of controlling the tongue.)
