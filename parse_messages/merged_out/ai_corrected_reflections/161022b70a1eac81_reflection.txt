Submitting to another person is often a misunderstood concept. It does not mean becoming a doormat. Christ, at whose name "every knee will bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth" (Philippians 2:10), submitted His will to the Father, and we honor Christ by following His example. When we submit to God, we become more willing to obey His command to submit to others.
