Because God was guiding Paul's ministry, Paul wasn't doing anything that God hadn't already planned and given him power to do. Similarly, God appointed Jeremiah to be His spokesman before Jeremiah was born (Jeremiah 1:5). God knows each of us intimately as well, and He chose each of us to be His before we were born (see Psalm 139). He wants us to draw close to Him and to fulfill the purpose He has for our lives.
