Jesus himself said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me." (John 14:6) Jesus offers the only safe and secure entry into His kingdom, where there is righteousness, peace, and true happiness. The password has been revealed. Jesus is the password to the kingdom.
