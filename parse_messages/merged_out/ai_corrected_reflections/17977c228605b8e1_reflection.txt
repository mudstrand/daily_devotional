Only God in His mercy can forgive our sins. We need to remember that we cannot earn forgiveness simply by forgiving others. But when we withhold forgiveness from others after having received it ourselves, we show that we do not understand or appreciate God's mercy toward us. (See Matthew 6:14-15 and Ephesians 4:31-32)
