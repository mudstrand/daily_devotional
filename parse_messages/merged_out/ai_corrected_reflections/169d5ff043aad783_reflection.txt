Jesus's kingdom, of course, is "not of the world" (John 18:36). The crowd mistakenly thought "King" Jesus would give them full stomachs and natural freedom. But Jesus counseled them, and us: "Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life" (v. 27). Christ is the bread of eternal life.
