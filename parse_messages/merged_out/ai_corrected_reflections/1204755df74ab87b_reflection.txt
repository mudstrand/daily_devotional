For fellowship with God, His Word and prayer are indispensable. In His Word, He speaks to us. In prayer, we speak to Him. The Word teaches us to know the God to whom we pray. It teaches us how He would have us pray. It gives us precious promises to encourage us in prayer. It often gives us wonderful answers to prayer. The Word comes from God's heart and brings His thoughts and His love into our heart. And then the Word goes back from our heart into His great heart of love. Yes, prayer is the means of fellowship between God's heart and ours.
