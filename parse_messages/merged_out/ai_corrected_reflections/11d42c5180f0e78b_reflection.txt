Because of Christ's resurrection, we know that our body will also be raised from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:20-23) and that we will be given the power to live as Christians now (Ephesians 1:19-20). These ideas are combined in Paul's image of sitting with Christ in the "heavenly realm." Our eternal life with Christ is certain because we are united in His powerful victory. This all came into being because of His great love for us.
