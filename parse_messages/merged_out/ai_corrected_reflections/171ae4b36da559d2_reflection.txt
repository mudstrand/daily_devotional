Let us remember to ask Jesus to help us remain present in His love. We should want to be aware of all that Jesus brings to our life each day. When we are aware of His presence, we can experience abundant joy and enjoy all the beauty of life, no matter how big or small. My desire is to be fully present, basking in the pleasures of Jesus as He guides me in life. Today, take some time to appreciate all your surroundings.
