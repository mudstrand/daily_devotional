The question has been asked by many, "How can we pray at all times?" One way is to pray quick, habitual prayers in response to every situation you meet throughout the day. Another way is to order your life around God's desire and teachings so that your very life becomes a prayer. We should pray for all believers in Christ; so pray for the Christians you know and for the churches around the world.
