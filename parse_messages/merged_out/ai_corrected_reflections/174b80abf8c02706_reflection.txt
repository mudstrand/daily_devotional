God tested Abraham, not to trip him up and watch him fall, but to deepen his capacity to obey God and thus to develop his character. Just as fire refines ore to extract precious metals. I believe you will agree that God has refined us a time or two through difficult circumstances. When we are tested, we can complain, or we can try to see how God is stretching us, to develop our character. Obeying God is often a struggle because it may mean giving up something we truly want. We should not expect our obedience to God to be easy or to come naturally.
