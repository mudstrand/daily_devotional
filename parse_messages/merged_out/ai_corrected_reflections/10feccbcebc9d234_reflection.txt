Jesus had to become human so that He could die and rise again, in order to destroy the Devil's power over death. (see Romans 6:5-11) Only then could Christ deliver those who had lived in constant fear of death and free them to live for Him. Christ's death and resurrection have set us free from the fear of death because death has been defeated. When we belong to God, we need not fear death, because we know that death is only the doorway into eternal life. (see 1 Corinthians 15) Those who fear death should have the opportunity to know the hope that Christ's victory brings. Begin to seek ways to share the truth with those close to you.
