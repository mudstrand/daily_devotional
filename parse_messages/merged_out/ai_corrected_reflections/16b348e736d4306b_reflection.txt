People who believe in the saving power of Jesus' death and resurrection will be with Him forever. It has been said, "All's well that ends up in heaven." Whether we live or die, we win. "For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain." (Philippians 1:21) BELIEF IN JESUS'S DEATH AND RESURRECTION BRINGS THE ASSURANCE OF LIFE WITH HIM FOREVER.
