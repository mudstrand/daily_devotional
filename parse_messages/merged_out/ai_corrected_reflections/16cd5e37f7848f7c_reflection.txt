In this chapter, the Psalmist writes that a good family life is a reward for following God. The values outlined in God's Word include love, service, honesty, integrity, and prayer. These help all relationships, and they are especially vital to the home life. Is your home life heavenly or hectic? Reading and obeying God's Word is a good place to start to make your family all that it should be. God will reward your devotion to Him with inner peace.
