Why should Paul's suffering make the Ephesians feel honored and encouraged? If Paul had not preached the Good News, he would not be in jail, but then the Ephesians would not have heard the message and been converted either. Just as a mother endures the pain of childbirth in order to bring new life into the world, Paul endured the pain of persecution in order to bring new life to the believers in Christ. Obeying Christ is never easy. He calls us to take our cross and follow Him (Matthew 16:24) - that is to be willing to endure pain so that God's message of salvation can reach the entire world. We should feel honored that others have suffered and sacrificed so that we might reap the benefit.
