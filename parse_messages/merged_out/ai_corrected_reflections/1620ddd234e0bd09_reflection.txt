A proverb is a short, wise, easy-to-remember saying that calls a person to action. It doesn't argue about basic spiritual and moral beliefs; it assumes we already know them. The Book of Proverbs focuses on God, His character, works, and blessings, and it tells how we can live in closer relationship to Him.
