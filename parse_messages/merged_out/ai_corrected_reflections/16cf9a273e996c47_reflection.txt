Sometimes we don't let people get to know us completely because we are afraid they will discover something about us that they won't like. But God already knows everything about us, even to the number of hairs on our head (Matthew 10:30), and still He accepts and loves us. God is with us through every situation, in every trial—protecting, loving, and guiding. He knows and loves us completely.
