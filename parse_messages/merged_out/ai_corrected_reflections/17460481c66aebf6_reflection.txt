Even though the Holy Spirit had come, the believers were not immune to Satan's temptations. Although Satan was defeated by Christ at the cross, he was actively trying to make believers stumble—just as he is still at it today (Ephesians 6:12; 1 Peter 5:8). Thank the Lord, Satan's overthrow is inevitable, but it will not occur until the last days, when Jesus returns to judge the world (Revelation 20:10).
