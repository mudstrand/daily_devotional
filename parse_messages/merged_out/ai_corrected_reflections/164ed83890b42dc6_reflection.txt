For centuries, people sought a fountain of youth, a spring that promised to give eternal life and vitality. It was never found. But God's wisdom is a life-giving fountain that can make a person happy, healthy, and alive forever. How? When we live by God's Word, He washes away the deadly effects of sin (see Titus 3:4-8). Here we see the hope of eternal life with Him that gives us a joyful perspective on our present life.
