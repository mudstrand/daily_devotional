During a time of great evil and injustice (sounds a little like now, doesn't it?), David was grateful that God is just and fair. I imagine we have all wondered how many honest people there are left in the world, but we can be assured and thankful that God will continue to bring justice and fairness when we involve Him in our activities. If you ever feel you are being treated unfairly, ask the One who is always fair and just to be with you. Then thank Him for His presence. (Read Isaiah 42:1-6)
