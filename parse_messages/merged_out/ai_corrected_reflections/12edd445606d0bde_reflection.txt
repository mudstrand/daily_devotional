It goes without saying that there are people who trust in other people, are unfruitful. In contrast, those who trust in the Lord flourish like trees planted along a riverbank. Those who trust in the Lord will have abundant strength, not only for their own needs, but even for the needs of others. Are you satisfied with being unfruitful, or do you, like a well-watered tree, have strength in times of crisis and even some to share as you bear fruit for the Lord.
