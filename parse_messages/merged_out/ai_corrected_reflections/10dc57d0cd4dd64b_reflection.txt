Jesus commands us to love each other as He has, and He loved us so much that He gave His life for us. We may not have to die for someone, but there are other ways to practice sacrificial love: like listening, helping, encouraging, and giving. Think of someone in particular who needs this kind of love today. Give all the love you can, and then try to give a little more.
