We've probably all discovered the fact that God does not always preserve believers from difficult circumstances. But He examines (or tests) both the righteous and the wicked. For some, God's tests become a refining fire, while for others, the tests become an incinerator for destruction. Don't ignore or defy the tests and challenges that come your way—use them as opportunities to grow. God is still in control.
