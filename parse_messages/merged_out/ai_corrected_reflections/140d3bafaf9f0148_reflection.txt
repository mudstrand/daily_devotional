When we express our praises to God, we are showing our appreciation and understanding of His worth. It is saying "thank you" for each of the aspects of His divine nature. In doing so, our inward attitude becomes an outward expression. When we praise God, we help ourselves by expanding our awareness of who He is. To further this awareness, in each psalm you read, look for an attribute or characteristic of God for which you can thank Him.
