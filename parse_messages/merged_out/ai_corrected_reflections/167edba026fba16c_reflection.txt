The Bible is not a collection of fables or human ideas about God. It is God's very words given through people to people. Peter emphasized his authority as an eyewitness as well as the God-inspired authority of Scripture to prepare the way for his harsh words against false teachers. Our faith must go beyond what we believe; it must become a part of all we do.
