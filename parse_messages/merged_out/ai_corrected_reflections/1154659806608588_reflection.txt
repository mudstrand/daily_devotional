Paul uses adoption to illustrate the believers' "new" relationship with God. In the Roman culture, the adopted person lost all rights to his old family and gained all the rights of a legitimate child in his new family. He became a full heir to his new father's estate. It is the same for a new believer; he or she gains all the privileges and responsibilities of a child in God's family. One of these outstanding privileges is being led by the Spirit (see Galatians 4:5, 6). We may not always feel like we belong to God, but the Holy Spirit is our witness. His inward presence reminds us of who we are and encourages us with God's love (Romans 5:5).
