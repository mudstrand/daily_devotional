When someone gives you a gift, do you say, "That's very nice—now how much do I owe you?" No, the appropriate response to a gift is, "Thank you!" Yet how often Christians, even after they have been given the gift of salvation, feel obligated to try and work their way to God. Because our salvation and even our faith are gifts, we should respond with gratitude, praise, and joy.
