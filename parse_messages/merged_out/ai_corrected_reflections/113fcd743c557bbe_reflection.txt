The Apostle Paul says that the law proves man cannot become righteous by his own works, but that he is guilty before God. Those who think otherwise are silenced by words such as these. The real purpose of God's law is to convince people of their need and to be convicted before its holy standard. God has not intended that fallen mankind should be able to stand the test of righteousness prescribed in the law.
