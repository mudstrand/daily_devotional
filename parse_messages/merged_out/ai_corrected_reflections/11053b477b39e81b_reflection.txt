God had given the Israelites the opportunity to enter Canaan, but they disobeyed and failed to enter (Numbers 13, 14). Now God offers us the opportunity to enter His ultimate place of rest. He invites us to come to Christ. To enter His rest, you must believe that God has this relationship in mind for you; you must stop trying to create it; you must trust in Christ for it; and you must determine to obey Him. Today is the best time to find peace with God. Tomorrow may be too late.
