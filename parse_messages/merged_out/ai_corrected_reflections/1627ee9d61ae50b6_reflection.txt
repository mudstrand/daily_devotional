HOW DO I KNOW THAT CHRIST HAS RISEN? What proof have I to give? He touched my life one blessed day, and I begin to live! How do I know He left the tomb that morning long ago? I met Him just this morning, and my heart is still aglow! How do I know endless life He gained for me that day? His life within is proof enough of immortality! How do I know that Christ still lives, rich blessings to impart? He walks with me along the way and lives within my heart! Have a blessed Easter!
