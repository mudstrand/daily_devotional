Adoration, when it has entered God's presence and had fellowship with Him, will ever lead to the praise of His name. We should let praise be a part of the incense we bring before God in our quiet time. In the Psalms, we see what a large place praise ought to have in the spiritual life. There are more than sixty Psalms of praise, becoming more frequent as the book draws to its close. We should study the Psalms more closely until our whole heart and life are one continual song of praise.
