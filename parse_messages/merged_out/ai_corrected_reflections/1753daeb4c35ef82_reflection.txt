Love is the greatest of human qualities, and it is an attribute of God Himself (1 John 4:8). Love involves unselfish service to others; to show it gives evidence that you care. Faith is the foundation and cement of God's message; Hope is the attitude and focus. Love is the action. When faith and hope are in line, you are free to love completely because you understand how God loves.
