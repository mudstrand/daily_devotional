What Paul is doing here is distinguishing between freedom to sin and the freedom to serve. Freedom or license to sin is no freedom at all, because it enslaves us to Satan, others, or our own sinful nature. Christians, by contrast, should not be slaves to sin, because they are free to do right and glorify God through loving service to others.
