The only way to become truly wise is to fear (revere) God. This same thought is expressed in (Proverbs 1:7-9). Too often, people want to skip this step, thinking they can become wise by life experiences and academic knowledge alone. But if we do not acknowledge God as the source of wisdom, then our foundation of making wise decisions is shaky, and we are prone to mistakes and foolish choices.
