Trying to protect Jesus, Peter pulled a sword and wounded the high priest's servant. But Jesus told Peter to put away his sword and allow God's plan to unfold. At times it is tempting to take matters into our own hands, to force the issue. Most often, such moves lead to sin. Instead, we must trust God to work out His plan. Think about it, if Peter had his way, Jesus would not have gone to the cross, and God's plan of redemption would have been thwarted.
