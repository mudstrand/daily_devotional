From His throne in heaven, He came to a manger in Bethlehem; From the manger in Bethlehem, He became a carpenter's son; From a carpenter's son, He became a traveling missionary; From a traveling missionary, He became a sacrifice for our sins; From His death on the cross, He was taken to a borrowed tomb; From the tomb He rose again, that we may have eternal life. HALLELUJAH, WHAT A SAVIOR!!!
