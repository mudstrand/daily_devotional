As we know, Ash Wednesday ushers in Lent—a time of reflection, self-sacrifice, spiritual discipline, and fasting to prepare our hearts for Easter. Ash Wednesday reminds us of our mortality (ashes to ashes, dust to dust) and our sinfulness, but also that our mortality and sin have been conquered through the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. Our humanity and our sinfulness have been conquered in Jesus, and we are free.
