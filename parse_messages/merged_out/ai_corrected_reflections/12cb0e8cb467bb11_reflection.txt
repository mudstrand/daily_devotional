We eat bread to satisfy our physical hunger and to sustain physical life. We can satisfy our spiritual life only by a right relationship with Jesus Christ. No wonder He called Himself the bread of life. But bread must be eaten to sustain life, and Christ must be invited into our daily walk to sustain spiritual life. Those who put their faith in Christ will be resurrected from physical death to eternal life with God when Christ comes again. (1 Corinthians 15:52) (1 Thessalonians 4:16)
