Searched me and known me! What this is saying is that God is omniscient. He knows everything about us. This includes knowing our every action, our every thought, even our future, even our very future, with perfect intimacy. Like the Psalmist, we should ask God to extend His omniscience to our inner life, to search out the traces of sin in our lives, so that God's presence might lead us to everlasting life.
