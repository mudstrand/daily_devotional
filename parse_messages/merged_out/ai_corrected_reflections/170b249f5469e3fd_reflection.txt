Like the Pharisee, we can be influenced by mixed emotions in our daily lives: pride, fear, winning the praise of people, or a desire to control. We can often do the right things for the wrong reasons. Jesus challenges us to go deeper. To make choices motivated by trust and love. At times, He will encourage us to step forward boldly. Other times, He will call us to step back and rest. Both actions require trust and an honest evaluation of ourselves.
