Because God will examine what kind of workers we have been for Him, we should build our life on His Word and build His Word into our life. It alone tells us how we are to live for Him and serve Him. Believers who ignore the Bible will certainly be ashamed at the judgment. Consistent and diligent study of God's Word is vital; otherwise, we will be lured into neglecting God and our true purpose for living.
