When Jesus came to this world, John the Baptist called Him "the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world." (John 1:29). We need our sins taken care of because it separates us from God, whose character and ways are always perfect and right. Being right with God is a gift from Him. Jesus, the Lamb, is God's way to cover us. THE ONLY PERMANENT COVERING FOR SIN IS THE BLOOD OF CHRIST.
