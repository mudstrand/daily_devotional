As we think about this letter of Paul's, we see a quite different greeting than what we use in our letters today. But what a wonderful greeting it would be to be reminded of God's wonderful grace. Grace is God's free gift of salvation given to us in Christ. Receiving it brings us peace (Romans 5:1). In a world of noise, confusion, and continuous pressure, people long for peace. Many give up the search, thinking it is impossible to find, but true peace of heart and mind is available to us through faith in Jesus Christ.
