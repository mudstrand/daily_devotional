Because we are united with Christ in His death, our evil desires and bondage to sin died with Him. Now united by faith with Him in His resurrection life, we have an unbroken fellowship with God and freedom from sin's hold on us. For more information on the difference between our new life in Christ and our old sinful nature, read Ephesians 4:21-24 and Colossians 3:3-15.
