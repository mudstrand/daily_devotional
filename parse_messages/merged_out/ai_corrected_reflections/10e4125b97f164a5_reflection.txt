The unity that Jesus is praying for is not organizational unity but spiritual unity. His prayer is for all those who will follow Him, including you and others you know. He also prayed for unity in (17:11), protection from the evil one (17:15), and holiness (17:17). Knowing that Jesus prayed for us should give us confidence as we work for the Kingdom.
