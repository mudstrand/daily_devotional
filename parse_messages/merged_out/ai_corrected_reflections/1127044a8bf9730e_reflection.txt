We can rejoice, knowing that people are seeking Christ, even though they are not free from faults. Children within a home are heirs at their birth. They are given parental love, though there are differences in their ages, development, and personality. This is also true of the family of God. We are all beloved of God through Jesus Christ, the Savior.
