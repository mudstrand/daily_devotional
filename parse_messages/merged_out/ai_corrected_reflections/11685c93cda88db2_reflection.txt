We try to stay clear of actions forbidden by the Scripture, of course, but sometimes Scripture is silent. That is when we need to follow our conscience. "If you do anything you believe is not right, you are sinning" means that to go against conviction will leave a person with a guilty or uneasy conscience. When God shows that something is wrong for us, we should avoid it. But we should not look down on other Christians who exercise their freedom in those areas.
