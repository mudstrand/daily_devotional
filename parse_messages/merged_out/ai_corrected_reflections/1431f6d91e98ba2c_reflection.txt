This is not an ironclad guarantee that all believers will be delivered from death and starvation. Thousands of Christians have been beaten to death, whipped, fed to lions, or executed. God can (and often does) miraculously deliver His followers from pain and death. But sometimes, for purposes known only to Him, He chooses not to. When faced with these harsh realities, we must focus on the wise judgments of God. In times of crises, we can still place our hope in God.
