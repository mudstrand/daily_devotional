We all face problems that can threaten to confuse and disorient us. It may be a call from the doctor's office, a friend who has betrayed you, or a shattered dream. Those are the times to be especially careful. When you are blinded by life's disappointments, don't trust your own instincts. Go to your Bible and trust God to guide you. God promises, "I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go" (Psalm 32:8).
