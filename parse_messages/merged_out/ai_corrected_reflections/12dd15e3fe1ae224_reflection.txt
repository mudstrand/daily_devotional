"God is spirit." The fact that God's essential nature is spiritual, not material, reinforces the teaching that people should worship "with the inclinations of the heart and by faith." Both the Father is spirit and the Son is spirit, and the Father is holy and the Son is holy. The Holy Spirit is referred both to the Father and to the Son, because the Holy Spirit is the Spirit both of the Father and the Son.
