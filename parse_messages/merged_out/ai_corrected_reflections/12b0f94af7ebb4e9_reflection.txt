The Corinthians' pure and simple devotion to Christ was being threatened by false teaching. Paul did not want the believers to lose their simple-minded love for Christ. Keeping Christ first in our life can be very difficult when we have so many distractions threatening to sidetrack our faith. Just as Eve lost her focus by listening to the serpent, we, too, can lose our focus by letting our life become overcrowded and confused. Is there anything that weakens your commitment to keep Christ first in your life? Let us minimize any and all distractions that threaten our devotion to Christ.
