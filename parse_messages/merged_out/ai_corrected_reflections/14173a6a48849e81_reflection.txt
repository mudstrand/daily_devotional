God was against the Jews charging interest or making a profit on loans to the needy (Exodus 22:25; Leviticus 25:35-37), but charging interest on loans to foreigners was allowed (Deuteronomy 23:20). Some people are so obsessed with money that they will change their God-given standards and lifestyle to get it. If money has a controlling force in your life, it must be curbed, or it will harm others and destroy your relationship with God.
