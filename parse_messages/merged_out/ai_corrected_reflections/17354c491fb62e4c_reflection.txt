Jesus didn't come to earth, suffer, and die so that we can merely exist; He came for us to live more abundantly. The best way to live well is to honor and obey Jesus' Word. Then life will overflow with things that satisfy the soul. And if that is the case, we will also laugh often and love much. Ask Jesus to show you any habits, attitudes, or behaviors that hold you back from living the full life He wants you to enjoy.
