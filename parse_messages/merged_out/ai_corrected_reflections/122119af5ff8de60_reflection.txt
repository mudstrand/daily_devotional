As a brilliant scholar, Paul could have overwhelmed his listeners with intellectual arguments. But instead, he shared the simple message of Jesus Christ. Instead of using his scholarly wisdom, he allowed the Holy Spirit to guide his words. In sharing the Good News with others, we should follow Paul's example and keep our message simple and basic. The Holy Spirit will give power to our words and use them to bring glory to Jesus.
