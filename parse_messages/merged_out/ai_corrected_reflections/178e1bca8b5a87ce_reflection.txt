Since so many people living near the Sea of Galilee depended on fishing for their livelihood, it is no surprise that Jesus recruited His first disciples from among fishermen: the two sets of brothers, Peter and Andrew and James and John. He called them to become spiritual fishermen. All Christians are called to be spiritual fishermen. With the net of the Gospel, they catch people for Christ, who died and rose again to save them. We too are called.
