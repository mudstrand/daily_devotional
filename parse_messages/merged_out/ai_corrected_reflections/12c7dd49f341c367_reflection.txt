Going to God's house can be a chore or a delight. For the psalmist, it was a delight. As a pilgrim attending one of the three great religious festivals, he rejoiced to worship with God's people in God's house. It is very easy for us to find worship a chore if we have unconfessed sin or if our love for God has cooled. But if we are close to God and enjoy His presence, we will be eager to worship and praise Him. Our attitude toward God will determine our view of worship. Let us once again approach Him with an attitude of gratitude!
