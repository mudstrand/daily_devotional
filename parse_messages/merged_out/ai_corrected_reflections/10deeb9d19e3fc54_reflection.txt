In Jesus' last moments with His disciples, He warns them (1) about further persecution. (2) He told them where, when, and why He was going away. (3) He assured them that they would not be left alone, but the Spirit would come. Jesus knew what lay ahead, and He did not want the disciples' faith shaken or destroyed. God wants you to know that you are not alone. You have the Holy Spirit to comfort you, teach you truth, and help you.
