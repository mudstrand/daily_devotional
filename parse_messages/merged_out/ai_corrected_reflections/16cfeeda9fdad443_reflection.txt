Have you ever felt that no one cared what happened to you? David had good reason to feel that way, and he wrote, "Hear my cry, for I am very low." Through prayer, we can pull out of our tailspin and be reminded that God cares for us very deeply. When we feel cornered by our enemies, only God can keep us safe.
