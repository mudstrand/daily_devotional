We may become so concerned about what we could be doing for God somewhere else that we miss opportunities right where we are. Paul says when you become a Christian, you should continue doing the work you have done all along — provided it is not immoral or unethical. Every job can become Christian work when you realize that it can be an opportunity to honor, serve, and speak out for Christ. Because God has placed you where you are, take advantage of every opportunity to serve Him.
