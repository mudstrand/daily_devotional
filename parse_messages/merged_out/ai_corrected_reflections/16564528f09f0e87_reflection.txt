No one is without sin. As soon as we confess our sins and repent, sinful thoughts and actions begin to creep back into our lives. We all need ongoing cleansing. We need to thank God that He is a merciful God who provides forgiveness by His mercy when we ask for it. We need to make confession and repentance a regular part of our talks with God. We need to rely on Him for the cleansing we need.
