The possibility of losing their lives was very real for the disciples as well as for Jesus. Real discipleship implies real commitment—pledging our whole existence to His service. If we try to save our physical life from death, pain, and discomfort, we may risk losing eternal life. If we protect ourselves from the pain God calls for us to suffer, we begin to die spiritually and emotionally. Our lives turn inward, and we lose our intended purpose. When we give our life in service to Christ, however, we discover the real purpose of living.
