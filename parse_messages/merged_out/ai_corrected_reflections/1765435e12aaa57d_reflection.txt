God has "planted eternity in the human heart." This means that we can never be completely satisfied with earthly pleasures and pursuits. Because we are created in God's image, (1) we have a spiritual thirst, (2) we have eternal value, and (3) nothing but the eternal God can truly satisfy us. He has built in us a restless yearning for the kind of perfect world that can only be found in His perfect rule. He has given us a glimpse of His creation. But it is only a glimpse; we cannot see into the future or comprehend everything. So we must trust him now and do His work on earth.
