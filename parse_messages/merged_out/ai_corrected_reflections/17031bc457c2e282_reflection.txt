Many of our church members are included in our prayer chain. Whenever there is a prayer concern or a praise report, text messages are sent to those in the prayer group. Technology has allowed the people to contact each other quickly and keep everyone updated. Praying brings people closer to Jesus; praying for others is good and pleasing in the sight of our Savior. Jesus honors the prayers of those who love Him. He unleashes hope, healing, mercy, and grace for those that we pray for. Let us join together and lift up those in need.
