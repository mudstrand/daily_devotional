God brings us back to Himself (reconcile us) by blotting out our sins (see also Ephesians 2:13-18) and making us right with Him. When we trust in Christ, we are no longer God's enemies or strangers or foreigners to Him. Because we have been reconciled to God, we have the privilege of encouraging others to do the same. Yes, we too have the task of reconciling people to Him.
