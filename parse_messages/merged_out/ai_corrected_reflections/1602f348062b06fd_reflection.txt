Here is the first thought—the second word in our verse today is THEREFORE. So what is the THEREFORE therefore? Well, it should draw us back to yesterday's verse. In verse 18, we are told that "THROUGH Jesus we have access to the Father." So we now see that because of this act, we are members of the household of God, which means we will receive the gift of eternal life.
