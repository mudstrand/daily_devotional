Will we ever really learn? We keep trying to go it alone without Him, even though we have this warning: "Apart from me you can do nothing." Jesus says that the only way to live a good life is to stay close to Him, like a branch attached to the vine. Yes, apart from Him our efforts are unfruitful. Have you been receiving the nourishment and life offered by Christ, the vine? If not, you have been missing the special gift He has for you.
