Satan seemed to be victorious in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3) and at the cross of Jesus. But God turned Satan's apparent victory into defeat when Jesus rose from the dead (Colossians 2:15; Hebrews 2:14, 15). So, death is no longer a source of dread and fear. Christ overcame it, and one day we will too. The law will no longer make sinners out of us just because we cannot keep it. Death has been defeated, and we have hope beyond the grave.
