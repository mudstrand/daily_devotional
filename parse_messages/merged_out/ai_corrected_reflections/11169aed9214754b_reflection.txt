What we need to realize here is that we are encouraged not to abandon our faith in times of persecution and suffering, but we must show our endurance and that our faith is real. What faith is really all about is that we are resting in what Christ has done for us in the past, as well as what He will do for us in the present and the future. (see Romans 8:12-25; Galatians 3:10-13).
