The phone numbers 9-1-1 in the United States will get you in touch with emergency help. It's so simple even preschoolers know what it is for, and how to use it. Often many situations we find ourselves in cannot be remedied by human resources. Many of our crises require divine assistance. When that happens, we can call a different kind of 9-1-1 --- Psalm 91:1. There we will find the help and protection of the Almighty God. When we face the crises of life, we often try to survive on our own. We forget that what we need most, is God's protection and the comfort of His presence, which are available for the asking. We need not fear life's dark shadows when we abide under the shadow of God's wings.
