People were flocking to hear Jesus preach and to have their diseases healed, but Jesus often withdrew to a quiet, solitary place to pray. I don't think anyone would disagree with me when I say: many things clamor for our attention, and we often run ourselves ragged attending to them. Like Jesus, however, we should take time to withdraw to a quiet and deserted place to pray. Our strength comes from God, and we can only be strengthened by spending time with Him.
