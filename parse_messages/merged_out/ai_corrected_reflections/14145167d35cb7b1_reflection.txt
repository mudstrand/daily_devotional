Sincerity and truth are extremely valuable because they are becoming more and more rare. Many people have become deceivers, liars, and flatterers—they believe they will get what they want by deception. As a king, David certainly faced these kinds of people, who hoped to win his favor and gain advancement through flattery. When we feel as though sincerity and truth have nearly gone out of existence, we still have one hope. That hope is the Word of God—God's words are as flawless as refined silver. So we need to listen closely when He speaks.
