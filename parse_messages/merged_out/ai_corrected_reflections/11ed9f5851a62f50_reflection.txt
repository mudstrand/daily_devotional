Let us give thanks for the assurance of eternal life! Because of our sinful flesh, we could never deserve such an assurance. Now, knowing this, we should be doubly grateful that He has given us the right to eternal life through union with His Son, our Savior. Let us also give thanks that while we live in the world, we can seek to serve Him fruitfully and to praise Him by the kind of life we live, as well as by our lips.
