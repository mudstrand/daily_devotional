The world has actually hated Christians, since they have come to realize the one true God. The reason the world hates Christians is because Christian values differ from the world. Because Christ's followers don't cooperate with the world by joining in on their sins, they are living accusations against the world's immorality. The world follows Satan's agenda, and Satan is the avowed enemy of Jesus and His people.
