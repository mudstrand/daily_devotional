We human beings are separated from God by sin, and only one person in the universe is our mediator and can stand between us and God and bring us together again. He is Jesus, who is both God and man. Jesus' sacrifice brought new life to all people. By His death, He paid our penalty for sin and purchased our freedom. Have you let Him bring you to the Father?
