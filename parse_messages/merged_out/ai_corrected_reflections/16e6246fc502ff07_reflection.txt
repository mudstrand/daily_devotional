Paul urges the Corinthians to go with the flow of God's self-giving in Christ by giving themselves to others, so that the downward and outward movement of grace comes full circle in the free flow of thanksgiving. Seeing things in an earthly, me-first way is miserly and petty. Instead, we should open our hands and hearts to receive God and extend them to give to our neighbor. Let us be generous in every way so that others will give thanks to God for us.
