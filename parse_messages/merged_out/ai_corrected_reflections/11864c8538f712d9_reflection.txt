Jesus said, "Do this in remembrance of Me as often as you drink of it." How do we remember Christ in the Lord's Supper? By thinking about what He did and why He did it. If the Lord's Supper becomes just a ritual or a pious habit, it no longer celebrates Christ's death and loses its significance. We should examine ourselves for any unconfessed sins or resentful attitude (grudges) before we come to the Lord's table. If we have not, we eat and drink condemnation unto ourselves.
