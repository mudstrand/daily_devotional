When we tell other people about the Good News, we have to depend upon the Holy Spirit to open their eyes and convince them that they need salvation. God's power, it is not our cleverness or persuasion, that changes people. Without the work of the Holy Spirit, our words are meaningless. The Holy Spirit not only convicts people of sin but also assures them of the truth of the Good News. The Thessalonians could see what Paul, Silas, and Timothy were preaching was true because these men lived it. Does your life confirm or contradict what you say you believe?
