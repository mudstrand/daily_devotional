The main thought in the area of religion is: Keep your eyes on God, not on people. Our motivation should not be the desire to be known as a praying person. Find an inner room in which to pray, where no one even knows you are praying, shut the door, and talk to God in secret. We should have no other motivation than to know our Father in heaven. It is impossible to carry on your life as a disciple without definite times of secret prayer.
