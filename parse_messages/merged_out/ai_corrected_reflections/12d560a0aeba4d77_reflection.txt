It would be interesting to know just how many ways people have tried to please God. But God has made His wishes clear. He wants His people to do what is right, love mercy, and walk humbly with Him. In your efforts to please God, examine these areas on a regular basis: Are you fair in your dealings with people? Do you show mercy to those who have wronged you? Are you learning humility?
