I often hear the statement, "I've been asking and asking, how come I don't get what I want?" The key to answered prayer is in the beginning of v. 7: "If you remain in Me and My words remain in you." What this is saying is, we need to keep our faith anchored in Christ and the cross. In doing so, whatever we ask will be in accordance with God's will for us. When a vine produces "much fruit," God is glorified, for in the process each day He sends the sunshine and rain to make the crops grow, and constantly He nurtured each tiny plant and prepared it to blossom. What a moment of glory for the Lord of the harvest when it is brought into the barns, mature and ready for use! He made it all happen! This farming analogy shows how God is glorified when people come into a right relationship with Him and begin to "produce much fruit" in their lives.
