I love the end of this parable, about those who respond to Jesus's invitation to follow Him. They "commit themselves to [the Word] with a good and upright heart. Through their resolve, they bear fruit." There are four types of soil in this parable: hard path, rocky soil, thorny ground, good soil. Read verses 11-15, then honestly evaluate your life. If you think your life is represented in verse 15, you must be truly committed to God's Word.
