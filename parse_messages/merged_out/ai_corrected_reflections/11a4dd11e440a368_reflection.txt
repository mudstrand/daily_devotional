We should realize that the Kingdom of God spreads through believers' concern and eagerness to help others. Here, we see several churches joining to help others beyond their own circle of friends and their own city. We should explore ways that we can link up with a ministry outside our own city, either through our church or through a Christian organization. By joining with other believers to do God's work, we increase Christian unity and help the kingdom grow.
