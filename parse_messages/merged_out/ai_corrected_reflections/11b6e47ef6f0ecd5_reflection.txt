Some Jewish males greeted each new day by praying, "Lord, I thank You that I am not a Gentile, a slave, or a woman." The role of a woman was enhanced by Christianity. Faith in Christ transcends these differences and makes all believers one in Christ. We need to make sure we do not impose distinctions that Christ has removed. Because all believers are His heirs, no one is more privileged or superior to anyone else. We need to make a point to seek out and appreciate people who are not just like us or our friends. We may find that we have a lot in common with them.
