Why do we so often try to go it alone in life when at every moment we have access to God? Didn't He say: "I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go?" (Genesis 28:15) Doesn't He also assure us that "He will never leave us or forsake us?" (Hebrews 13:5). What a comfort to know that God is always with us--we don't need to go through life alone. God's presence brings great comfort.
