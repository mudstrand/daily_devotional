John's willingness to decrease in importance shows unusual humility. Pastor (yes, pastors) and other Christian leaders can be tempted to focus more on the success of their ministries than on Christ. Beware of those who put more emphasis on their own achievements than on God's Kingdom. If you find that you have a problem with pride, pray this prayer: "Jesus, release me from all personal ambitions and selfish motives."
