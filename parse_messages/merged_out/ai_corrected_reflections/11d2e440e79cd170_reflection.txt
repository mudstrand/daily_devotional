The "ruler of the kingdom of the air" is Satan. Paul's readers believed that Satan and the evil spiritual forces inhabited the region between earth and the sky. And so Satan is pictured as ruling an evil spiritual kingdom—with the demons and those who are against Christ. Satan means "the accuser." He is also called the Devil (4:27). In the resurrection, Christ was victorious over Satan and his power. So now Christ is the permanent ruler of the whole world; Satan is only the temporary ruler of the part of the world that chooses to follow him.
