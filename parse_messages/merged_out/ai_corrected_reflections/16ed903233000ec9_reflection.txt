To hallow the name of God is to regard it as holy, to treat it differently from all other names. One of the ten commandments warned, "You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses His name" (Exod. 20:7). Those who hallow the name of God take special care to avoid light, meaningless, profane reference to God.
