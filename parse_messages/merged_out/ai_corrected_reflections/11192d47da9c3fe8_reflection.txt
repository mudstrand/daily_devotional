We need to keep in mind that we are "foreigners and nomads." This might be an awareness forced on us by circumstances. It may come late in life or as a result of difficult times. Yes, this world is not our home; we cannot live here forever (1 Peter 1:1). It is best if we do not become so attached to this world's desires and possessions that we can't move out at God's command.
