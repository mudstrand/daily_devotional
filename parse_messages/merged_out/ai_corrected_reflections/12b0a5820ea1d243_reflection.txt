True surrender is not simply surrender of our external life but surrender of our will, and once that is done, surrender is complete. The greatest crisis we will ever face is the surrender of our will. Yet God never forces a person's will to surrender, and He never begs. He patiently waits until that person willingly yields to Him. And once that battle has been fought, it never needs to be fought again. In (Matthew 11:28), Jesus gives this invitation: "Come to Me." The accepting of this invitation is a voluntary coming. Remember, He is waiting. Will you accept His invitation today?
