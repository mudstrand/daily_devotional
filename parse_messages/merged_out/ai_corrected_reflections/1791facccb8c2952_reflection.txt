Jesus cautions us to avoid setting a bad example or causing children to sin. He wants us to teach them what is good and true by both word and example. He wants all adults, particularly parents and teachers, to help children make the transition from the protected world that is the home to the larger world of their developing personal and social lives. Sooner or later they will have to come to grips with the evil around them. Christ is pleased when we teach children - and when we learn from them - for of such is God's Kingdom.
