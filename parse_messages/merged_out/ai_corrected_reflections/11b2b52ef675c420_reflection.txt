Believers today may still be in danger of acting as if Christ died for nothing. How? By replacing Jewish legalism with their own brand of Christian legalism, they are giving people extra laws to obey. By believing they can earn God's favor by what they do, they are not trusting completely in Christ's work on the cross. By struggling to appropriate God's power to change them, they are not resting in God's power to save them. If we could be saved by being good, then Christ would not have had to die. But the cross is the only way to salvation.
