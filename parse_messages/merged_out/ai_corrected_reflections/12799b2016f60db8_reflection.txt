When we allow God, our Shepherd, to guide us, we will have contentment. When we choose to sin and go our own way, we surely cannot blame God for the predicaments we find ourselves in. Our Shepherd knows the "green meadows" and "peaceful streams" that will restore us. We can only reach these places by following Him obediently. Let us remember this the next time we are tempted to go our own way rather than the Shepherd's way.
