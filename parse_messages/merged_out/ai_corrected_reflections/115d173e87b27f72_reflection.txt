Many Jews who looked for the Messiah refused to believe in Him when He came. God offered His salvation to the Gentiles ("other nations" and "people who were not looking for Me"); we need to remember that many Gentiles didn't even know about a Messiah, but they found Him and believed in Him. There are some religious people who are spiritually blind, while those who have never been in a church are sometimes the most responsive to God's message. Because appearances are deceiving, and we can't see into people's hearts, beware of judging beforehand who will respond to the Good News and who will not.
