God has a way of turning human errors so it fulfills His will. This truth clearly emerges from the story of Joseph in the Old Testament, where his brothers, because of their jealousy, sold him into slavery. Through this act, Joseph rose from slavery into leadership. Turning to the New Testament, we see even more clearly how God turned the hatred of Jesus' enemies into the good of mankind, turning the brutal crucifixion into the once-for-all sacrifice of His Son. While God carries out His will, the evildoers are still accountable to Him for their sins. Let us praise our Lord for all His blessings to us.
