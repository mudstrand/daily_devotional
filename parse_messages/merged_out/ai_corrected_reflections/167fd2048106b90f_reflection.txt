Jesus repeatedly helped multitudes of people, yet He didn't allow Himself to become haggard and hurried. He nurtured His connection with God through prayer. How is it with you? Do you take time with God to experience His strength and fulfillment? When we draw near to God, our minds are refreshed and our strength is renewed!
