David said he would speak of God's faithfulness and salvation to those around him. When we fully realize the impact of God's righteousness on our lives, we will not be able to keep it hidden. We will want to tell other people what God has done for us. If God's faithfulness has changed your life, don't be timid. It is natural to share a good bargain with others or recommend a skillful doctor. So it should also be natural to share what God has done for you.
