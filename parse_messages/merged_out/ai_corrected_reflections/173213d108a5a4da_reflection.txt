Jesus knocks at the door of our heart because He wants to save us and have fellowship with us. He is patient and persistent, trying to get through to us—not breaking and entering, but knocking. He allows us to decide whether or not to open our life to Him. Do not intentionally keep His life-changing presence and power on the other side of the door.
