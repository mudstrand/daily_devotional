It is not enough to hear or read the Word of God or even to know it well—we must also put it into practice. How easy it is to listen to a sermon and forget what the preacher said. How easy it is to read the Bible and not think about how we are to live differently. How easy it is to debate what a passage means and not live out that meaning. Remember, exposure to God's Word is not enough—it MUST lead to obedience.
