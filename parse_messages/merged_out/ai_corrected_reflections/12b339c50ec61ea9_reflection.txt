We must always remember the fact that God's creative purpose for us is to be one of His servants, and not ever confuse or cloud it with our own intentions. If we do, God will have to force our intentions aside no matter how much it may hurt. Once we realize that it is through the salvation of Jesus Christ that we are made perfectly fit for the purpose of God, we will understand why Jesus Christ is so strict and relentless in His demands. He demands absolute righteousness from His servants because He has put into them the very nature of God.
