God has given us the Scriptures for our instruction and encouragement. He has also given us His Spirit to help us to know His mind. Jesus said He was sending the Spirit to "guide [us] into all truth" (John 16:13). With the help of the Spirit, we can approach the Bible with confidence, knowing that through its pages God wants us to know Him and His ways. Let us remember to read our Bibles so we get to know its Author.
