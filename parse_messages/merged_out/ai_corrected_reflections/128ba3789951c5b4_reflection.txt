Let's not forget that every Christian is a citizen of the heavenly Jerusalem, even now, because Christ rules in our lives, the Holy Spirit is always with us, and we experience close fellowship with other believers. Thank God we have a traveling companion, not just one with whom to share the sights but one who keeps us on the road. That's our Savior, Jesus Christ, whose death and resurrection make Him the road to Mount Zion. The full and ultimate rewards and reality of the heavenly Jerusalem are depicted in Revelation 21. This would make for a good private lesson.
