A lot of poor advice is worth less than a little good advice. It is easy to get opinions from people who will tell you only what they think will please us, but such advice is not helpful. Instead, we should look to those who will tell us the truth, even when it hurts. Think about the people to whom you go for advice. What do you expect to hear from them?
