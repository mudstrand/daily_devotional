The reason I separated each of these phrases is to show how easy it is to take Scripture out of context and think that we must have a hand in our salvation if we do not read verses before and after. God must do this according to His means; we cannot deliver ourselves. Is righteousness given because of these works? Absolutely not! The prophet himself says in (45:24), "In the Lord is my righteousness." The careless treatment of the helpless reveals the lack of faith.
