"We are God's workmanship," another translation says, "We are God's masterpiece." It is easy for humans to be proud of what they have accomplished, and we have accomplished some extraordinary things, but let us never forget that our salvation is only something God can do. It is His powerful, creative work in us. Another thought: if God considers us His masterpiece, how dare we treat ourselves or others, for that matter, with disrespect or as inferior work.
