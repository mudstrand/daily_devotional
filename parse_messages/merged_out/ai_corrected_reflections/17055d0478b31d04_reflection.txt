I wonder how many of those desperate council members were transformed by Christ's death and resurrection. I wonder how many later longed to reword their complaints against Him, saying, "He caused a riot in my soul, and I'll never be the same again"? What one word describes the riot Jesus caused in your life? Redeemed? Restored? Alive? Hopeful? Why not—(Live it!)
