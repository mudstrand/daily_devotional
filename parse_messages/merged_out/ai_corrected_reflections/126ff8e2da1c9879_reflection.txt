This is one of the most powerful statements Jesus ever made. When He said that He existed before Abraham was born, He undeniably proclaimed His divinity. Not only did Jesus say He existed before Abraham; He also applied God's holy name ("I AM" - Exodus 3:14) to Himself. This name demands a response. It cannot be ignored. Yes, Jesus is God! How have you responded to Jesus, the Son of God?
