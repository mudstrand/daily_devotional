Have you ever worried about whether or not you really are a Christian? A Christian is anyone who has the Spirit of God living in him or her. If you have sincerely trusted Christ for your salvation and acknowledged Him as Lord, then the Holy Spirit lives within you and you are a Christian. You can be assured that you have the Holy Spirit because Jesus promised that He would send Him. Since you now believe that Jesus Christ is God's Son and that eternal life comes through Him (1 John 5:5), you will begin to act as Christ directs (Romans 8:5; Galatians 5:22, 23); you will find help in your daily problems and in your praying (Romans 8:26, 27). You will be empowered to serve God and do His will (Acts 1:8; Romans 12:6 ff), and you will become part of God's plan to build up His church (Ephesians 4:12, 13).
