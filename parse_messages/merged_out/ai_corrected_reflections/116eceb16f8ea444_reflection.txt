Paul called the Corinthians babes in their Christian life, because they were not yet spiritually healthy and mature. The proof of this was that they quarreled like children, allowing divisions to distract them. Immature Christians are "worldly," controlled by their own desires; mature believers are in tune with God's desires. How much influence do your desires have on your life? Your goal should be to let God's desires be yours. Being controlled by your own desires will stunt your Christian growth.
