Paul was shown that keeping the law does not bring salvation. Here, he adds that breaking the law is not what brings death. Death is the result of Adam's sin and the sins we all commit, even if they do not resemble Adam's sin. Paul reminds us that for thousands of years, the law had not been explicitly given, and yet people died. The law was added, he explains in 5:20, to help people see their sinfulness, to show them the seriousness of their offenses, and drive them to God for mercy and pardon. This was true in Moses' day, and still is today. The law shows who we are and what we were created to be.
