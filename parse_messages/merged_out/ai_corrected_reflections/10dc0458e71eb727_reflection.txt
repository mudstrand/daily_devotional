When things are going well, we feel elated. When hardship comes, we often sink into depression. But true joy transcends rolling waves of circumstance. True joy comes from a consistent relationship with Jesus Christ. When our lives are intertwined with His, He will help us walk through adversity without sinking into those debilitating lows, and we will be able to manage prosperity without moving into deceptive highs. (In other words, our lives will remain on more of an even keel). The joy of living with Jesus Christ daily will keep us levelheaded, no matter how high or low our circumstances.
