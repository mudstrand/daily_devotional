Some people talk a lot about faith, but that is all it is—talk. They might know all the right words to say, but their lives don't reflect God's power. Paul says that the Kingdom of God is to be lived, not just discussed. There is a big difference between knowing the right words and living them out. Don't be content to have the right answers about Christ. Let your life show that God's power is really working in you.
