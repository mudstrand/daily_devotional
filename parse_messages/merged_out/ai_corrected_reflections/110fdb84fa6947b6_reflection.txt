If our heart is not changed, following God's rules will be unpleasant and difficult. We will rebel against being told how to live. The Holy Spirit, however, gives us new desires, helping us want to obey God (check out Philippians 2:12, 13). With a new heart, we find that serving God is the greatest joy.
