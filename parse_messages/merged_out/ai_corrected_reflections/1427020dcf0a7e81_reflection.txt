David wanted God's guidance—but how do we receive God's guidance? Well, the very first step is to want to be guided and to realize that God's primary guidance system is in His Word, the Bible. Psalm 119 tells of the endless knowledge found in God's Word. By reading it and constantly learning from it, we will gain the wisdom to understand God's direction for our lives. We may be tempted to demand answers from God, but David asked for direction. When we are willing to seek God, learn from His Word, and obey His commands, then we will receive His specific guidance.
