When a burden is too heavy for a single ant, other ants help carry it. That is what God's people are to do. They are all members of Christ's body, the church. Paul said, "Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ" (Galatians 6:2). The law of Christ is love. When we love others, we want to help.
