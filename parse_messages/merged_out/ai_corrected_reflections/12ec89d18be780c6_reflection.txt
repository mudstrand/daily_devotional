As a shepherd cares for all the needs of his flock, God cares for every human need: physical, emotional, and spiritual. God provides abundantly and daily. Restores. A shepherd protects his sheep and keeps them alive by his care. The Good Shepherd does even more. He cares for every human need. Ultimately, Christ alone restores our soul as he sacrificed His life for His sheep. Shepherds lead sheep along safe paths, to the proper destination. Jesus Himself is the way, the righteous path (John 14:6).
