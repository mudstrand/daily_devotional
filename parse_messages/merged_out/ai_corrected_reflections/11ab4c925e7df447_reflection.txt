Paul was not merely revealing his feelings; he was defending his authority as an apostle of Jesus Christ. Paul had been hurt by the church of Corinth by their doubting and questioning him, so he defended himself for the cause of the "Good News." When people question you, do you only think of saving your reputation, or are you more concerned about what people will think about Christ?
