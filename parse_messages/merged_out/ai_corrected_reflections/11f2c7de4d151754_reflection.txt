What makes the temptation of power so seemingly irresistible? Is it that power offers an easy substitute for the hard task of love? It seems easier to be God than to love God, easier to control people than to love people, easier to own life than to love life. The long, painful history of the church is the history of people ever and again tempted to choose power over love, control over the cross, being a leader over being led. Those who have resisted this temptation are truly saints, and in the end, give us hope.
