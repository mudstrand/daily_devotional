Jesus is more than an example to us, He is also our equipment. Through the Holy Spirit, He gives us gifts and abilities to fulfill God's will. He made us recipients of all God's spiritual blessings: reconciliation and peace, forgiveness and life eternal. And as the beneficiaries of the fullness of divine grace, we are deeply moved. In Martin Luther's words, "That I may be His own and live under Him in His kingdom."
