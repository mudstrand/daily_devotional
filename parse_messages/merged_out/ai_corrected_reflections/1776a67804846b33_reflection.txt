How quickly God can bring down the proud and powerful! As the psalmist warned, "Do not put your trust in mortal men, who cannot save. When their spirit departs, they return to the ground; on that very day their plans come to nothing" (Psalm 146:3-4). Who alone saves? Of course, it is Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who by the works of His own hands, the travail of His soul in the Garden of Gethsemane, and His death on the cross restored what Adam and Eve forfeited: the inheritance of eternal life. Let us remember to ask the heavenly Father to give us the humble mind of Jesus Christ and to help us walk in His steps.
