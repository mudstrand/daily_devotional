In chapter 6, we see that Solomon had asked God to make provisions for the people when they sinned. God answered with four conditions for forgiveness: (1) Humble yourself by admitting your sins. (2) Pray to God, asking for forgiveness. (3) Seek God continually. (4) Turn from sinful behavior. We need to remember that true repentance is more than mere talk; it is a changed behavior. Whether we sin individually, as a group, or as a nation, following these steps will lead to forgiveness—God will answer our earnest prayers.
