Planning for tomorrow is time well spent; worrying about tomorrow is time wasted. Sometimes it's difficult to tell the difference. Careful planning is thinking ahead about goals, steps, and schedules, and trust in God's guidance. When done well, planning can alleviate worry. Worries, by contrast, are consumed by fear and find it difficult to trust God. Don't let worries about tomorrow affect your relationship with God today. (Remember, worry is like a rocking chair, going back and forth and getting you nowhere.)
