Mosses wanted to know God's name so the Hebrew people would know who sent him. God called Himself "I am who I am," a name describing His eternal power and unchanging character. Now in a world where values, morals, and laws change constantly, we can find stability and security in our unchanging God. What God promised to the great patriarchs hundreds of years earlier, He would fulfill in Moses.
