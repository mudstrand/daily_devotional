If you read the first 15 verses of Psalm 38, you will notice that David poured out his struggles and complaint to God. The answer for our destructive foolishness is to grasp the wisdom of God. (Proverbs 9:10) reminds us, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding." Only by allowing God to transform us can we overcome the foolish decisions that cause us so much trouble. With His loving guidance, we can follow the pathway of godly wisdom.
