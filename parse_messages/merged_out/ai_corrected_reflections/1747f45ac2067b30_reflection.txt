It goes without saying that God is incomprehensible; we cannot know Him completely. We can have some knowledge about Him, for the Bible is full of details about who God is, how can we know Him, and how we have an eternal relationship with Him. But we can never know enough to answer all of life's questions (Ecclesiastes 3:11), to predict our future, or to manipulate God for our own ends. Life always creates more questions than we have answers, and we must constantly go to God for fresh insights into life's dilemmas. (See Job 37:19-24)
