Astrologers, normally called wise men, traveled thousands of miles to see the King of the Jews. When they finally found him, they responded with joy, worship, and gifts. This is so different from the approach people often take today. Most expect God to come looking for them to explain Himself, prove who He is, and give them gifts. But those who are wise still seek and worship Jesus today, not for what they can get, but for who He really is.
