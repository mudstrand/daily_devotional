"Who wants to go to heaven if all they do there is sing?" asked a teenager. The Scriptures do speak about believers singing in heaven. When we look closely, though, we note that it is not so much the singing that is stressed, but to Whom and about what we will sing. As the bodies of the Egyptian soldiers washed ashore, the Israelites sang. Let out of Egypt by the Lord, they had camped, rejoicing beside the Red Sea. Of course, we know it wasn't long before their balloon of joy popped. Pharaoh's troops had been right behind them. The situation looked hopeless till the Lord led them to safety through the dammed-up waters of the sea. Those walls of water became a weapon, wiping out Egypt's strike force. It was this victory that the Israelites sang about. When will the world learn that fighting with God is no contest? Or, better still, when will we learn? The more we are assured of His victory, the more we will be ready to sing to Him.
