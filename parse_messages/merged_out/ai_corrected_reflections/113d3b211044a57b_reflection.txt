We need to pray that God would give us the grace to shun the distortion of His Word in suggesting that the unrighteousness of man commends the Righteousness of God. Rather, we need to realize, God's righteousness is manifested, and His name is glorified when He imposes penalty on man's unrighteousness. God is the divine Judge over the world. He will execute judgment in sovereign Justice. His judgment will be exercised "from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of men." (Romans 1:18)
