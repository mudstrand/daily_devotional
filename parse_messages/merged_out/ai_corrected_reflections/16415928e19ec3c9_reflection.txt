Whether a "dream come true" is good or bad, depending on the nature of the dream or desire. It is pleasant to achieve worthwhile goals, but all goals are not worth pursuing. When you set your heart on something, you may lose your ability to assess it objectively. With your desire blinding your judgment, you may proceed with an unwise relationship, a wasteful purchase, or a poorly conceived plan. Faithfulness is a virtue, but stubbornness is not.
