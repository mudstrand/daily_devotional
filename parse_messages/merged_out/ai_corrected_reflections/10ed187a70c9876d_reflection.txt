Mary didn't recognize Jesus at first. Her grief had blinded her. She couldn't see Him because she didn't expect to see Him. Then He spoke her name, and immediately she recognized Him. Can you imagine the love that flooded her heart when she heard her Savior saying her name? Jesus is near you, and He is calling your name. Can you, like Mary, regard Him as your Lord?
