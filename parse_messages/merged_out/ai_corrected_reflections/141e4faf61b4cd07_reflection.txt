God promises to give us strength to meet challenges, but He does not promise to eliminate them. If He gave us no rough roads to walk, no mountains to climb, and no battles to fight, we would not grow. He does not leave us alone with our challenges, but instead, He stands beside us, teaches us, and strengthens us to face them.
