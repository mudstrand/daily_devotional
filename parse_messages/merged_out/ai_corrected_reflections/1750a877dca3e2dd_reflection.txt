We are saved by faith, not deeds. But love for others and for God is the response of those whom God has forgiven. God's forgiveness is complete, and Jesus said that those who are forgiven much, love much (Luke 7:47). Because faith expresses itself through love, you can check your love for others as a way to monitor your faith.
