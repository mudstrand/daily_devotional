Prayer is our approach to God, and we are to come "boldly with confidence." Some Christians approach God meekly with heads hung low, afraid to ask Him to meet their needs. Others pray flippantly, giving little thought to what they say. Let us come with reverence because He is our King. But also come with bold assurance because He is our Friend and Counselor.
