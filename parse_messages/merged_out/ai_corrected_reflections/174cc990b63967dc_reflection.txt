Many have wondered about Jesus' statement that if we have faith and do not doubt, we can move mountains. Jesus, of course, was not suggesting that His followers use prayer as some "magic" act. Instead, He was making a strong point about the disciples' (and our) lack of faith. What kinds of mountains do you face? Have you really talked to God about them? How strong is your faith?
