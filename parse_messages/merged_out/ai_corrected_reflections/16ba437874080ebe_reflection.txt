Wherever we go nowadays, we see signs encouraging us to wash our hands. We see in these two verses that David spoke of the importance of clean hands, but for a very different reason. Here, "clean hands" is not in reference to personal hygiene but a metaphor for our spiritual condition being cleansed from sin. (1 John 1:9) It speaks of a life committed to what is right and godly, enabling us to stand before our Lord in the privilege of worship.
