As the Corinthians waited for Paul's next visit, they were told to: (1) be on their guard against spiritual dangers, (2) stand firm in the faith, (3) be courageous, (4) be strong, and (5) do everything with kindness and in love. Today, as we wait for the return of Christ, we should follow the same instructions.
