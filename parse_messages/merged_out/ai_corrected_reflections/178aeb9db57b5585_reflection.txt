The verse above gives insight into a difference between the Old and New Testaments. God's ceremonial law prescribed ever so many things, not only pertaining to the Sabbath and to circumcision, but down to the details of the High Priest's robe. As New Testament people, we are accustomed to exercising freedom as to the design and use of a pastor's vestments, the order of worship in church services, and the like. We have freedom in such things because God has neither commanded nor forbidden them in the New Testament. But any freedom is always to be used responsibly.
