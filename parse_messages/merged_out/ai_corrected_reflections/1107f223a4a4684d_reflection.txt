Jesus's human life was not a script that He passively followed. It was a life He chose freely (John 10:17, 18). It was a continuous process of making the will of God the Father His own. Jesus chose to obey, even though obedience led to suffering and death. Because Jesus obeyed perfectly, even under great trial, He can help us obey, no matter how difficult obedience seems to be.
