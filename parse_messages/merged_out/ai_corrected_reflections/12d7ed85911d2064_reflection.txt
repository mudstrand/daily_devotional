I believe it is our natural inclination to feel uncomfortable around people who are different from us, and then to gravitate toward those who are similar to us. But when we allow our differences to separate us from our fellow believers, we are disregarding clear biblical teaching. We should make a point of seeking out and appreciating people who are not just like us and our friends. We just may find out that we have a lot in common with them.
