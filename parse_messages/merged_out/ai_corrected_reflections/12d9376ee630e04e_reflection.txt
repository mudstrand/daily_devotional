Paul says: "Walk." What he means is "be in line with," or "Keep in step." "Walk" is a common term that can describe one's life or way of life. Paul's warning is because as soon as we receive the Holy Spirit in baptism, a lifelong struggle with the old Adam begins. This becomes quite clear in vs. 17. When we are led by the Spirit, it is not by coercion but by a gentle and loving grasp. It's like when a child puts its hand into the hand of a beloved and trusted father.
