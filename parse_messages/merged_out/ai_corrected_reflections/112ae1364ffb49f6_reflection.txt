These words reveal the consequences of refusing to follow the gospel light that has been offered by our Lord. He simply leaves such stubborn ones to the lists of their own hearts. Powers of evil are so overwhelming to man that if the Lord forsakes him, he will be immersed in all manner of sin and shame. If God did not check this deluge, there could be no social order in existence. Even where the powers of grace are hindered, God has provided checks against the destruction that wickedness causes. Some of these checks are common sense, fear of shame, fear of injury, and a desire for self-respect. But when the judgment of God is directed against gross wrongs of mankind, He withholds the checks against the outbreak of sin. So, let us always give God the glory that is due Him.
