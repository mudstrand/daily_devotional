Paul was not boasting; he gave God the credit for all his accomplishments. While false teachers boast about their own power and success, Paul expresses his humility before God. No one can claim to be adequate without God's help. No one is competent to carry out the responsibilities of God's calling in his or her own strength. Without the Holy Spirit's enabling, our natural talent can carry us only so far. As Christ's witnesses, we need the character and special strength that only God gives.
