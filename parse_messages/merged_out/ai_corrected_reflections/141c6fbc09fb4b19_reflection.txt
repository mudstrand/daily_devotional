We truly deceive ourselves when we measure our happiness or contentment in life by the amount of wealth we possess. When we put riches at the top of our value system, we let power, pleasure, and financial security overshadow the eternal value of our relationship with God. Many often think they will be content when they get riches, only to discover they do not satisfy—and the pleasures fade away. The true measure of happiness or contentment is found in God's love and in doing His will. You will find true happiness if you put your relationship with God above earthly riches.
