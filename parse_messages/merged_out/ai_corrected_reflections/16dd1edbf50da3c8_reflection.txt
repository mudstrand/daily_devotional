In the verse for today, Paul acknowledged the existence of sorrow and at the same time identified the reason for rejoicing: Christ Jesus, who redeemed us and rose victorious over all sorrow and every problem. Alongside the rain, we have the very real Son. If we have the Son, we can overcome mentally and spiritually the storms of life.
