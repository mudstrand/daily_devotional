Love is more important than knowledge. Oh, yes, knowledge can make us look good and feel important, but we can all too easily develop an arrogant, know-it-all attitude. Many people with strong opinions are unwilling to listen to and learn from God and others. We can obtain God's knowledge only by loving Him (see James 3:17, 18). And we can know and be known by God only when we model Him by showing love (see 1 John 4:7, 8).
