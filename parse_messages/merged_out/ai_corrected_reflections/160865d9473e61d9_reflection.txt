There was a gift for each of us left under the Tree of Life 2,000 years ago by Him whose birthday we are celebrating today. The gift was not withheld from anyone. Some have left the gifts unclaimed. Some have accepted the gift and carry it around, but have failed to remove the wrappings and look inside to discover the hidden splendor. The packages are all alike: in each is a scroll on which is written, "All that the Father hath is thine. Take and live."
