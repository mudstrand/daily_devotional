Romans 12:18 tells us we are to do our part to live in peace with everyone, as far as possible. We should never envy evil people, even though some may be extremely popular or extremely rich. No matter how much they have, it will fade and vanish like grass that withers and dies. Those who follow God live differently from the wicked, and in the end, will have treasures in heaven.
