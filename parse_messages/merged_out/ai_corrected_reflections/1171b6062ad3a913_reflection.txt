The foundation of the church—of all believers—is Jesus Christ. Paul laid this foundation by (preaching Christ) when he began the church in Corinth. Whoever builds the church—officers, teachers, preachers, parents, and others—must build with high-quality materials (right doctrine and right living) that meet God's standard. Paul is challenging future leaders to have sound preaching and teaching.
