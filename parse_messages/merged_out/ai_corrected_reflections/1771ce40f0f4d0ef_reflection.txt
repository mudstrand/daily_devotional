It also warns us. We are to confront those who are sinning (see 1 Corinthians 5:12, 13), but we must not judge who is a better servant of Christ. When you judge someone, you invariably consider yourself better, and that is arrogant. Some things we need to gladly leave to the Lord. When He comes again, He will take things in hand and settle them once and for all.
