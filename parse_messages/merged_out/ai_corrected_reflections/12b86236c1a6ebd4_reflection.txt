I think you will agree with me that Jesus describes leadership from a whole new perspective. Instead of using people, we are to serve them. Jesus' mission was to serve others and to give His life away. What Jesus is saying is "A real leader has a servant's heart." Servant leaders appreciate others' worth and realize that they're not above any job. If you see something that needs to be done, don't wait to be asked. Take the initiative and do it like a faithful servant.
