How can we humble ourselves? Some people try to give the appearance of humility in order to manipulate others. Some think that humility means putting themselves down. Truly humble people compare themselves only with Christ; they realize their sinfulness and understand their limitations. Humility is not self-degradation; it is realistic self-assessment and commitment to serve.
