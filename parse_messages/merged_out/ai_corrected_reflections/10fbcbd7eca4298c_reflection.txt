The author here has just quoted Psalm 102:25-27. When he speaks of the earth and the heavens rolled up like a garment, he is revealing that the earth is not permanent or indestructible. Jesus' authority is established over all of creation, so we dare not treat any created objects or earthly resources as more important than He is. So as we are coming to the close of 2006, let us resolve to put God first in our life.
