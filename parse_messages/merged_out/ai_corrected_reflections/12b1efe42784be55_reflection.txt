We live in a culture much like the Corinthians did. It is a culture filled with moral depravity and sin-inducing pressures. Paul's encouragement is that (1) temptation happens to everyone, so don't feel you have been singled out; (2) others have resisted temptation, and so can you; (3) any temptation can be resisted because God will show you a way out. God will help you in resisting temptation by helping you (1) recognize those people and situations that give you trouble, (2) run from anything you know is wrong, (3) choose to do only what is right, (4) pray for God's help, and (5) seek friends who love God and can offer help when you are tempted. Running from a tempting situation is your first step on the way to victory (2 Timothy 2:22).
