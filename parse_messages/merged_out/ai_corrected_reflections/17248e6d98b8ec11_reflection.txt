Like earthly parents, God feels pleasure when He sees His children doing things worth bragging about. And what better way to please Him than imitating Jesus? That means serving others with a self-sacrificial love—even when it's inconvenient or costly. Putting others' needs above our own desires. Grabbing every opportunity to be the hands and feet of Jesus. Every day we have the chance to give more reason for God to feel proud of us.
