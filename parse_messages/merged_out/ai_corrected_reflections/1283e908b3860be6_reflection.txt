This is a beautiful picture of the necessary sacrifice of Jesus. Unless a kernel of wheat is planted in the soil, it will not become a blade of wheat producing more seeds. So, Jesus really had to die to pay the penalty for our sins, but also to show His power over death. His resurrection proves He has eternal life. Because Jesus is God, Jesus can give this same eternal life to all who believe in Him.
