CORRECTED_TEXT: It's time for an honest assessment of ourselves. What is your response when a fellow Christian is honored? How do you respond when someone is suffering? Scriptures tell us we are to be happy with those who are happy, and if they are sad, share their sorrow (Romans 12:15). Too often, unfortunately, we are jealous of those who rejoice and apathetic to those who weep. As believers, we are in the world together; there is no such thing as private or individualistic Christianity. We need to get involved in the lives of others and not just enjoy our own relationship with God.
