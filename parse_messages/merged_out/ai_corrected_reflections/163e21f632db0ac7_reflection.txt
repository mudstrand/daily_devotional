You have not mastered self-control if you do not control what you say. Words can cut and destroy. James recognized this truth when he stated, "The tongue is a small thing, but what enormous damage it can do." (James 3:5) If you want to be self-controlled, begin with your tongue. Stop and think before you react or speak.
