Jesus was and is moved by the condition of the people's lives. He came to be the Shepherd, the one who could show people how to avoid life's pitfalls (see John 10:14). Jesus looked at the crowds following Him and referred to them as a field ripe for harvest. Many people are ready to give their lives to Christ if someone would show them how. Jesus commands us to pray that people will respond to this need for workers. Often, when we pray for something, God answers our prayers by using us. Be prepared for God to use you to show another person the way to Him.
