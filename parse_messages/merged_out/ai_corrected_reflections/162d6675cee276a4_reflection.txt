Kings—rulers—princes—nobles. Wisdom is a crucial asset for those who govern. Their just government evidences the wisdom of God, who sets governments in place and uses them for His purpose. Let us remember to pray for our government officials, federal, state, and local, that they would seek Godly wisdom.
