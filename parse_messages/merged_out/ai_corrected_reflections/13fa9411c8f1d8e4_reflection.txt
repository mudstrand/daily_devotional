"The Lord's plans stand firm forever." Are you frustrated by the inconsistencies you see in others or even yourself? God is completely trustworthy—His intentions never change. There is a promise that whatever is good and perfect comes to us from the Creator who never changes (James 1:17). When you wonder if there is anyone you can trust, remember that God is completely consistent. Let Him counsel you.
