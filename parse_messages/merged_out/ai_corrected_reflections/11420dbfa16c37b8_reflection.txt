A question that is often asked is, "Why does God save us by faith alone?" First of all: Faith eliminates the pride of human effort, because faith is not a deed that we do. Second: Faith exalts what God has done, not what we do. Third: Faith admits that we can't keep the law or measure up to God's standards, we need help. Fourth: Faith is based on our relationship with God, not our performance for God. Faith does not wipe out the Old Testament. Rather, it makes God's dealings with the Jewish people understandable. (See Galatians 3:24-29 and 1 Timothy 1:8 for more on this concept.)
