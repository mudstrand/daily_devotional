Some of us have made wrong choices in our lives, but our passwords and deeds need not define our future in God's eyes. There is always a fresh start. When we ask for His forgiveness, we take a first step toward restoring our relationship with Him and with others. "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness." (1 John 1:9) Each new day gives us new reasons to praise the Lord.
