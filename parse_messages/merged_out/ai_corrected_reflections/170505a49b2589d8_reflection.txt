Our lives are not just about the clamoring GPS of the law pushing us to the final destination—not if that makes us miss our true Savior. Jesus leads us on a rich path. Each day, each moment, is an opportunity to commune with Him, to learn to follow Him, to allow Him to change us. Yes, He grants eternal life. But He also grants eternal purpose to our present days. Ask Him to reveal His purpose for you today.
