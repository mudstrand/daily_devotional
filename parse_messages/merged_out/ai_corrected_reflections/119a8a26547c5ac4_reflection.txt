The valuable treasure we have is the message of salvation in Jesus Christ, which has been entrusted by God to us frail human beings (jars of clay). We see that Paul's focus was not on the perishable container but on its priceless contents—God's power dwelling in us. Though we are weak, God uses us to spread His Good News, and He gives us power to do His work. Knowing the power is His, not ours, should keep us from pride and motivate us to keep daily contact with God, our power source. Our responsibility is to let people see God through us.
