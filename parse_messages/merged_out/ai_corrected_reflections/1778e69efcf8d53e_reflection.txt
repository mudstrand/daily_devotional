Divine grace really means that we are Christ's guests. We come to His holy meal empty-handed. Salvation is God's outright gift—we contribute nothing. The Good Shepherd, who laid down His life on our behalf, leads us to the "green grass" of His Word, providing all we need for our spiritual nurture. We sing, "The Lord is My Shepherd, I'll not want; He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me by quiet waters."
