You say you belong to the Lord, but do you show reverence to Him? To reverence the Lord means to show deep respect and honor to Him. We demonstrate true reverence by our humble attitude and genuine worship. We also need to remember that God knows what we need, and our deepest needs are spiritual. Many Christians, even though they face unbearable poverty and hardship, still have enough spiritual nourishment to live for God. David was saying that if you have God, you have all you really need. God is enough.
