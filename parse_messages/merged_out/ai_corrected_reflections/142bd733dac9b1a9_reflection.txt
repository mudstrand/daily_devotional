One could say these people were two-faced by what we see in verse 3: "They were friendly to their neighbors while planning evil in their hearts." We really need to think about our attitude, oh, and our pleasures—if they do not have God's blessing, they just may destroy us. Leaving God out of our life will allow sin to come in. God wants us to enjoy life, but to avoid those activities that could lead us away from Him.
