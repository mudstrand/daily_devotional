Jesus was giving the disciples their Spirit-powered and Spirit-guided mission, to preach the Good News about Jesus so people's sins might be forgiven. The Disciples did not have the actual power to forgive sins (only God can forgive sins), but Jesus gave them the privilege of telling new believers that their sins have been forgiven because they had accepted Jesus' message. (see Matthew 16:19) All believers have this same privilege. We can announce forgiveness of sins with certainty when we ourselves have found repentance and faith.
