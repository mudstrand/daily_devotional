The people had no appetite for God's Word when prophets like Amos brought it. Because of their apathy, God said He would take away even the opportunity to hear His word. We have His Word, the Bible. But many still look everywhere for answers to life's problems except in the Scriptures. You can help them by directing them to the Bible, showing them the parts that speak to their special needs and questions. God's Word is available to us. Let us help people know it before a time comes when they cannot find it.
