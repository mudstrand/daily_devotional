In moral and spiritual areas of our life, we can foolishly pursue dangerous things God tells us to avoid because of His love for us. Instead of following the ways of the world, a wiser approach would be to read the book of Proverbs, which contains many positive ways to elude the snares of life. Let us follow the Lord's guidance each day.
