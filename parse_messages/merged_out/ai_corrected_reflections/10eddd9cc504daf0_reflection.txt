Jesus has again identified himself with his Father. He tells his disciples by whose authority he did his work. Then he passed the job to his disciples of spreading the Good News of salvation around the world. Now we need to remember: (1) Our authority comes from God, and (2) Jesus has demonstrated by words and actions how to accomplish the job he has given to us. As the Father sent Jesus, Jesus sends his followers—every believer.
