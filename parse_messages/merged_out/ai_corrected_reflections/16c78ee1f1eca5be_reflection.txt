The songwriter of Psalm 100 took his allegiance to the Lord seriously and wanted others to do the same. When we were kids, we were told to sit still and be quiet in church. (Right?) But God's goodness and grace should motivate us to freely express our love and allegiance to the Lord. We need to push back the boundaries of restraint and learn what it means to be expressive in our praise to God. Worship is a time to focus on our Creator, Redeemer, and Shepherd, and celebrate what He has done for us.
