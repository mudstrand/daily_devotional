We all face storms that threaten to confuse and disorient us. It may be a doctor's office, a friend who has betrayed you, or a shattered dream. Those are the times to be especially careful. When you are blinded by life's disappointment, don't trust your instincts. Go to your Bible and trust God to guide you. He promised, "I WILL INSTRUCT YOU AND TEACH YOU IN THE WAY YOU SHOULD GO." (Psalm 32:8) THE CLOSER WE WALK WITH GOD, THE CLEARER WE WILL SEE HIS GUIDANCE.
