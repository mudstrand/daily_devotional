I believe that miracles happen every day, and Jesus knows what I need before I make my requests, but I'm still required to pray. Have you ever wondered why? It is to open ourselves up to a personal relationship with the Savior. As I make bold requests from the Lord, I boldly receive His abundance and provisions for family, friends, and myself. So why don't we all come boldly to the throne of grace each morning?
