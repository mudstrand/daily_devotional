When the right time came, God sent His Son to die for our sins. The Jews had been waiting and waiting for the Messiah—but God's timing was perfect. I think we have all been guilty of wondering if God will ever answer our prayers, but we must never doubt Him or give up hope. At the right time, He will respond. Are you waiting on God's timing? Trust His judgment and trust that He has your interests in mind.
