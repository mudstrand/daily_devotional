When a farmer has no cattle, the stable will be clean, but he will be unable to make a living. The only way to keep your life clean of people problems is to keep it free from people. But if your life is empty of people, it is useless, and if you live only for yourself, your life loses its meaning. Instead of avoiding people, we should serve others, share our faith, and work for justice. Is your life free but empty? Or does it give evidence of your serving God wholeheartedly?
