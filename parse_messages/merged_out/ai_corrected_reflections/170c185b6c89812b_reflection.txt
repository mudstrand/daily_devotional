Jesus spent time with whoever needed or wanted to hear the message—poor, rich, bad, and good. We too must befriend those who need Christ, even if they do not seem to be ideal companions. Are there people you are neglecting because of their reputation? They may be the ones who most need to hear and see the message of Christ's love in and from you. Are you trying the "get a grip" instead of resting in the grip of Jesus?
