Yes, Jesus came to save sinners, which includes all of us. He loves us, He welcomes us into His presence, and calls us to follow Him. If we will walk with Him, we will grow more and more spiritually fit. It is up to us to reach out to those who need a Savior. Jesus's arms of welcome are always open.
