Many have had the sad experience of being abandoned by their father and mother. Broken homes, differences of belief, addiction to drugs or alcohol—and the list goes on. These things can cause children to feel isolated and crippled. Even as adults, the pain may linger. God can take that place in our life. He can fill that void and heal that hurt. He can direct us to adults who may take the role of a father or mother for us. His love is sufficient for all our needs.
