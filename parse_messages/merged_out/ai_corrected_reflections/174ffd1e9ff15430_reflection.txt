The Corinthians were called to examine and test themselves to see if they were Christians. Just as we get physical checkups, Paul urges us to give ourselves spiritual checkups. We should look for a growing awareness of Christ's presence and power in our lives. Then we will know if we are true Christians or merely imposters. If we are not actively seeking to grow closer to God, we are drawing farther away from Him.
