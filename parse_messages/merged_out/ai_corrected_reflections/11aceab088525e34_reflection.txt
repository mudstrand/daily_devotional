God's plan all along was to save us by Jesus' death. We have been rescued from the power of this present world, a world ruled by Satan and full of cruelty, tragedy, temptation, and deception. Being rescued from this evil world doesn't mean that we are taken out of it, but that we are no longer enslaved to it. You were saved to live for God. Does your life reflect your gratitude for being rescued? Have you transformed your loyalty from this world to Christ?
