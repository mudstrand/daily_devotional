"Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead," Paul wrote. In these words, we see our Savior's Godforsakenness because of our sin's burden. In these words, we see tender hands take Him from the cross and deposit Him in the tomb. And then, on Easter, we see His triumphant resurrection, God's stamp of approval on all that His Son had done. Yes, remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead. My sins are gone. My grave will open. Heaven is my real home.
