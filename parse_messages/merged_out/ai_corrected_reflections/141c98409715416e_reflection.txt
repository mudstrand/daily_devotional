The protection that God affords His people is limitless—and it can take many forms. David characterized God's care with five military symbols. God is like: (1) A rock that cannot be moved by any who would harm us. (2) A fortress or place of safety where the enemy cannot follow. (3) A shield that comes between us and harm. (4) Strength of salvation, a symbol of might and power. (5) A stronghold far above our enemies. David praises God for His glorious works and blessings through the years. If you need protection, look to God.
