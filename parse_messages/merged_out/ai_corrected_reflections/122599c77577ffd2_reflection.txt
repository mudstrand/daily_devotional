How often, when we are asked to do something, do we act like Moses and make excuses? Moses made excuses because he felt inadequate for the job God gave him to do. Now it was quite natural for him to feel that way. He was inadequate by himself. But God wasn't asking him to work alone. He offered Moses other resources to help (God himself, Aaron, and the ability to do miracles). God often calls us to do tasks that seem too difficult, but He doesn't ask us to do them alone. God also offers us His resources, just as He did to Moses. We should not hide behind our inadequacies, as Moses did, but look behind ourselves to the great resources available. Then we can allow God to use our unique contributions.
