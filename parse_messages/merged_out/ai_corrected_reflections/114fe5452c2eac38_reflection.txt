When we say, "Where there is no law, there is no sin," what we mean is, people cannot know their actions are sinful unless they have a law that forbids those actions. God's law makes people realize that they are sinners doomed to die, yet it offers no help. Sin is real, and it is dangerous. Imagine a sunny day at the beach. You plunge into the surf, then you notice a sign on the pier: "No swimming, sharks." Your day is ruined. Is it the sign's fault? Are you angry with the people who put it up? The law is like the sign. It is essential, and we are grateful for it—but it does not get rid of the sharks.
