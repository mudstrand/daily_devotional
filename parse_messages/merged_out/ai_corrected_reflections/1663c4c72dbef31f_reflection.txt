So what is the purpose of life? It is that we should fear the all-powerful God. To fear God means to respect and stand in awe of Him because of who He is. "Purpose" in life starts with whom we know, not with what we know or how good we are. It is impossible to fulfill our God-given purpose unless we revere God and give Him first place in our life.
