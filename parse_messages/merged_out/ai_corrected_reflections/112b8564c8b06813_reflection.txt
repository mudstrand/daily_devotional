Approving wrong identifies the one who approves with the ungodly. Those who do this give evidence of the law of sin that is at work within them. Defending sin, as the unregenerate defend their wrongdoing, is an indication of rebellion against God. The consequence is that rebellion brings the judgment of God, and the wrath of God will rest upon ungodliness. But repentant ones are willing to flee into the city of refuge, through the narrow gate, to be cleansed by the atoning blood of Christ.
