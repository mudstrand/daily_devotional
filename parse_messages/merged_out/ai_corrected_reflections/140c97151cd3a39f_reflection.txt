God gave us humans tremendous authority to be in charge of the whole earth. But with great authority comes great responsibility. If we own a pet, we have the legal authority to do with it as we wish, but we also have a responsibility to feed and care for it. How have you treated God's creation? Remember, we are to use our resources wisely because God holds us accountable as stewards.
