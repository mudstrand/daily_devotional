When I was young, I had to memorize these verses, but it became difficult for me to understand the third part of this verse because I thought loving myself a vain, prideful thing to do. In other words, not a Christian thing. But it was explained to me that it grieves God when we treat ourselves poorly, just as it would if we treated a brother or sister in Christ poorly. When you find yourself being too critical, negative, or demanding with yourself today, ask yourself: Is this how I would treat my best friend? [Then be kind to yourself.] Remember, Jesus loves you and wants you to love yourself too.
