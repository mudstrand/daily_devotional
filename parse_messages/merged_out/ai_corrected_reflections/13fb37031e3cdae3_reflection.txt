Many proverbs point out that the "bitter fruit of living their own way" will be the consequences people will experience in this life. We are faced with two choices—either choosing God's wisdom or persisting in rebellious independence, deciding to go it alone. Choosing the latter will create problems for people that will destroy them. Don't ignore God's advice—even if it is painful for the present. It will keep you from greater pain in the future.
