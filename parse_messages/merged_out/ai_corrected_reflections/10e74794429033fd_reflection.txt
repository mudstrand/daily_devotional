Throughout the trial, we see that Jesus was in control, not Pilate or the religious leaders. Throughout the trial, Pilate wavered in his opinion of Jesus; the Jewish leaders reacted out of hatred and anger, but Jesus remained composed. He knew the truth, He knew God's plan, and He knew the reason for His trial. Despite the pressure and the persecution, Jesus remained unmoved. It was really Pilate and the religious leaders who were on trial, not Jesus. If you are ever questioned or ridiculed because of your faith, remember that while you may be on trial before your accusers, they are on trial before God.
