Jesus mentions two kinds of people: "the wise and clever" - arrogant in their own knowledge - and the "childlike" - humbly open to receive the truth of God's Word. Are you wise in your own eyes, or do you seek the truth in childlike faith, realizing that only God holds all the answers? In the O.T., to "know" means more than knowledge. It means to have an intimate relationship.
