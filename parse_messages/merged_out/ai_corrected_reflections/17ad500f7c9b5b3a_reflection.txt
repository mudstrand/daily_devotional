When most people seek advice, they go to their friends first because friends accept them and usually agree with them. But that is why they may not be able to help them with difficult problems. Our friends are so much like us they may not have the answers we haven't already heard. Instead, we should seek out older, wiser people to advise us. Wise people have experienced a lot of life and have succeeded. They are not afraid to tell the truth. Seek out some wise, godly people who can warn you of the pitfalls ahead.
