These two men were secret followers of Jesus. They were afraid to make their allegiance known because of their positions in the Jewish community. Joseph was a leader and honored member of the Jewish high council. Nicodemus, also a member of the high council, had come to Jesus by night (John 3:1) and later tried to defend him before the other religious leaders (John 7:50-52). Yet they risked their reputations to provide for Jesus' burial. Are you a secret believer? Do you hide your faith from your friends and fellow workers? This is an appropriate time—just maybe your last chance—to step out of hiding and let others know whom you follow.
