Most generally, when the word "yeast" is used in the Bible, it is referring to sin or evil. A little yeast causes the whole lump of dough to rise, which means that it only takes one wrong person to infect all the others. This reminds me of what my uncle used to say, "You let the devil have your little finger, and he will take your whole hand." Sin is an infectious disease, so remember to always take a healthy dose of God's word each morning.
