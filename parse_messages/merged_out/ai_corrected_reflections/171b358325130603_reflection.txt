Now, as we face the battles that are common to everyone, I have found peace in the knowledge that He has everything under control. Every day of our life was written in His book even before we were born (Psalm 139:16). He knew us at our very beginning, and He is walking beside us as we face the middle of this life. We can trust He'll carry us through to a happy ending, and that will be the start of an even better story.
