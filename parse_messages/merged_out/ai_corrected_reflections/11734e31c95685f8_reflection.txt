Paul's says that both life and death are ours. While nonbelievers are victims of life, swept along by its current and wondering if there is any meaning to it, believers can use life well because they understand its true purpose. Nonbelievers can only fear death. For believers, however, death holds no terrors because Christ has conquered all fears (see 1 John 4:18). Death is only the beginning of eternal life with God.
