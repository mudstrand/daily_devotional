In Revelation 21, John received a vision of a different city—the New Jerusalem. If you will notice, he said less about its design and more about the character of those who were there. THINK OF IT: no more death! Nor will there be any more "crying or pain." All these things will be replaced by the wonderful presence of the God of the universe.
