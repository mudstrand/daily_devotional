Jesus's disciples were surrounded by a storm, and He used the experience to teach them about the power and faithfulness of God. (Matthew 8:23-27) We often seek answers for the uncertainties of life. Whether young or old, we all face uncertain futures. God's love and goodness encircle us no matter what waits for us. We wait and see what God will do.
