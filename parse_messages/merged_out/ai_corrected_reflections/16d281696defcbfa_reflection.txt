If you feel like treasure hunting, go back and review the Psalms. In doing this, you will discover the parallels of our journey through life. It begins with presenting us two roads: the way to life and the way to death. If we choose God's way to life, we will still face both blessings and troubles, joy and grief, success and obstacles. But throughout it all, God is at our side, guiding, encouraging, comforting, and caring. Knowing this should cause us to praise God for leading us in the right direction and for assuring us of a place in the perfect world He has in store for those who have faithfully followed Him.
