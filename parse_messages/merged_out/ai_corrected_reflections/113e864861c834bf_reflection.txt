Yes, one's speech is evidence of whether they walk with the Lord or not. Words from an ungodly person can be as poisonous as that of a rattler to their neighbor. Wicked people poison and destroy their neighbors by words expressing unbelief. Jesus said, "You brood of vipers! How can you speak good when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks." (Matthew 12:34)
