God wants to forgive sinners—forgiveness has always been a part of His loving nature. He announced this to Moses (Exodus 34:6, 7). He revealed it to David, and He dramatically showed it to the world through Jesus Christ. These verses convey several aspects of God's forgiveness. He forgives rebellion, puts sin out of sight, and clears our record of sin. Paul quoted these verses in Romans 4:7, 8 and showed that we can have the same joyous experience of forgiveness through faith in Jesus Christ.
