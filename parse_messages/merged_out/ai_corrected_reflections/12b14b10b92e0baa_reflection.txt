Preachers, teachers, and anyone else who talks about Jesus Christ must remember that they stand in God's presence. He hears every word. When you tell people about Christ, be careful not to distort the message to please your audience. Have you "renounced the hidden things of shame" in your life? If not, then renounce it as soon as it comes to mind. We must maintain continual watchfulness so that nothing arises in our life that would cause us shame.
