In the Christian life, we battle against the powerful evil forces of fallen angels headed by Satan. To withstand their attacks, we must depend on God's strength and use every piece of His armor. (Ephesians 6:10-17) Now, Paul is not giving counsel only to the church, but also to individuals within the church. The whole body needs to be armed. It is only by the Holy Spirit's power that we can be victorious.
