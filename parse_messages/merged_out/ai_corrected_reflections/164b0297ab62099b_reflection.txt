This verse can be understood to mean that the final outcome of our plans that we make are in God's hands. So then the question is, "Why make plans?" Well, in doing God's will, there must be a partnership between our efforts and God's control. He wants us to use our minds, to seek the advice of others, in our plans. As you live for Him, ask for guidance as you plan, and then act on your plans; you need to trust in Him.
