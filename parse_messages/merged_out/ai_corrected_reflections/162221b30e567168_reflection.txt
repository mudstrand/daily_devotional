God is more than willing to pour out His heart and make known His thoughts to us. To receive His advice, we must be willing to listen, refusing to let pride stand in our way. Pride is thinking more highly of our own wisdom and desires than God's. If we think we know better than God or feel we have no need of God's direction, we have fallen into foolish and disastrous pride.
