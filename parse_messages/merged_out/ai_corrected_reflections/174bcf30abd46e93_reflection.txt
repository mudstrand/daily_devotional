The wicked Babylonians trusted in themselves and would fall, but the righteous live by their faith and trust in God. This verse has inspired countless Christians. Paul quotes it in Romans 1:17, and in Galatians 3:11. The writer of Hebrews quotes it in 10:38, just before the chapter on faith. And it is helpful to all Christians who must live through difficult times without seeing signs of hope. Christians must trust that God is directing all things according to His purpose.
