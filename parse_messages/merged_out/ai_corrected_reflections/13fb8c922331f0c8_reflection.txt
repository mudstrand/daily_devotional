Just think of what the disciples had learned to know the power of Christ Jesus here on earth. And yet that was just a little thing as compared with the greater works that He was now to do in and through them. He has the power to work even in the feeblest of His servants with the strength of the Almighty God. He has power even to use their apparent weakness to carry out His purposes. He has the power over every enemy and every human heart, over every difficulty and danger. But let us remember that this power is never meant to be experienced as if it were our own.
