It was against God's law to leave the body of a dead person exposed overnight (see Deuteronomy 21:23), and it was also against the law to work after sundown on Friday, when the Sabbath began. This is why the religious leaders urgently wanted to get Jesus' body down off the cross and buried by sundown. Now these Roman soldiers had lots of experience from many previous crucifixions, so they knew when a man was dead or alive. So they did not need to break His legs. The reason for the breaking of the legs was so they could not hold themselves up, because when they could no longer hold themselves up, death came by suffocation in just minutes. Jesus went through this ordeal so that our sins would be paid in full--that is why He said, "It is finished." There was no longer any need for the sacrifice of animals or anything else. Jesus' shed blood was sufficient for all time.
