This proverb refers to preparing for battle. All our preparation for any task is useless without God. But even with God's help, we must do our part and prepare. His control of the outcome does not nullify our responsibilities. God may want you to produce a great book, but you must learn to write. God may want to use you in foreign missions, but you must learn the language. God will accomplish His purpose, and He will use you if you have done your part by being well prepared.
