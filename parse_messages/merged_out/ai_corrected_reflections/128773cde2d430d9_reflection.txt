Christians have differing gifts, abilities, experience, and maturity. God doesn't expect us all to be and act the same, but He does expect us to "hold on" to what we have, to persevere in using our resources for Him. If you are a new believer and feel your faith and spiritual strength are little, use what you have to live for Christ, and God will commend you. If you want to hang on to the crown, you need to hang on to God's Word through which His Spirit strengthens the grip of faith.
