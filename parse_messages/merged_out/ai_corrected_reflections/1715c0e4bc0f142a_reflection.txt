Apart from what Jesus has done, the thought of aging and dying would be overwhelming. Jesus' words show that the way to eternal life is secure—that is as secure as your trust in Jesus. He has already prepared the way to eternal life. The only issue that may still be unsettled is your willingness to believe. Jesus has promised it to all who believe in Him. Although the details of eternity are unknown, we need not fear because Jesus is preparing for us and will spend eternity with us.
