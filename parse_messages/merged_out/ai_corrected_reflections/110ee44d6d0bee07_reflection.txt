Because Jesus did die once for all, He brought the sacrificial system to an end. He forgave sins, past, present, and future. The Jews did not need to go back to the old system because Christ, the perfect sacrifice, completed the work of redemption. You don't have to look for another way to have your sins forgiven, Christ was, and still is, the final sacrifice for you.
