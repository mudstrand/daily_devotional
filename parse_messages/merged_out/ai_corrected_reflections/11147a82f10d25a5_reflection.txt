If we truly stop and think about it, we have significant privileges associated with our new life in Christ: (1) We have personal access to God through Christ and can draw near to Him without an elaborate system (Hebrews 10:22). (2) We may grow in faith, overcome doubts and questions, and deepen our relationship with God (Hebrews 10:23). (3) We may enjoy encouragement from one another (Hebrews 10:24). (4) We may worship together (Hebrews 10:25). Let us not overlook or forsake these privileges.
