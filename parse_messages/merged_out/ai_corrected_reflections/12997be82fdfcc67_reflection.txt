"They are all gone," the psalmist tells me. "God has hurled them into the depths of the sea." Jesus came to wrap all those sins into one gigantic ball, load it on the barge of His love, and dump it into the deepest part of the ocean. What a picture! God has paid for my sins with the blood of His Son. He's put them totally out of sight as if they never happened. Where do they go? Into the depths of the sea, where God no longer sees them and where He places the sign "No fishing allowed," that means I am to leave them alone too.
