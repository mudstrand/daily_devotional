We have here a tenfold inventory of superhuman realities that threaten, in vain, to break the grip of Christ's love. These unseen cosmic forces, even though created by God, now stand in opposition to God's eternal purpose because of the fall. They even threaten to separate us from Christ's love, but Christ has triumphed over them. Christ's death, resurrection, and exaltation at God's right hand guarantees victory over anything and everything that would separate us from His love. When following Christ brings distress, we sometimes distance ourselves from Him. But Christ never draws back from us.
