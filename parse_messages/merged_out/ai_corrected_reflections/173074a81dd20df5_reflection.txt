Would you change the way you live if you knew that every word and thought would be examined by God first? David asks that God approve his words and thoughts as though they were offerings brought to the altar. As you begin each day, pray that God's love will guide what you say and what you think. Father, let the words of my mouth (or even an email) be used to encourage others.
