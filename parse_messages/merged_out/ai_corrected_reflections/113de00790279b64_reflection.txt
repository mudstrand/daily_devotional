Each and every member of the human race is guilty before God; and without redemption, eternal death is certain. This is truly expressed in Psalm 14:2, 3: "The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there are any that act wisely, that seek after God. They have all gone astray, they are all alike corrupt; there is none that does good, no, not one." Regardless of the pain caused by this teaching, we have to admit that it is God's explanation of our circumstance. We are guilty before Him. Yes, we must be justified and sanctified while we live this life, or we will be eternally lost. God, help us to understand this.
