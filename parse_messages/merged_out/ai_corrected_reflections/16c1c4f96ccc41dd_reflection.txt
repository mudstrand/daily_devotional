We live in a noisy world. Today, right? I live next to a highway, and I couldn't even guess how many trucks and cars come into town or pass through town on this highway. But there are days we need to close the patio door just to hear ourselves think. It is sad, but often our church sanctuaries are so noisy that it leaves little time for quiet reflection. The Psalmist's words are still relevant today: "Wait silently for God alone." (Psalm 62:5) The trick today is to find that place of silence. Why? Because we need silence to hear God's voice, so we need to turn down the world's volume.
