When you feel down, you may find it difficult to give thanks. That is when we need to remember the promise found in (Romans 8:28), "In all things God works for our good if we love Him and are called by Him." Before we can be thankful, it's a good idea to take inventory of what God has given us. Where do we start? Where better than at the cross? Thank God not for your problems but for the strength He is building in you through the difficult experiences of your life. You can be sure that God will see you through. Yes, in Jesus' name, I can be thankful for everything.
