What is truly interesting is the fact that God has taken a personal interest in us. That is truly fascinating when you think about the universe He created. The earth has a perfect amount of oxygen and nitrogen to sustain mankind. There are many other facts about the universe that I don't have the room to explain that make man seem quite insignificant, yet God had such a love for us that He sent His own Son to die for our sins. YES, ALL CREATION IS AN OUTSTRETCHED FINGER POINTING TOWARD GOD.
