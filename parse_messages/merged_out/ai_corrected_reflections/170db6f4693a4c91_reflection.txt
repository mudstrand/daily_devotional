Everything changes when we regard Jesus as our shepherd. He protects, guides, and provides for us. Knowing that, we don't need to fend for ourselves, which floods us with a sense of security, thus we find peace. Read Psalm 23 as a prayer to Jesus. Verses one and two might sound like this: "Jesus, you're my Shepherd and provide everything I need. Thanks for letting me rest in green meadows and leading me beside peaceful streams."
