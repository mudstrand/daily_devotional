Our heart, our feelings of love and desire, dictate to a great extent how we live, because we always find time to do what we enjoy. Solomon tells us to guard our heart above all else, making sure we concentrate on those desires that will keep us on the right path. Make sure your affection leads you in the right direction. Put boundaries on your desires. Don't go after everything you see. Look straight ahead, keep your eyes fixed on your goal, and don't get sidetracked on detours that lead to sin.
