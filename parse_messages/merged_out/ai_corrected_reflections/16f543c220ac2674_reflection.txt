Some Thoughts to Remember: 1. Remember that this may be the day the Lord returns. (Psalm 118:24) 2. Use time wisely, make the most of every opportunity. (Colossians 4:5) 3. Treat everyone as if you'll never see them again. (Acts 10:37, 38) If we truly believe now is all the time we have, what a difference that will make in our lives. It's great to be a part of the family of God.
