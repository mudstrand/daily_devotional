How do I know that Christ has risen? What proof have I to give? He touched my life one blessed day, And I began to live. How do I know He left the tomb That morning long ago? I met him just this morning, And my heart is still aglow. How do I know that endless life He gained for me that day? His life within is proof enough Of immortality. How do I know that Christ still lives, Rich blessing to impart? He walks with me along the way And lives within my heart.
