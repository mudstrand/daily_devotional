Since COVID took over our country, and the challenges about the election being a farce, the country has been in turmoil, and we even hear that our democracy is being threatened. Let us put to memory . . . "The Lord your God will be with you wherever you go." Only He can give us the courage to face life and death. May we be moved to call upon His power and promises daily.
