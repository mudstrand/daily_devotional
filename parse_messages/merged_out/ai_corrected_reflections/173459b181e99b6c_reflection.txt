Does Paul's reference to the "last days" sound like the times we are living in? Paul reveals his sense of our urgency. The last day began after Jesus' resurrection when the Holy Spirit came upon the believers at Pentecost. The "last days" will continue until Christ's second coming. This means that we are living in the last days. So we should make the most of the time that God has given us. (Ephesians 5:16)
