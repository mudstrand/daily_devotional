In verses 1-8 we see the believers receiving a seal to protect them through a time of great tribulation and suffering. In verses 9-17 we see the believers finally with God in heaven. All who have been faithful through the ages, they are singing before God's throne. Their tribulations and sorrows are over: no more tears for sin, for all sins are forgiven; no more tears for suffering, for all suffering is over; no more tears for death, for all believers have been resurrected to die no more. So let us stay on the path of the Lord and follow Him.
