"Taste and see" does not mean, "Check out God's credentials." Instead, it is an invitation: "Try this, I know you will like it." When we take that first step of obedience in following God, we cannot help discovering that He is good and kind. When we begin the Christian life, our knowledge of God is incomplete. But as we trust Him more each day, we will experience how good He truly is.
