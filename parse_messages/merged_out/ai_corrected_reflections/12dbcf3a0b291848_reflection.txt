All Christians have the Holy Spirit, not just a select few. They follow the Spirit's leading by gently and humbly caring for one who lapses into sin. Even though we have sins, the grace of the Holy Spirit does not allow them to harm us. In the Christian church, there is (continuous, uninterrupted) forgiveness of sin. Never, ever underestimate the working of the Holy Spirit.
