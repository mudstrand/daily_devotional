Have you ever thought about the great exchange? Well, when we trust in Christ, we make an exchange; He takes our sins and makes us right with God. Yes, our sin was laid on Him at His crucifixion. His righteousness is given to us at our conversion. This is what Christians mean by Christ's atonement for sin. In the world, bartering works only when two people exchange goods of like value. But God offers to trade His righteousness for our sin—something of immeasurable worth for something completely worthless. How grateful we should be for His kindness to us.
