Mary was merely doing what we are all called to do in (Psalm 34:2, 3). 2 I will glory in the LORD; let the afflicted hear and rejoice. 3 Glorify the LORD with me; let us exalt his name together.

But God puts a higher priority on knowing Him personally and living a life that reflects His justice and righteousness. What do you want people to admire most about you?
