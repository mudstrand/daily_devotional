Yes, we have remarkable evidence of God's design throughout creation, telling us of a God of order, design, and greatness. Now, what is even more amazing is the fact that God has taken a personal interest in us. Yes, God cared so much that He sent His own Son to die for us. This great Creator became our Savior. ALL CREATION IS AN OUTSTRETCHED FINGER POINTING TOWARD GOD.
