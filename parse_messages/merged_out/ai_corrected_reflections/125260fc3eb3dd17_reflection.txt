As we gather around our Thanksgiving tables this year, I believe that we would have to say, "I cannot begin to count the blessings I have received this year." Grace sufficient, help and healing, prayer often answered at my call; and best of all my blessings, Christ Himself, my all in all. While we love to "count the blessings," grateful for the year that's gone, faith would sweep a wider vision, hope would look yet further on. For the signals all around us seem to say as one, "Christ is coming soon to bring Earth's last, best Thanksgiving Day!"
