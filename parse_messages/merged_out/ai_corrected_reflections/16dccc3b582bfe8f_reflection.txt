How wonderful it is that the Lord Jesus has met our greatest needs: our salvation, forgiveness, new life, and peace with God! We are well supplied with food for our souls conveyed to us through the means of grace. We have spiritual clothing: the robe of Christ's righteousness imparted by faith. Truly, as Paul said, "Godliness with contentment is great gain" (1 Timothy 6:6).
