What a difference it makes to know Jesus! He cares for us in spite of what the world thinks. Christians don't have to give in to public opinion and pressure. Paul stood faithful to God whether people praised him or slandered him. He remained joyous and content in the most difficult hardships. We should not let circumstances or people's expectations control us. We need to be firm as we stand true to God and refuse to compromise His standards for living.
