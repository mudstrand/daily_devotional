Many of our garden seeds, when we have planted them, if they are truly cared for, they send their roots down deep. They go down deep into the good soil, likewise the Word takes root and grows to bear fruit. It's like they are stubborn about it. And apparently, the fruit doesn't always come fast and easy. It takes patient endurance. This means we may fall down, but we get back up. We may doubt, but we refuse to give up our faith. We get tired, but we keep fighting the good fight. Draw a picture of what speaks to you about this parable. Then, hang it on your fridge to remind you to tend your heart's garden and water it with faith.
