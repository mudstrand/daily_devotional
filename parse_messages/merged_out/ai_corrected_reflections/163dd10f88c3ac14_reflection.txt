Needless to say, death for many is a darkened door at the end of life, a passageway to an unknown destiny. But for God's people, death is a bright pathway to a new and better life. So, friends, why do we fear death? Is it fear of pain we expect, the separation from loved ones, or the unknown? God can help us with those fears. He has shown us that death is not final but just another step in the eternal life we received when we follow Him.
