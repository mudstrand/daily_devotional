We often receive special blessings from our grandchildren, which in many cases are like the blessing Jesus sends us. When we open our Bibles, words may jump off the page that are exactly what we need to hear. A song may open our heart and stir us to worship. A friend may call or text or email with an encouraging note. In either of these cases, we should recognize that Jesus is pouring out His love to us. This is His compassion, acknowledging our hurt, which will never belittle us. His tenderness helps us receive His grace, and His strength empowers us to endure and offer His comfort to others.
