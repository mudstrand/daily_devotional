When James and John were rejected by the Samaritan village, they didn't want to stop at shaking the dust off their feet (Luke 9:5). They wanted to retaliate by calling down fire from heaven on the people, as Elijah did on the servants of a wicked king of Israel (2 Kg. 1). When others reject or scorn us, we, too, may feel like retaliating. But let us remember that judgment belongs to God. We must not expect Him to use His power to carry out our personal vendettas.
