Although we are not in a position to barter with God, He may still choose to answer a prayer that has a promise. When you pray, ask yourself, 'Will I follow through on any promises I make to God if He grants my request?' It is dangerous to ignore a promise, especially to God. God keeps His promises, and He expects you to keep yours.
