God calls His people to be morally upright, and in the five verses of this psalm, He gives us 10 standards. I suggest that you read them. If you have read them, do you have the kind of rock-solid integrity that can stand the test of living honestly day by day? David said that if we do, we will "never be shaken." (15:5)
