Once again, Jesus offers hope. The Holy Spirit gives strength to endure the unreasonable hatred and evil in our world and the hostility many have toward Christ. This is especially comforting for those facing persecution. Jesus uses two names for the Holy Spirit: "Counselor" and "Spirit of Truth." The word "Counselor" conveys the helping, encouraging, and strengthening work of the Spirit. "Spirit of Truth" points to the teaching, illuminating, and reminding work of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit ministers to both the head and the heart, and both are equally important.
