If you read all six verses of Chapter 12, you will notice it's all a hymn of praise. What is the praise about? It is a description of the people's joy when Jesus Christ comes to reign over the earth. Even now, we need to express our gratitude to God, thanking Him and telling others about Him. Yes, from the depths of our gratitude, we need to be praising Him. And we should share the Good News with others. The Good News of how God turned His anger away and sent His Son to be our salvation, that is truly a reason for joy.
