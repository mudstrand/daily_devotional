Did you notice that James did not say "if trouble comes your way" but "whenever it does"? Like James, I think we agree from experience that trouble is inevitable. So what do we do when they do come? I believe what James is saying in vs. 3 is that we can profit from them, because they can produce perseverance, and who does not need perseverance? Now the point is not to pretend to be happy when we face pain, but to have a positive outlook. Let us use troubles as a learning experience, because tough times can teach us perseverance.
