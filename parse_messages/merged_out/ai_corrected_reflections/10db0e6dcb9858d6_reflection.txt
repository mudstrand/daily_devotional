Too often, "fruit bearing" is mistaken for merely soul winning, but there is much more that is found in this term. In this chapter, prayer, joy, and love are mentioned as fruit. There are other fruits mentioned in Galatians 5:22-24 and II Peter 1:5-8. "Remaining in Christ" means (1) believing that He is God's Son (I John 4:15), (2) receiving Him as Savior and Lord (John 1:12), (3) doing what God says (I John 3:24), (4) continuing to believe the Good News (I John 2:24), and (5) relating in love to the community of believers, Christ's body (John 15:12). Keep this list close at hand to see how you fare, and to see where you need improvement.
