The successful life prescribed by Christ requires faithfulness until death: a hand on the plow with no looking back, steadfast perseverance; racing hard for the tape, fighting the good fight of faith. The devil loves it when we simply relax our efforts. A secret for success is: "fight just one more round. Be brave for five more minutes." It is the difference between defeat and victory.
