Apparently, some were teaching that keeping the Old Testament ceremonial laws and rituals (such as not eating certain foods) was important for salvation. But these laws were useless for conquering a person's evil thoughts and desires (Colossians 2:23). Laws can influence conduct, but they cannot change the heart. Lasting changes in conduct begin when the Holy Spirit lives in each person.
