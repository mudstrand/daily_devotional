Jesus is like us because He experienced a full range of temptations throughout His life as a human being. We can be comforted in knowing that Jesus faced temptation, and so He can sympathize with us. We can be encouraged knowing that Jesus faced temptation without giving in to sin. He shows us that we do not have to sin when facing the seductive lure of temptation. Jesus is the only perfect human being who has ever lived.
