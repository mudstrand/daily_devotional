The magic of a thankful spirit is that it has the power to replace: Anger with love. Resentment with happiness. Fear with faith. Worry with peace. The desire to dominate with the wish to play on a team. Self-preoccupation with concern for the needs of others. Guilt with an open door to forgiveness. Jealousy with joy at another's success. Lack of creativity with inspired productivity. Inferiority with dignity. A lack of love with an abundance of self-sharing. When we feel down, we may find it hard to give thanks. But we can take heart, because in all things God works for the good of those who love Him. We don't need to thank God for our problems, but for the strength He is building in us through the difficult experiences of our life. We can be sure that God's perfect love will see us through.
