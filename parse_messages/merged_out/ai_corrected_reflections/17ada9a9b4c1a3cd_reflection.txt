The poor are often victims of an unjust society. A poor man's soil may be good, but unjust laws may rob him of his own produce. This proverb does not take lightly or wink at injustice, it simply describes what often occurs. We should do what we can to fight injustice of every sort. Our efforts may seem inadequate, but it is comforting to know that in the end God's justice will prevail.
