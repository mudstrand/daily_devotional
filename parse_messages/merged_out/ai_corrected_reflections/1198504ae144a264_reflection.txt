Paul contrasts the glory of the 10 Commandments with the glory of the new covenant. If the Law that leads to death was glorious, how much more glorious is God's plan which gives us life through the Spirit. Paul says, if the old covenant had its glory (and it certainly did), just imagine how glorious the new covenant is. The law was wonderful because, even though it condemned us, it pointed us to Christ. But in the New Covenant, the law and the promise are fulfilled. By grace, and faith in Christ's finished work, we can be made right with God!
