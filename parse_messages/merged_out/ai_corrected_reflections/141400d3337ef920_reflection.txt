Oh, yes, we need not fear. God cares about the helpless. Here, we see that He promises to rescue the helpless and confront their oppressors. Shouldn't we identify with God's attitude? His work is not done until we care for the needs of the poor. Let us remember to have faith in God's timing, but let us also be faithful in fulfilling our part in the care of those less fortunate.
