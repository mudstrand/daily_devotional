When we are truly broken over our sins, God lovingly puts us back together. "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness." (1 John 1:9) Humility is the right response to God's holiness, and praise is our heart's response to His forgiveness.
