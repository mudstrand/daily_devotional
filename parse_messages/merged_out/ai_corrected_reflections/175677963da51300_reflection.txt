How much we love God can be measured by how well we treat others. Jesus' example of giving a cup of cold water to a thirsty child is a good model of unselfish service. A child can't or won't return a favor. God notices every good deed we do or don't do as if He were the one receiving it. Is there something unselfish you can do for someone else today? Although no one else may see you, God will notice.
