God's gifts vary in nature, power, and effectiveness according to His wisdom and graciousness, not according to our faith. God will give the special power necessary and appropriate to carry out each responsibility. We cannot, by our own effort or willpower, drum up more ability and so be more effective teachers or servants. These are God's gifts to His church, and He gives faith and power as He wills. Our role is to be faithful and to seek ways to serve others with what Christ has given us. When you identify your own gifts (and this list is far from complete), ask how you can use them to build up God's family. At the same time, realize that your gifts can't do the work of the church all alone. Be thankful for people whose gifts are completely different from yours. Let your strengths balance their weaknesses, and be grateful that their abilities make up for your deficiencies. Together you can build Christ's church.
