God lights our path when we trust Jesus as our Savior. This trust may come through a word of exhortation from a fellow believer. It may be the illumination of God's Word by the ministry of the Holy Spirit. It may be the calm reassurance in response to heartfelt prayer. Or it may be the miraculous supply of a special need. Whatever the case, God sends light when we are engulfed in darkness. Jesus lights the way in the darkest night.
