The number of David's opponents meant nothing as long as he was on the Lord's side. Victory is "not by force nor by strength, but by the Spirit," says the Lord Almighty. Are you on the Lord's side? You may never face an enemy army, but the battles you face every day can be won with the Lord's strength.
