We have the example of Jesus, who guarded His tongue, especially during His trial: "When they hurled their insults at Him, He did not retaliate; when He suffered, He made no threats" (1 Peter 2:23). When the truth was at stake, however, He readily testified before the Sanhedrin and before Pontius Pilate. The example of Jesus would be of little benefit if we didn't have the motivation and might to use our tongues aright. Thank God that the Holy Spirit gives us this desire through our faith in Jesus' redeeming merit.
