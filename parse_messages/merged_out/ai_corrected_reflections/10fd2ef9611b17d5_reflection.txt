Yes, God has put Jesus in charge of everything, and Jesus revealed Himself to us. We do not see Jesus reigning on earth as of yet, but we can picture Him in His heavenly glory. When you are confused by present events and anxious about the future, remember Jesus' true position and authority. He is Lord of all, and one day He will rule on earth as He now does in heaven. This truth can give stability to your decisions day by day.
