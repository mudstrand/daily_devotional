"Because Jesus Himself suffered when He was tempted, He is able to help those who are being tempted." (Vs. 18) The Lord could have avoided the cross. Instead, He obeyed His Father. Through His death, He broke the power of Satan and freed us from our fear of death. (Vss. 14-15) In every temptation, Jesus walks beside us to give us courage, strength, and hope along the way.
