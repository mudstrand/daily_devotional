By faith, many Christians have experienced this to be true. Hebrews 11 is a detailed report on what God's people accomplished because they trusted in God. Despite human weakness, they prevailed in very difficult circumstances. God's strength is still ours. In fact, the more we let God take over when we have problems, the more we succeed. When it comes to salvation, we depend entirely on God. St. Paul's words are an appropriate theme for our lives: When we rely on Christ, we are truly strong.
