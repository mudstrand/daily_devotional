Our one tongue has a lot more potential than most of us will ever put to use. A tongue devoted to God can accomplish much. Have you ever become discouraged, thinking that you have little to offer God? If you have Christ's love in your heart and a willing tongue in your mouth, you can offer them boldly to God today and begin to bring praise and honor to the Lord. Remember that little is much when God is in it!
