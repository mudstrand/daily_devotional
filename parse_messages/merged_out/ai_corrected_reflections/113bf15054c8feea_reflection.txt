Yes, the Jews were recipients of God's message concerning man's greatest and most urgent need. We need to remember that the Scriptures are identified as the revealed Word of God. What are the words of God? They are the messages recorded in the O.T. from God to His people. They include the holy commandments, the promises of a coming Savior, and the revelation given concerning the way of salvation. The psalmist wrote it like this: "He declares His word to Jacob, His statutes and ordinances to Israel. He has not dealt thus with any other nation." (Psalm 147:19-20)
