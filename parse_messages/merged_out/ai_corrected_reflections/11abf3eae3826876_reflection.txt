The Corinthians were called to examine and test themselves to see if they were really Christians. Just as we get physical check-ups, Paul urges us to give ourselves spiritual check-ups. We should look for a growing awareness of Christ's presence and power in our life. We need this check-up to see if we are true Christians or merely impostors. If we are not actively seeking to grow closer to God, we are drawing farther away from Him.
