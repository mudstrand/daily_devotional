"Our hearts are open to you" means that Paul had told the Corinthian believers his true feelings for them, he had told them clearly how much he loved them. The Corinthians were reacting coldly to Paul's words, but Paul explained that his harsh words came from his love for them. It is easy to react against whom God has placed over us in leadership rather than to accept their advice as a sign of their love for us. We need an open rather than a closed heart toward God's message.
