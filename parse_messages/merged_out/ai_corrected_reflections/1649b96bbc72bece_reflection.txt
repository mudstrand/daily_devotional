People with tunnel vision, those who are locked into one way of thinking, are likely to miss the right road because they have closed their minds to any new options. We need the help of those who can enlarge our vision and broaden our perspective. We need to seek out the advice of those who know us and have a wealth of experience. We need a network of advisors. We also need to open our minds to new ideas and be willing to weigh their suggestions carefully.
