If you are a worrier, there is hope for you! When you think about a problem over and over in your mind, that's called worry. When you think about God's Word over and over in your mind, that's meditation. If you know how to worry, you already know how to meditate! The more we meditate on God's Word, the less we need to worry. God uses those who can honestly say, "The Lord is my shepherd."
