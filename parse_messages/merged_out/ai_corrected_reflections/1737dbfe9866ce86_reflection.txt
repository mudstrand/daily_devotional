We have significant privileges associated with our new life in Christ: (1) We have personal access to God through Christ and can draw near to Him without an elaborate system (10:22); (2) we grow in faith, overcome doubts and questions, and deepen our relationship with God (10:23); (3) we may enjoy encouragement from one another (10:24); (4) we may worship together (10:25).
