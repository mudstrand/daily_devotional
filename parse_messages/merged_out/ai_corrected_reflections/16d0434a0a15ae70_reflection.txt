David was losing hope, caught in paralyzing fear and deep depression. During times, we too may feel like we are caught in paralyzing fear and deep depression, and we are unable to pull ourselves out. At those times, we can come to the Lord and, like David, express our true feelings. Then, we will find help as we remember His works (143:5), reach out to Him in prayer (143:6), trust Him (143:8), and seek to do His will (143:10).
