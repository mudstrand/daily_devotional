The law was never meant to save people, but to point out sin (Romans 3:20; 5:20) and to point toward Christ (as we see by Galatians 3:24, 25). Salvation comes through Christ, whose sacrifice brings forgiveness of our sins. Being ethical, working diligently to help others, and giving to charitable causes are all commendable, but all of our good deeds cannot save us or make us right with God. There is a "better hope."
