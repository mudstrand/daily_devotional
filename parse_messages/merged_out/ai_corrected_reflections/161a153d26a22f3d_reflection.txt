Our life should be characterized by moral purity, patience, and peacefulness, so that we will "shine brightly" in a dark and depraved world. A transformed life is an effective witness to the power of God's Word. The question we need to ask ourselves is, "Is my life shining brightly, or is it clouded by complaining?" Let us shine out for God.
