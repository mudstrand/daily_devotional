The corrected text is: Many churches contain people who do not yet believe. Some are moving in the direction of belief, and others are simply pretending. Imposters, however, are not to be removed, for that is the Lord's work. The good news about Jesus Christ will save us if we firmly believe it and faithfully follow it.
