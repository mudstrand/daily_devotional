To "let there be harmony" or to allow no "divisions" and to "be of one mind, united in thought and purpose" does not require everyone to believe exactly the same. There is a difference between having opposing viewpoints and being divisive. It is very seldom that a group of people will completely agree on every issue, but we can still work together harmoniously if we agree on what truly matters — Jesus Christ is Lord of all. In your church, speak and behave in a way that will reduce arguments and increase harmony. Petty differences should never divide Christians.
