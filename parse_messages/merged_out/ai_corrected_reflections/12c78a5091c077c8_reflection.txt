Sin, sin, sin. There is no end to the ways it tries to enslave us, control us, dominate us, and attempts to dictate our actions. But Jesus can free you from this slavery that keeps you from becoming the person God created you to be. If sin is restraining, mastering, or enslaving you, Jesus can break its power over you. Jesus said, "Come to Me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest." (Matthew 11:28) Yes, sin can become a burden.
