The implication of these questions is that no one has fully understood the mind of the Lord. No one has been His counselor. And God owes nothing to anyone of us. Isaiah and Jeremiah asked similar questions to show that we are unable to give advice to God or criticize His ways (Isaiah 40:13; Jeremiah 23:18). God alone is the possessor of absolute power and absolute wisdom.
