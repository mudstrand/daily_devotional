God compared His love for His people with a mother's love for her child. When we are distressed or disillusioned, we may feel abandoned by society, family, and friends, but God does not abandon us. It is an encouragement that the Lord says, "I have engraved you on the palms of my hands." (vs. 16) to indicate how much He knows and protects us. Even if people forsake us, God will never forsake His own.
