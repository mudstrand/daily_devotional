God reconciles or brings us back to Himself, by blotting out our sins and making us right with Him. When we trust in Christ, we are no longer God's enemies or strangers or foreigners to Him. Because we have been reconciled to God, we have the privilege of encouraging others to do the same. As an ambassador, believers have the task of reconciling people to Him. We have been called or sent with His message of reconciliation to the world. How well are you fulfilling your commission as Christ's ambassador?
