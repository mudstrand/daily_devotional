The description of the Jews in that day portrays a picture of conditions as they are today. Nominal Christians have knowledge of the Bible and may even teach others, but many of them do not live consistently with their profession. This gives others a pretext for ridiculing God's Word. No religious exercise or sacramental observance will be of any use before God without a true inner life. So as is written in (John 3:3), "Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the Kingdom of God."
