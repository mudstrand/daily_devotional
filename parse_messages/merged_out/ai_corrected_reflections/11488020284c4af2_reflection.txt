What we need to realize first of all is that God is holy, and He will not be associated with sin. All people are sinful, and so they are separated from God. In addition, all sin deserves punishment. But instead of punishing us with the death we deserve, Christ took our sins upon Himself and took our punishment by dying on the cross. So now we can rejoice in God. Through faith in Christ's work, we become close to God (friends) rather than being enemies and outcasts.
