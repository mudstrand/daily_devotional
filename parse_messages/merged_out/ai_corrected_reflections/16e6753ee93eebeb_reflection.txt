Paul urges us to adopt practices of living that are in harmony with the Creator's will. The strength and clarity of this exhortation reminds us that we often set our minds on those things that are contrary to God's will. Paul's exhortations are always followed by promises of God's blessings on our behalf. So remember that a prayer without thanksgiving is an unfinished prayer.
