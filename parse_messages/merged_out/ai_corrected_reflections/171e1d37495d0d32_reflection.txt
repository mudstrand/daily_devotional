God used many approaches to send His messages to people in the Old T. times. Jewish people familiar with this would not have found it hard to believe that God was still revealing His will, but it was astonishing for them to think that God had revealed Himself by speaking through His Son, Jesus Christ. Jesus has been the fulfillment and culmination of God's revelation through the centuries. When we know Him, we have all we need to be saved from our sin and to have a perfect relationship with God.
