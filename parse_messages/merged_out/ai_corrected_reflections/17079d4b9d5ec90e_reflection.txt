Many sincere seekers were wondering what God wanted them to do. Many of the religions of the world are mankind's attempts to answer this question. But Jesus's reply is brief and simple. We must believe in Him whom God has sent. Remember that satisfying God does not come from the works we do, but in whom we believe. The first step is accepting that Jesus is who He claims to be. All spiritual development is built on this affirmation. Now it's up to you to declare to Jesus, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God."
