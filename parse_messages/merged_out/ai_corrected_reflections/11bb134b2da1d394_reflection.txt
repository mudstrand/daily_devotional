We have heard this statement over and over, but as humans we need this reminder: "We are saved by faith, not by deeds." Love for God and for others should be the response of those whom God has forgiven. God's forgiveness is complete, and Jesus said that "Those who are forgiven much love much" (Luke 7:47). The reason being is that faith expresses itself through love. You can check your love for others as a way to monitor your faith.
