It is often said that the OT is revealed in the NT, while the NT is concealed in the OT. In other words, what is not entirely clear in the OT becomes clear in the coming of Jesus the Christ. That is what has happened in Proverbs 8. The NT explicitly states that Jesus is the one "In whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge." (Colossians 2:3)
