Jesus devoted a substantial section of His Sermon on the Mount to money and the fondness of it. He taught us to pray not for an accumulation of riches but for "Our daily bread" (Matthew 6:11). Yes, He warned against storing up treasures on earth. True, money matters, but money shouldn't rule our decision-making process. Tough times and big decisions are opportunities to grow our faith in new ways. But never forget our Heavenly Father's love and cares for us.
