The writer of Psalm 102 knew the importance of prayer. He knew that God cares for us and wants to hear from us, so start something new and take at least five minutes each morning asking for His blessings on the day. The Lord wants to hear from you in your distress. Your new rule just may have a big impact on your family or someone close to you. (Remember, prayer is an acknowledgment of our need for God.)
