We see that the King Joash enjoyed a season of fruitfulness only while under the spiritual counsel of a godly priest. This makes us wonder what our legacies will be. Will we continue to grow and develop in our faith throughout our lives, producing fruit? Or will we become distracted by the things of this world and turn to modern-day idols such as comfort, materialism, and self-promotion? Living well and doing right requires perseverance and spiritual direction.
