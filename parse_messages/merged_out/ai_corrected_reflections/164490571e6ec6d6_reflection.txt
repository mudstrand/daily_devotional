We all know mockers (people who seem to have nothing better to do but ridicule people who have done a little bit better than themselves). The reason they do not find wisdom is they do not seek it seriously. Wisdom comes to those who apply God's Word to their lives and seek out godly counselors. If the wisdom you seek does not come easily to you, perhaps your attitude is the barrier.
