I am so grateful that Jesus cared about me enough to save me. He willingly gave His life for mine. And it does not matter what anyone else thinks. Sometimes I get so discouraged about things in my life or choices I've made that I don't feel worthy of anything. But then I remember that Paul said in Philippians 1:6 that I should be confident in the knowledge that Jesus will complete the work that He has started in me. We all face moments when we feel unworthy. Today, meditate on Philippians 1:6 and remember that Jesus isn't finished with you! You are worthy in His eyes.
