Jesus said to the disciples that the Holy Spirit would tell them "about the future," the nature of their mission, the opposition they would face, and the final outcome of their efforts. They did not fully understand these predictions until the Holy Spirit came after Jesus' death and resurrection. The Holy Spirit revealed truths to the disciples that they wrote down in the books that are now the New Testament. The truth into which the Holy Spirit guides us is the truth about Christ. The Spirit also helps us, through patient practice, to discern right from wrong.
