Jesus had no time for sin. Why? Because sin has a way of enslaving us, controlling us, dominating us, and dictating our actions. So what is the remedy? Well, Jesus can free you from this slavery that keeps you from becoming the person God has created you to be. If sin is restraining, mastering, or enslaving you, Jesus can break its power over your life.
