"SCOFFER" is someone who stubbornly scorns God's wisdom. "THE SIMPLE WILL LEARN PRUDENCE." Punishment is a deterrent for the simple who take warning from the fate of the wicked. Simple people must actually see what consequences come from disobedience. This is an indictment to us all. We may know well enough that lawlessness has its price, but we change our behavior only when the threat of punishment is near.
