We have in verse 16 a common and natural confession that should be on the lips of every Christian—"The Lord is great!" As saints and sinners, we are unable to keep God's Law perfectly, even though He requires that we do so. But by the power of His Word and Spirit and by faith, He instills in us a new desire—to live more perfectly. Our Lord Jesus kept the Law perfectly and died on our behalf that we might live with Him in His kingdom.
