God will judge with fairness and truth. Oh, how we long for fair treatment from others, but do we give it? We hate those who base their judgments on appearance, false evidence, or hearsay, but are we quick to judge others using those standards? Only Christ can be the perfectly fair judge. Only as He governs our hearts can we learn to be as fair in our treatment of others as we expect others to be toward us. The Messiah is the fulfillment of God's promise that a descendant of David would rule forever.
