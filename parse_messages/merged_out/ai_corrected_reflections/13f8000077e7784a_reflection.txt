A prominent theme in Isaiah is that non-Israelites would join the returning Israelites. (Isaiah 56:6, 7; 60:10; 61:15) God's intention was that through His faithful people, all the world would be blessed. Through the family of David, the whole world could be saved by Christ. We must never limit God's love to our own people. God loves the whole world.
