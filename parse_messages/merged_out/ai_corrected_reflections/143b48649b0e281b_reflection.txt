David saw his anguish as judgment for his sins—although God does not always send physical illness to punish us for our sins—this verse and others in Scripture indicate that He does in certain circumstances. Our sin can have physical or mental side effects that can cause a great amount of suffering. Sometimes God has to punish His children in order to bring them back to Himself. When we repent of our sins, God promises to forgive us. He will deliver us from sin's eternal consequences—but He does not promise to deliver us from all of sin's earthly consequences.
