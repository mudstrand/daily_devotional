The Bible speaks of God's full-forgiving grace in many ways: posting a notice that the debt is paid, treading our sins underfoot, hurling our iniquities into the sea, putting our sins behind His back. God assures us that for Jesus' sake, whose merit and mediation are ours by faith and sacrament, all our sins are completely and forever out of His sight and mind. In Christ, we are reconciled. We are God's children and the heirs of eternal life.
