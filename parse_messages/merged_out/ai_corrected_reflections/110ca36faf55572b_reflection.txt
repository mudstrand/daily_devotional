These two unchangeable things mentioned here are God's promise and His oath. God embodies all truth; so, He cannot lie. Because God is truth, you can be secure in His promise; you don't need to wonder if He will change His plans. Our hope is secure and immovable, anchored in God, just as a ship's anchor holds firmly to the seabed. To the true seeker who comes to God in belief, God gives an unconditional promise of acceptance. When you ask God with openness, honesty, and sincerity to save you from your sins, He will do it. This truth should give you encouragement, assurance, and confidence.
