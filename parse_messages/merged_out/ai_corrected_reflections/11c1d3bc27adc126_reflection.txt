The world is full of enticements. Every day we are confronted with subtle cultural pressures. The only way to escape these destructive influences is to ask God to help crucify our interest in them, just as Paul did. How much do the interests of this world matter to you? My suggestion is to read Galatians 2:20 and 5:24 for more on this concept.
