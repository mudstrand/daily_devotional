Jesus used the term "living water" in 4:10 to indicate eternal life. Here, He uses the term to refer to the Holy Spirit. The two go together. Whenever the Holy Spirit is accepted, He brings eternal life. Jesus teaches more about the Holy Spirit in Chapters 14-16. The Holy Spirit empowered Jesus' followers at Pentecost (Acts 2) and has since been available to all who believe in Jesus Christ.
