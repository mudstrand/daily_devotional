Paul's prayer was that the Ephesians would come to know Christ better. This should be the prayer of every Christian, because Christ is to be our model, and the more we know Him, the more we will be like Him. If we study Jesus' life in the Gospels, we will see what He was like 2,000 years ago. This will cause us to know Him better. A personal knowledge of Christ will change your life.
