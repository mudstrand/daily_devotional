Some Christians believe that faith is a personal matter that should be kept to oneself. It is true we shouldn't be boisterous or obnoxious in sharing our faith, but we should always be ready to give an answer, gently and respectfully, when asked about our faith, our lifestyle, or our Christian perspective. Are you prepared to tell others what Christ has done in your life?
