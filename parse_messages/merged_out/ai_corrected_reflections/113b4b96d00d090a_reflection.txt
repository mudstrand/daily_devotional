We who live in the new covenant do not observe the seal of the preparatory covenant. But we can learn much from Paul's comments about it. Abraham believed God would fulfill His promises, and in looking forward to the fulfillment, his faith was reckoned for righteousness. That is why he is called "The father of all who believe." Paul states that, in contrast to the life of faith, one who chooses to live by the law is obligated to meet the demands of the law. BUT this is a hopeless way, as the apostle wrote to the Galatians: "Cursed be every one who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law, and do them." (Galatians 3:10)
