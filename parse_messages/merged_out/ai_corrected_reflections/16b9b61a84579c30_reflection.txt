If you're a worrier, there's hope for you. Rick Warren, the author of The Purpose Driven Life, wrote: "When you think about a problem over and over in your mind, that's called worry. When you think about God's Word over and over in your mind, that's meditation. The more we meditate on God's Word, the less we need to worry. God uses those who can honestly say, "The Lord is my shepherd."
