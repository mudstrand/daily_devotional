David could say, "I love you, Lord," because he understood God was a fortress, a rock, and a deliverer (vs. 1-2). God was his shield, his salvation, and his stronghold. Maybe we have a hard time understanding David's praise because we have not experienced God's help. Is it because we reach for the phone before going to God for advice and help?
