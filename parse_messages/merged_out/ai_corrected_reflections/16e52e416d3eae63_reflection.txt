"Enter his gates with thanksgiving, and his courts with praise." (This to me is even speaking of the church today.) The emphasis is that this is God's place. I remember my mother talking about her dad, how he would make all her brothers remove their caps when they entered through the gates of the church yard, because it was God's holy place. How unfortunate it is that we have lost this respect for God's property, and often for God himself. Let this be our prayer: "Fill us with joyful praise and thanksgiving as we seek to serve you!"
