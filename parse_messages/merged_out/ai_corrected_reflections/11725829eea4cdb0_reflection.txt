Now, just as our bodies are the "Temple of the Holy Spirit" (1 Corinthians 6:19), the local church or Christian community is God's temple. Just as the Jews' temple in Jerusalem was not to be destroyed, the church is not to be spoiled and ruined by divisions, controversy, or other sins as members come together to worship God.
