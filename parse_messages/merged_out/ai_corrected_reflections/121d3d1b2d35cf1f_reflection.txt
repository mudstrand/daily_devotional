Jesus showed genuine love for this man, even though He knew that the man might not follow Him. Love is able to give tough advice; it doesn't hedge on the truth. Christ loved us enough to die for us, and He also loves us enough to talk straight to us. If His love were superficial, He would give us only His approval; but His love is complete, He gives us life-changing challenges.
