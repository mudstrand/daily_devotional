Wicked nations were plotting to overthrow God's anointed, thus ultimately opposing the Almighty Himself, and so He laughs. Is this a heartless or cruel laughter? No! His same infinite greatness that mocks man's defiance also marks His sympathy with man in his lost condition. God's laughter reminds us that Christ will ultimately triumph over evil. Remember mankind's limited potential accents God's limitless power.
