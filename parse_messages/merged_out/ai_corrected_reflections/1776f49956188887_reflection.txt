We often worry about position and status, hoping to get proper recognition for what we do. But Peter advises us to remember that God's recognition counts more than human praise. God is able and willing to bless us according to His timing. Humbly obey God regardless of present circumstances, and His good timing—either in this life or in the next—He will honor you!
