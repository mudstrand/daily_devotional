If we merely set out to please our neighbor, we will be people-pleasers (Galatians 1:10). We are to set aside willfulness and self-pleasing actions for the sake of building others up. Our Christian convictions must not be a disguise for cold-hearted treatment of our neighbors. Paul says: (Galatians 1:10) "Am I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ."
