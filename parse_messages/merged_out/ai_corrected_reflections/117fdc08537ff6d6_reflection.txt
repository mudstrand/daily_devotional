Winning a race requires purpose and discipline. Paul uses this illustration to explain that a Christian life often takes hard work, self-denial, and grueling preparation. As Christians, we are to be running toward our heavenly reward. The essential disciplines of prayer, Bible study, and worship equip us to run a successful race. Don't remain on the bleachers; don't just turn out to jog a couple of laps each morning. Train diligently; your spiritual progress depends upon it.
