I think we all have heard of people who have become rich and then lost everything. Even an average person can spend an inheritance or a paycheck with lightning speed and have little to show for it. My advice is, don't waste your time chasing fleeting earthly treasures. Instead, store up treasures in heaven, for such treasures will never be lost. (See Luke 12:33, 34 for Jesus' teaching.) Money seen as an end in itself quickly traps us and cuts us off from both God and the needy.
