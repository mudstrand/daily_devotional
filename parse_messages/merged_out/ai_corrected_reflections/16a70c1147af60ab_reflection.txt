Having been trained in Jewish religious law, Paul had been an angry and violent man toward those who followed Christ. (Acts 9:1-2) After being transformed by Christ, the tangled wreckage of his angry past was transformed into the love of Christ and others. (2 Corinthians 5:14-17) If you feel that your life is just an accumulation of junk, remember that God has always been in the restoration business. When we turn our lives over to Him, He makes us into something new and useful for Him and others.
