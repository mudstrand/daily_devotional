Are you frustrated with the inconsistencies of others or even in yourself? God is completely trustworthy; His intentions never change. There is a promise that whatever is good and perfect comes to us from the Creator who never changes (James 1:17). When you wonder if there is anyone you can trust, remember that God is completely consistent. We need to let Him counsel us.
