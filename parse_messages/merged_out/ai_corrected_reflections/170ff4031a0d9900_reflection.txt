Paul prayed that the Philippian believers would have the ability to differentiate between right and wrong, good and bad, vital and trivial. We need to pray for moral discernment so we can maintain our Christian morals and values. Hebrews 5:14 emphasizes the need for discernment. We need to remember to live each day as if this is the day Christ will return. Let us not forget to pray every day for the courageous health care workers and nursing home attendants.
