When we think of the law, we often think of something that keeps us from having fun. But here we see the opposite. God's laws revive us, make us wise, bring joy to the heart, give us insight, warn us, and reward us. God's laws are guidelines and lights for our path, rather than chains to our feet and hands. They point at danger to warn us, then point at success to guide us.
