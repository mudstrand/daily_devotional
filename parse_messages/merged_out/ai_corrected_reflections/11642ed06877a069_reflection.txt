These verses summarize the core of Christian living. If we love someone the way Christ loves us, we will be willing to forgive. If we have experienced God's grace, we will want to pass it on to others. Remember, grace is undeserved favor. By giving an enemy a drink, we are not excusing his misdeeds. We are recognizing him, forgiving him, and loving him in spite of his sins, just as Christ did for us.
