When the Scripture says, "In all they do, they prosper," it does not mean immunity to failure or difficulties. Nor is it a guarantee of health, wealth, or happiness. What the Bible means by prosperity is this: when we apply God's wisdom, the fruit we bear will be good, and will meet with God's approval. Just as a tree soaks up water and bears luscious fruit, we are also to soak up God's Word, producing actions and attitudes that honor God. To achieve anything worthwhile, we must have God's word in our hearts.
