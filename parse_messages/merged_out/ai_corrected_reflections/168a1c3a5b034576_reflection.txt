Charles Spurgeon once wrote, "If you are not seeking the Lord, the devil is seeking you." We must seek the Lord early and rely on His help. So, let's not move into any new day without being aware of the urgent need for the Lord. Being prepared is the best way to be ready for Satan's attack. So let us start each day with our armor in place and our marching orders in hand.
