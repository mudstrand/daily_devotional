We are all aware of the fact that food costs are going up today. Yes, food costs money, and only lasts for a short time, and it only meets our physical needs. But God offers us free nourishment that feeds our soul. How are we to get it? We are to come (55:1), listen (55:2), seek and call on God (55:6). YES, God's salvation is freely offered, but to nourish our souls, we must eagerly receive it. We will starve spiritually without this food as surely as we will starve physically without our daily bread.
