It is strange how these Jewish leaders were more concerned about their ceremonial laws than they were about putting to death an innocent person. They kept the ceremonial requirements of their religion while harboring murder and treachery in their hearts. When asked what the charges were, they couldn't even give an answer. But is our sin any less, when we neglect to attend worship—or when we neglect to give thanks, or when we neglect to give to the poor??? Didn't Jesus Himself say, "Whatever you do to the least of these, you do to Me"? When we neglect to do these things, we are really disobeying our Lord. We may not have outright murder in our heart, but being disobedient is the same as saying the Lord's will is unimportant.
