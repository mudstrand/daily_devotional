Paul had founded the church in Corinth, but in a year and a half, arguments and divisions arose, and some of the members of the church slipped back into an immoral lifestyle. Paul wrote this letter to address the problems and to clear up confusion about right and wrong so that they would remove the immorality from among them. The Corinthian people had a reputation for jumping from fad to fad; Paul wanted to keep Christianity from degenerating into just another fad. We should never, ever, seek for the perfect church, because if we were to ever find it and join it, it would no longer be perfect.
