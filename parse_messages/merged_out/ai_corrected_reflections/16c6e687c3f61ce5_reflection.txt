It is easy to take for granted all the material and spiritual blessings that God has given us. That's why we need to stop and remember that Scripture says the true owner of all we possess is God's: "Everything in heaven and earth is yours. Yours, Lord, is the kingdom: You are exalted as head over all" (1 Chronicles 29:11). Even our bodies do not belong to us. "You are not your own; you were bought with a price." We are so abundantly blessed with good things! Let us never take our heavenly Father for granted, but use wisely and gratefully all that He has given us. God gives blessings to us so we can give glory to Him.
