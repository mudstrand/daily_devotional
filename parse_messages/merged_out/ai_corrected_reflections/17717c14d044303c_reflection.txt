As the Corinthians awaited Paul's next visit, they were directed to (1) be on their guard against spiritual dangers, (2) stand firm in the faith, (3) be courageous, (4) be strong, and (5) do everything with kindness and in love. Today, as we wait for the return of Christ, we should follow the same instructions. We need to remember that love involves unselfish service to others; to show it gives evidence that you care. Remember to let love be your highest goal.
