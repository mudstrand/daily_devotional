By the "house of the Lord" and "His Temple," David could have been referring to the Tabernacle in Gibeon, or to the Temple that his son Solomon was to build—but David may have also used the word "Temple" to mean "The presence of the Lord." His greatest wish was to live in God's presence each day of his life. Sadly, this is not the greatest desire of many who claim to be believers. But those who desire to live in God's presence each day will be able to enjoy that relationship forever.
