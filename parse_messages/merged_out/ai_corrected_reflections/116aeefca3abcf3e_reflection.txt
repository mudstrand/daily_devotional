When we read books or listen to sermons, we should check the content of what is written or said so that we won't be fooled by smooth talk and glowing words. Christians who study God's Word, asking Him to reveal the truth, will not be fooled, but nominal Christians may be easily taken in. In Acts 17:10-12, we have an example of believers who carefully checked God's Word—read it.
