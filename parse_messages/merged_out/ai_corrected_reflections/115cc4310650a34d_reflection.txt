We who do believe are to take God's great message of salvation to others so they can respond to the Good News. How will your loved ones and neighbors hear unless someone tells them? Is God calling you to take a part in making His message known to your community? Do you know someone who needs to hear the Good News? Now ask God for a way that you can share so that they can hear it. Then do it as soon as possible.
