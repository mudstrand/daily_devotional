The gospel of Luke tells us that God sent an angel to ordinary shepherds to deliver an extraordinary birth announcement. Since then, this message has been spread through the centuries to us, and now we are Christ's messengers of joy to the world. Through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, we continue the practice of spreading the joy of Jesus as we follow His example and serve others. Let us take the joy of Christmas with us every day!
