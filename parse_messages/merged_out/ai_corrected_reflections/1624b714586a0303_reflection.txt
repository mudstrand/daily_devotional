Proverbs contains many strong statements about the benefits of wisdom, including long life, wealth, honor, and peace. If you are not experiencing them, it does not mean you are short on wisdom. Instead of guarantees, these statements are general principles. In a perfect world, wise behavior would always lead to these benefits.
