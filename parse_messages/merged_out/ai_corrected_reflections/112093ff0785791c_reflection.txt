Real love for others produces tangible actions. In vs. 2, we see hospitality to strangers. In the Old Testament, three people "entertained angels without realizing it": (1) Abraham (Genesis 18:1ff), (2) Gideon (Jud. 6:11ff), and (3) Manoah (Jud. 13:2ff). Some people say they cannot be hospitable because their homes are not large enough or nice enough. But if you have no more than a table and two chairs in a rented room, there are people who would be grateful to spend time in your home. Are there visitors to your church with whom you could share a meal? Do you know single people who would enjoy an evening of conversation? Is there any way your home could meet the needs of traveling missionaries? Hospitality simply means making other people feel comfortable and at home.
