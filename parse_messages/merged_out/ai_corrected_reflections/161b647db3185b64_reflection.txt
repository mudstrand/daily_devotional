It is easy to place more emphasis on human effort than on eternal faith, but God values the attitude of our heart above all else. Don't judge people's spirituality by their fulfillment of duties or by their level of human activity. And don't think that you satisfy God by feverishly doing His work. God notices all you do for Him and will reward you for it, but only if it comes as a loving response to His free gift of salvation.
