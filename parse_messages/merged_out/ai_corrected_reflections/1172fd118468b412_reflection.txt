Paul is not telling us to neglect the pursuit of knowledge. He is warning us not to glory in the wisdom of this age — (this life). God's way of thinking is far above ours; He knows all the futile thoughts of the "wise." The Corinthians were boasting about the wisdom of their leaders and teachers. Their pride made them value the messengers more than the message. We are not to put our trust in anyone but God.
