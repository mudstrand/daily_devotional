"No new commandment" — but yet — "A new commandment." Our Lord's love for us has made the old commandment to "love your neighbor" new and powerful. This commandment is true in Jesus and in those who believe in Him — "The beloved child, born of God," loves his brother because the love of Christ is at work in him. As the darkness passes, it does so in the light of His Gospel, which shines through His Word and Sacrament to a world lost in the darkness of this old age.
