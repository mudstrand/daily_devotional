Jesus, the Bread of Life, gained salvation for all when, in love, He became an atoning sacrifice on the cross. He called His disciples His friends, telling them that love prompted Him to lay down His life for them. What's more, His redeeming, life-giving love extends to all mankind, including His enemies. "When we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to Him through the death of His Son" (Romans 5:10). "Christ died, that's history... Christ died for you and me, that's salvation." AMEN
