Can we really do everything? The power we receive in union with Christ is sufficient to do His will and to face the challenges that arise from our commitment to do it. He does not grant us superhuman ability to accomplish anything we can imagine without regard to His interests. As we contend for the faith, we will face troubles, pressures, and trials. As they come, ask Christ to strengthen you.
