Paul reminds us here that winning a race requires purpose and discipline. Everything, no matter how attractive, might be a hindrance, thus we must give it up. Sometimes we groan and complain, but let us not forget we are running toward a heavenly reward. So let us not forget the essential disciplines of prayer, Bible study, and worship; these three will equip us to run the race set before us. So let us not merely observe from the grandstand; don't just turn out to jog a couple of laps each morning. Let us train diligently; our spiritual progress depends upon it.
