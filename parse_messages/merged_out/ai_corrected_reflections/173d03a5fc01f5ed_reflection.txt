God told His people dozens of times, "Be strong." Perhaps He tells us this because He knows He asks grand things from us, but also because He knows it can be human nature to be discouraged. Are there big plans in your life that you have abandoned because they seemed too challenging? Revisit them now with God's Word to propel you forward. Dear Lord, help me find the courage and strength to carry out Your plans.
