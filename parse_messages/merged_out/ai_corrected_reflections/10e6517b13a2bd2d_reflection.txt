Pilate asked Jesus a straightforward question, and Jesus answered clearly. Jesus is a King, but whose kingdom is not of this world. There seems to be no question in Pilate's mind that Jesus spoke the truth and was innocent of any crime. It also seems apparent that, while recognizing the truth, Pilate chose to reject it. It is a tragedy when we fail to recognize the truth. It is an even greater tragedy when we recognize the truth but fail to heed it.
