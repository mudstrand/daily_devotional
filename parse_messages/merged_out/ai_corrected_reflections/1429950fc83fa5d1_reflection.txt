God's light represents what is good, pure, true, holy, and reliable. Of course, darkness represents what is sinful and evil. God alone can guide us out of the darkness of sin. Light is also related to the truth in that light exposes whatever exists, whether it is good or bad. David exclaimed how he loved to worship in the house where the Lord lived. We should worship God with the same love and reverence as David did.
