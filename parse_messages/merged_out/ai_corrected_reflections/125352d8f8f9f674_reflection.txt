God will separate His obedient followers from pretenders and unbelievers. The real evidence of our belief is the way we act. To treat all persons we encounter as if they were Jesus is no easy task. What we do for others demonstrates what we really think about Jesus' words to us: "Feed the hungry, give the homeless a place to stay, look after the sick." Now ask yourself, "How well do my actions separate me from pretenders and unbelievers?"
