Jesus is the communicator of the goodness of God; He is also a participant in it. Like the heavenly Father, so also the Son is holy and wholly good. He calls Himself the Good Shepherd who cares for us and provides us with all we need for body and soul. That is why we can say with confidence: "Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." (Psalm 23:6)
