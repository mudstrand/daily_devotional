The one thing we should notice in Paul's writings to the Galatians is that he did not gain great popularity when he rebuked them for turning away from their first faith in Christ. I think that we would all have to agree that human nature hasn't changed much—we still get angry when we are scolded. But we shouldn't write off someone who challenges us. There may be truth in what he/she says. We should receive their words with humility, carefully thinking them over. When we discover that we need to change our attitude or actions, we should take steps to do so.
