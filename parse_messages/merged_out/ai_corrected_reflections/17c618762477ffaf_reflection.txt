Rich people often think they are wonderful, depending on no one, they take credit for all they do. But that's a hollow self-esteem. Through dependence upon God in their struggles, the poor may develop a richness of spirit that no amount of wealth can provide. The rich man can lose all his material wealth, while no one can take away a poor man's character. Don't be jealous of the rich; money may be all they will ever have.
