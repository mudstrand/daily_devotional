When it comes to our relationship with God, we don't need radios, phones, or emergency beacons. No matter how precarious our circumstances become, He already knows who and where we are. The psalmist celebrated this when he wrote, "You have searched me, Lord, and You know me. You are familiar with all my ways." (Psalm 139:1-3) Our needs are never hidden from God, and we are never separated from His care.
