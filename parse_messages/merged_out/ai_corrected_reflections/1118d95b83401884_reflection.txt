Abraham's life was filled with faith. At God's command, he left home and went to another land, obeying without question. (Genesis 12:1ff). He believed the covenant that God made with him. In obedience to God, Abraham was even willing to sacrifice his son Isaac (Genesis 22:1-19). Do not be surprised if God asks you to give up secure, familiar surroundings in order to carry out His will.
