Paul gave one answer to a dilemma: Buy whatever meat is sold without asking whether or not it has been offered to idols. It doesn't matter anyway, and no one's conscience would be bothered. When we become too worried about our every action, we become legalistic and cannot enjoy life. Remember, everything belongs to God, and He has given us all things to enjoy. If we know something is a problem, then we can deal with it, but we don't need to go looking for problems.
