The question to Nicodemus' question, "How can a man be born when he is old?" is: Only when we are willing to die to everything in this life, including our rights, our virtues, and our religion, and become willing to receive into ourselves a new life that we have never experienced before (John 3:4). This new life exhibits itself in our conscious repentance and through our unconscious holiness.
