Those who seek the Lord and His Kingdom are seeking eternal honor and glory even though they may not be aware that they are doing this. The promises of eternal reward are scattered throughout the Scriptures. These are meant to be encouragements to believers that they may remain steadfast in their following of Christ. But there are also warnings in the Scriptures, admonitions to everyone to be careful lest the reward and the crown are lost. This would be an eternal tragedy. So as we read in Revelation 2:10, let us be faithful unto death, and the Lord will give us the crown of life.
