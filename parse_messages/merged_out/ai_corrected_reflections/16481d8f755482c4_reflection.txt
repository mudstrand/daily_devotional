Wisdom is the ability to see life from God's perspective, and then will know the best course of action to take. Most people would agree that wisdom is a valuable asset, but how can we acquire it? Proverbs 9:10 teaches that the fear of the Lord (respect and honor) is the beginning of wisdom. Wisdom comes from knowing and trusting God; it is not merely the way to find God. God will lead to understanding and then sharing this knowledge with others.
