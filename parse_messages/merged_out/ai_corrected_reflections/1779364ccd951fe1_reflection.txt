How wonderful it is to see that Christ's church continues to grow. But, it has not been completed just because these places have been evangelized. Remember our Lord says to every generation: "You will be my witnesses . . . to the ends of the earth." To this day, all of Christ's followers are to teach all nations the Word of salvation and baptize them in the name of the Triune God. He who suffered and died for the sins of mankind says "That Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem" (Luke 24:46-47). Remember, it is our call and privilege to be Christ's witnesses wherever we are in this world and to send missionaries to places beyond our reach.
