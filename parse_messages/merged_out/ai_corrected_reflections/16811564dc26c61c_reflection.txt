In our walk of faith, we should come to Jesus Christ, humbled by our unworthiness. We come with no sense of entitlement as we receive His grace and should be overwhelmed by the abundance of His love. They remind us of all His benefits. Heavenly Father, let us always pause to consider all we have in You.
