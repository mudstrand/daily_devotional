When it comes to taking the initiative against drudgery, we have to take the first step as though there were no God. There is no point in waiting for God to help us, he will not. But once we arise, immediately we will find he is there. Whenever God gives us his inspiration, suddenly taking the initiative becomes a moral issue, a matter of obedience. Then we must act to be obedient and not lie down and do nothing. If we arise and shine, drudgery will be divinely transformed. When the Lord does something through us, he always transforms it. Our Lord takes our human flesh and transforms it, and now every believer's body has become "the temple of the Holy Spirit."
