What kind of friend are you? There is a vast difference between knowing someone well and being a true friend. The greatest evidence of genuine friendship is loyalty, being available to help in times of distress or personal struggle. Too many people are fair-weather friends. They stick around when the friendship helps THEM and leave when they are not getting anything out of the relationship. Be the kind of true friend the Bible encourages.
