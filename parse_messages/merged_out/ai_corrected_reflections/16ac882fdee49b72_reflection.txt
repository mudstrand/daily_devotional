When Martha and Mary invited Jesus to their house, it was spiritual food that Mary chose when she sat at the feet of Jesus (Luke 10:39). Martha, on the other hand, was concerned about physical food. Mary was taking time to be near their guest and listen to the Lord Jesus. Let us also take time. Let us remember John 6:35, which tells us He feeds our hearts with spiritual food. HE IS THE BREAD THAT SATISFIES.
