The writer of Proverbs is talking about a prostitute and is warning against illicit sex for several reasons. A prostitute's charm is used as an example of any temptation to do wrong and leave the pursuit of wisdom. Sexual immorality of any kind was and still is extremely dangerous. Sexual immorality is against God's law.
