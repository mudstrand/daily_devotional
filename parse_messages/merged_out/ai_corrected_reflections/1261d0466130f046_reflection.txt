In the following verses, the psalmist writes about the fear of earthquakes and such. Today, people fear terrorist attacks and the economy crumbling and such. But the psalmist says even if the world ends, we need not fear. In the face of complete destruction, the writer expressed a quiet confidence in God's ability to save him. Yes, it does seem impossible to consider the end of the world without becoming consumed by fear, but the Bible is clear: God is our refuge even in the midst of total destruction. He is not merely a temporary retreat; He is our eternal refuge and can provide strength in any circumstance.
