The cloud and the sea mentioned here refer to Israel's escape from slavery in Egypt when God led them by a cloud and brought them safely through the Red Sea (Ex. 14). The miraculous food and water were the provisions God gave as they traveled through the wilderness (Exodus 15-16). "They were baptized in the cloud and the sea" means that just as we are united with Christ by baptism, so the Israelites were united under Moses' leadership and the events of the Exodus out of Egypt.
