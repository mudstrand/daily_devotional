Abraham never doubted that God would fulfill His promise. Abraham's life was marked by mistakes, sins, and failures as well as by wisdom and goodness, but he constantly trusted God. His faith was strengthened by the obstacles he faced, and his life was an example of faith in action. If he had looked only at his own resources for subduing Canaan and founding a nation, he would have given up in despair. But Abraham looked to God, obeyed Him, and waited for God to fulfill His word.
