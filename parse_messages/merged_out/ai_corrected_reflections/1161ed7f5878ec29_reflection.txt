Healthy self-esteem is important because some of us think too little of ourselves; on the other hand, some overestimate themselves. The key to an honest and accurate self-evaluation is knowing the basis of our self-worth ~~ our identity in Christ. Apart from Him, we aren't capable of very much by eternal standards; in Him, we are valuable and capable of worthy service. Evaluating yourself by the worldly standards of success and achievement can cause you to think too much about your worth in the eyes of others and so miss your true value in God's eyes.
