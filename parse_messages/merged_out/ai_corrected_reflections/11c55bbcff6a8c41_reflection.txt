It has, and always will be, God's purpose to offer salvation to the world, which He planned since the beginning of time. God is sovereign; He is in charge. Oh, so often our lives seem to become chaotic, but we can always rest in this truth: Jesus is Lord, and God is in control. God's purpose to save you cannot be thwarted, no matter what evil Satan may bring.
