(Sometimes), all we need to do is talk over our problem with a friend to help put it into perspective. David frequently claimed that God was slow to react on his behalf. I believe we too often feel this same impatience. Often, it seems that evil and suffering go unchecked, and we wonder when God is going to stop them. But David affirmed that he would continue to trust God no matter how long he would have to wait for God's justice to materialize. Through prayer, we can express our feelings and take our problems to God. He will help us regain the right perspective, and this will give us peace of mind.
