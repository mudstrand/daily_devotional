IT CAN BE challenging to rely on God's wisdom when you don't fully understand His ways. But when you recognize that your human insight is not as brilliant as God's, you can realize your insecurities and trust His plan. Dear Lord, I invite You to direct my steps right now. I trust that You know what is best for me. Amen.
