It is human nature to make plans and then ask God to bless them. Instead, we should seek God's will first. By communicating with God, it allows Him to counsel us and give us wisdom. Believers and unbelievers alike experience pain, trouble, and failure at times (Matthew 5:45). Unbelievers have a sense of hopelessness and confusion about life over their purpose on earth. Those who seek God, however, can move ahead, confident in knowing what is right in God's eyes. They know that God will keep them from straying off His chosen path.
