Nothing has changed. The Lord Jesus still sends His messengers into the world. Their mission has not changed. They are to tell everyone that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners from sin, death, and the power of the devil. We are all participants in the church's mission. No rain, snow, nor gloom of night can keep us from completing our appointed assignment.
