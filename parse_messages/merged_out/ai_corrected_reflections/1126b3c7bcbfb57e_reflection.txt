All who are in Christ are entitled saints of God. There is no exception. There is no middle class. Despite all degrees of sin among humans, there are simply two classes in relation to God, namely, Christians and non-Christians, saints or sinners. Saintliness is the acceptance of Christ's merit and worthiness. It is being made the partaker of an inheritance otherwise not one's own. It is a gift of divine grace because even the most mature saints are not sinless and holy in themselves. Paul's greeting, "May grace and peace be yours from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ," has two directives. "Grace" relates to the forgiveness of sins; "Peace" relates to a conscience free from unrest. When we have learned that no evil can befall us without the Father's knowledge, and that He wills only blessing for the believer, then there can be true peace of mind and heart. Our Lord spoke of this when He said, "Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you" (John 14:27).
