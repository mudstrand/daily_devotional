An outreach to the Gentiles is not unique to the N.T. We also see it in Isaiah 49:6 and many other O.T. passages. Although God chose us "before the foundation of the world" (Ephesians 1:4), His choice was not arbitrary. He chose us to be saved by Christ and in union with Christ, who Himself is God's "Chosen One" (Luke 9:35). Thank God that He chose us in love, not anger or judgment.
