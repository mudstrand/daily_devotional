When James says, "any of you," we know by vs. 2 he is referring to struggling Christians. He is actually calling them back to faith. Remember that God gives generously to all who ask in faith, whatever their past. Without trust in God's faithfulness, a person has no solid foundation. Only in faith, which trusts in God's provision, does one receive His blessings. "Double-minded" here means two allegiances: God and the world. Such a person cannot persevere.
