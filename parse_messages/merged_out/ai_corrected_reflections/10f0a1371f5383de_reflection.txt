Jesus led Peter through an experience that would remove the cloud of his denial. Peter had denied Jesus three times. Three times Jesus asked Peter if he loved Him. When Peter answered "yes," Jesus told him to "feed My sheep." It is one thing to say you love Jesus, but the real test is a willingness to serve Him. Peter had repented, and here Jesus was asking him to commit his life. Peter's life changed when he finally realized who Jesus was. His occupation changed from fisherman to evangelist; his denial changed from impetuous to "rock," and his relationship to Jesus changed—he was forgiven, and he finally understood the significance of Jesus' words about His death and resurrection. How would you respond if Jesus asked you, "Do you love Me?" Do you really love Jesus? Are you even His friend?
