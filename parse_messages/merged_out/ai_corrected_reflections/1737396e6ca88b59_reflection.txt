The news that Jesus is not only faithful to save us but faithful to sustain and strengthen us—this forms a base of operation for His followers. It's a truth to which we can return when our strength is failing. Focusing our thoughts on the gospel of Jesus Christ makes us stronger than we were the day before. Remembering what He's done and is doing increases our strength for all that lies between here and heaven.
