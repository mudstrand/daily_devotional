IMPORTANT: Corrections needed.

Paul makes it clear that we should not disassociate ourselves from unbelievers – otherwise we could not carry out Christ's command to tell them about salvation (Matthew 28:18-20). But we are to distance ourselves from the person who claims to be a Christian, yet indulges in sins that are forbidden in Scripture. Such people often rationalize their actions. When rationalizing sins, a person harms others for whom Christ died and dims the image of God in himself or herself. A church that includes such a person is hardly fit to be the light of the world. To do so would distort the picture of Christ it is to present to the world. Church leaders must be ready to correct, in love, for the sake of spiritual unity.
