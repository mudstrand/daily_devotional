Each person was to set aside an amount proportionate to their income and bring what they had set aside for the Lord's work. The Christians in Jerusalem were suffering from poverty and famine. There are people today too who are suffering from poverty to the point where they cannot buy enough food or clothing for themselves. Our churches should seek out the needs of people in our community and on the mission field and be ready to support them in any way we can.
