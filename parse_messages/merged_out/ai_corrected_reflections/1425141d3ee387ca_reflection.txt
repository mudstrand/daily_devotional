Death can cast a frightening shadow over us, because we are entirely helpless in its presence. We can struggle with other enemies—pain, suffering, disease, and injury, but strength and courage cannot overcome death—it has the final word. Only one person can walk with us through death's dark valley and bring us safely to the other side—to the God of life, our shepherd. Because life is uncertain, we should follow this shepherd who offers us eternal comfort.
