When we suffer pain or loss, we sometimes ask the question, "If the Lord is with us, why has all this happened?" While the Bible tells us the future of human history, it supplies no specific explanation of the events that take place daily in our lives. Sometimes when tragedy strikes, we understand very little and are unable to fathom the mystery of disease or accidents. Are you going through circumstances you don't understand? Continue to trust His wisdom and goodness. Remember, He is our guide.
