Jesus points out that the birds are not only providers for others but that God provides for them. The lesson is: God's people are not to worry about the future. They are, to be sure, to make plans, but they are not to doubt the faithfulness of their provider. God, our Creator and Provider, is also our Redeemer. God's Son came to earth to quench the hunger and thirst of the soul by making full restitution for our sins. Through Him, we are redeemed from sin and death.
