What a wonderful promise! Not only forgiveness and pardon are assured to the children of light, but glory and honor are added. What we see here is there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. (Romans 8:1) Our Prayer for Today Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you again today for Your grace and mercy. Forgive me for the sins I have committed. Lead me in the paths of righteousness. Amen. Keep looking up, we serve a true and just God. You're in the prayers of two who care.
