Two sure ways to destroy a building are to tamper with the foundation and to build with inferior materials. The church must be built on Christ, not on any other person or principle. Christ will evaluate each minister's contribution to the life of the church, and Judgment Day will reveal the sincerity of each person's work. God will determine whether or not a person has been faithful to Jesus' instructions. Good work will be rewarded; unfaithful or inferior work will be discounted. "The builders themselves will be saved, but like one escaping through a wall of flames" means that unfaithful workers will be saved but only by the skin of their teeth. All their accomplishments will count for nothing.
