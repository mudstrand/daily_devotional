As we follow Jesus through the Gospels, one thing that we will notice is how Jesus spent His time. His calendar gives us a clear picture of who He really was. He was visited by shepherds. A man who ate locusts prepared the way for His ministry, and His best friends were smelly fishermen. For a greater list, read (Matthew 4:14). Now, if Jesus is the embodiment of God's will on earth, then it's clear what His will is for us as His church, His people. What does your schedule show your friends about who you are?
