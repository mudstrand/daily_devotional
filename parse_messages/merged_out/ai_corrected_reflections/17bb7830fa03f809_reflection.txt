Those who fear the Lord receive "protection from harm," because of their healthy habits, their beneficial lifestyle, and sometimes through God's direction and intervention. Nevertheless, the fear of the Lord does not always protect us from the trouble in this life. Evil things still happen to people who love the Lord. This verse is not a universal promise but a general guideline. It describes what would happen if this world were sinless, what will happen in the new earth when faithful believers will be under God's protection forever.
