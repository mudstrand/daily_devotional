We are called to praise our Creator! Are we truly praising Him for all that He has done? Make your job or responsibility in the church an act of praise by doing it in reverence to Him. Honor Him with the quality of your work and the attitude of service you bring to it. Worship the Lord and experience the joy of His blessings.
