Paul says that, as students of God's word, it is our responsibility to take care of the material needs of our teachers (I Corinthians 9:7-12). It is easy to receive the benefits of good Bible teaching and then take our spiritual leaders for granted, ignoring their financial and physical needs. We should care for our teachers, not grudgingly or reluctantly, but with a generous spirit, showing honor and appreciation for all they have done (I Timothy 5:17, 18).
