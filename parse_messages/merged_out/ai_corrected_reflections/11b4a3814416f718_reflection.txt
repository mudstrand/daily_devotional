God kept His promise to Abraham (Genesis 17:7, 8) — He has not revoked it, though thousands of years have passed. He saved Abraham through his faith, and He blessed the world through Abraham by sending the Messiah as one of Abraham's descendants. Circumstances may change, but God remains constant and does not break His promises. He has promised to forgive our sins through Jesus Christ, and we can be sure He will do so. Praise the Lord, what a Savior.
