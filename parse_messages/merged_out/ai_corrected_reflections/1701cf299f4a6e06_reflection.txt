"Wisdom may best describe our present scientific and cultural plateau, yet spiritually we are foolish for sure. Many men, seen as wise in the eyes of the world, are foolish in the eyes of our God. God, in no uncertain terms, has said, "Fools make a mock at sin" (Proverbs 14:9). Our world says, "Do what makes you feel good; do your own thing!" God has said, "He that trusts in his own heart is a fool" (Proverbs 28:26). The rich farmer in the twelfth chapter of Luke, who found comfort in his accumulation of worldly goods, would be seen by many among us today as a very wise man. But God called him a fool (Luke 12:20). Our nation seems to be floating with the tide of moral and spiritual corruption. Are you drifting with the tide, or are you willing to stem the tide? I would rather be a fool in the eyes of a foolish world, than a fool in the eyes of my all-wise Creator.
