If we think that working for God doesn't matter, we should turn to the promise that what we do for Jesus will last for eternity (I Corinthians 3:11-15). If we fear we have sinned too greatly for God to use us, we must remember we've been forgiven by the power of Jesus's blood (Matthew 26:28). And if we're worried we might fail if we try to serve God, we should remember that Jesus said we will bear fruit as we abide in Him (John 15:5). God's Word is our divine defense.
