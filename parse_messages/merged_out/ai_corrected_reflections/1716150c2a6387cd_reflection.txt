Jesus was not questioning God; He was quoting the first line of Psalm 22—a deep expression of the anguish He felt when He took on the sins of the whole world. This caused Him to be separated from His Father. This is what Jesus dreaded as He prayed to God in the garden to take the cup from Him (Matthew 26:39). The physical agony was horrible, but even worse was the period of spiritual separation from God. Jesus suffered this double death so that we would never have to experience eternal separation from God.
