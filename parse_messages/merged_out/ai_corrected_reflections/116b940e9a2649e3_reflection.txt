As is very plain here, we see that Paul was given a special calling from God to preach about Jesus Christ. The calling of every Christian is not always so obvious, but each Christian has a job to do, a role to take, or a contribution to make. One assignment may seem more spectacular than another, but all are necessary to carry out God's greater plans for His church and for His world (see I Corinthians 12:12-27). The most important thing is that we remain available to God by placing our gifts at His service. Then, as you discover what He calls you to do, be ready to do it.
