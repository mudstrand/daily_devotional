The habit of diligent prayer prepares us for times of trouble when prayer is especially needed. How sad the situation of King Saul when, filled with fear of the large Philistine army, "he inquired of the Lord, but the Lord did not answer him" (1 Samuel 28:6). It was too late. His unbelief and neglect of prayer took their toll.
