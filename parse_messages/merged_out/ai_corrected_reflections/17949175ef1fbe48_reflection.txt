People who live for God often wonder why they still have temptations. Does God tempt them? Heavens, no! God tests people, but He does not tempt them by trying to seduce them to sin. God allows Satan to tempt people; however, this is done to refine their faith and help them grow in their dependence on Christ. We can only resist the temptation to sin by turning to God for strength and choosing to obey His Word. The problem today is that people often ruin their lives by their own foolishness and then are angry at the Lord.
