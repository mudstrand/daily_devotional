My heart hurts whenever I picture those closed doors. I think of Jesus letting us know that if we knock, He will always open the door to us. I guess I've always imagined us knocking to get in and Jesus opening the door to welcome us inside. But as I pray for others, I now realize that sometimes when I knock, we're the ones who are inside, and we need Jesus to free us to come out and to let others pour in. Following Jesus can mean opening doors—literal and metaphorical—that create isolation between ourselves and others.
