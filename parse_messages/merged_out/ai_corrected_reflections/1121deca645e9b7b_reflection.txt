We become content when we realize God's sufficiency for our needs. Christians who become materialistic are saying by their actions that God can't take care of them, or at least that He won't take care of them the way they want. Insecurity can lead to the love of money, whether we are rich or poor. The only antidote is to trust God to meet all our needs.
