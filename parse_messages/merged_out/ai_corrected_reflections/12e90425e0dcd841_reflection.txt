When was the last time you gave praise to the Lord in such a way? Lord, You are my God; I will exalt You and praise Your name, for in perfect faithfulness You have done wonderful things, things planned long ago. Have you forgotten that our Lord Jesus Christ sits on the throne? Do you praise His name for His faithfulness and the wonderful things He has done? Let us give praise, for He is wonderful!
