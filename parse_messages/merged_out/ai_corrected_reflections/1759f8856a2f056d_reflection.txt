Forgiveness involves both attitudes and actions. If you find it difficult to feel forgiving toward someone who has hurt you, try praying for them and your attitude every day. Then try responding with kind actions. If appropriate, tell this person that you would like to heal your relationship. Lend a helping hand. Send him or her a gift. Smile at him or her. Many times you will discover right actions lead to right feelings.
