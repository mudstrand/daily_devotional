The Apostle Paul has explained that all people are classified under the jurisdiction of the law. BUT now he presents a new theme, the gospel message of the righteousness of God available to believers. This righteousness is the rock of salvation...It is the great wonder that we can be counted righteous through Jesus Christ and in this way are made acceptable in His sight. Since His righteousness is of eternal worth, we have a covering and an atonement for the most hideous sins. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be like wool" (Isaiah 1:18).
