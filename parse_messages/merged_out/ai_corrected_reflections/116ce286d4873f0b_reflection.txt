Paul guaranteed the Corinthian believers that God would consider them "free from blame" when Christ returns. This guarantee was not because of their great gifts or their shining performance, but because of what Jesus Christ accomplished for them through His death and resurrection. All who have asked Jesus Christ into their heart and have a personal relationship with Him will be considered blameless when He returns. If you have faith in Christ, even if it is weak, you are and will be saved.
