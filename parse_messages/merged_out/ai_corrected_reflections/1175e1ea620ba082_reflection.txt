As the Hebrews prepared to leave Egypt, and become free people once again, they were commanded to prepare bread without yeast because they didn't have time to wait for it to rise. And because yeast was also a symbol for sin, they were commanded to sweep all of it out of the house. Christ is our Passover Lamb, the perfect sacrifice for sin. Because He has delivered us from the slavery of sin, we should have nothing to do with the sins of the past.
