All people have one master or another, and they pattern themselves after him. Without Jesus, we would have no choice; we would be enslaved to sin, and the result would be guilt, suffering, and separation from God. Thanks to Jesus, however, we can now choose God as our Master. Following Him, we can enjoy new life and learn how to work for Him. Are you still serving your first master, sin? Or have you chosen God?
