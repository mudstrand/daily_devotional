Some think that belief in God is a crutch for weak people who cannot make it on their own. Yes, God is a shield to protect us when we are too weak to face certain trials by ourselves. But He does not want us to remain weak. He strengthens, protects, and guides us in order to send us back into this evil world to fight for Him. And then He continues to work with us, because the strongest person on earth is infinitely weaker than God and needs His help. David was not a coward; he was a mighty warrior who, even with all his warriors, knew that only God could protect him.
