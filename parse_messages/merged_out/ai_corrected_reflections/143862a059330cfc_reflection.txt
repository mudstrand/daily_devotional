We should never envy evil people, even though some may be extremely popular or excessively rich. No matter how much they have, it will fade and vanish like grass that withers and dies. Those who follow God live differently from the wicked, and in the end, will have treasures in heaven. What an unbeliever gets on earth may last a lifetime, but what you get from God lasts forever.
