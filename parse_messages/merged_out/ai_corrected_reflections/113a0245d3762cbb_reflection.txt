As creation offers external witness to the creative power of God, the law written within the conscience of each individual renders an internal testimony of the law's demands. Our conscience-light, even though it was dimmed by the Fall into sin, places man under the compulsion of responsibility. However, the law can never lead to true blessedness and peace, but only to condemnation and despair. But let us remember, the believer is free from his sins and judgment by the law through the Savior's merit and finished work of atonement.
