"We shall see Him as He is," John writes. With eyes of faith, I see my Savior now in the pages of His Holy Word. With the eyes of my heart, I have imagined what He looks like. But in heaven, I'll know. In heaven, I'll see Him face-to-face. What a sight that will be, that first look at His spotless purity, His splendid power, and especially His saving grace. And that sight will be for all those who have become His children through His great love.
