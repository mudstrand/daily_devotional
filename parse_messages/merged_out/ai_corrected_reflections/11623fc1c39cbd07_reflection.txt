Paul uses the concept of the human body to teach how Christians should live and work together. Just as the parts of the body function under the direction of the brain, in like manner Christians are to work together under the command and authority of Jesus Christ. Paul writes in more detail of this in (1 Corinthians 12:12-31; and Ephesians 4:1-16).
