There is a big difference between the flame of a candle and the roaring blast of a forest fire. We cannot even stand near a raging fire. Even with sophisticated firefighting equipment, a consuming fire is often beyond human control. God is not within our control either. We cannot force Him to do anything for us through our prayers. He cannot be contained. Yet He is a God of compassion. He has saved us from sin, and He will save us from death. But everything that is worthless and sinful will be consumed by the fire of His wrath. Only what is good, dedicated to God, and righteous will remain.
