Many of us will pass into heaven through death, but for some, that thought causes great anxiety. Some worry that the process of dying will be too difficult to bear. But with the assurance of Jesus as our Savior, we can rest in the confidence that when we close our eyes on earth and pass through death, we will open our eyes in God's presence. As we look forward to seeing Jesus in heaven, it will be our greatest joy.
