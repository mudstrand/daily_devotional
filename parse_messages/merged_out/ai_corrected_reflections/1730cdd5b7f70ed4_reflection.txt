When we give with no thought of receiving, we show what it means to truly serve others. But that means we need to be careful that we don't allow the world to corrupt us; we need to commit ourselves to Christ's ethical and moral system, not on the world's. We are not to adapt to the world's value system, which is based on money, power, and pleasure. True faith means nothing if we are contaminated with such values.
