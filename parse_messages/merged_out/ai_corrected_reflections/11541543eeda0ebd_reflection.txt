When we turn away from sin's appeal by the Holy Spirit's power, regarding sin as dead, we can ignore/overcome temptation when it comes. Let's review what Paul wrote in (Romans 6:10, 11). He, Jesus, died once to defeat sin, and now He lives for the glory of God. So you should consider yourselves dead to sin and able to live for the glory of God through Christ Jesus. What Paul is saying is that we should regard our old sinful nature as dead and unresponsive to sin—that is, if we identify ourselves with Christ. If and when we start a new life in Christ, the Holy Spirit is there to help us become all Christ wants us to be.
