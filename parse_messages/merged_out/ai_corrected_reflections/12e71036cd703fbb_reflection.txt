The sending of the Holy Spirit, who equips people for Jesus' missions. The Holy Spirit's power makes our witness effective. Luth: It's as if he would say, "I'll place armor on you that will withstand every shot." Self-discipline, self-control. You cannot control the length of your life, but you can control its width and depth. You cannot control the contour of your face, but you can control its expression. You cannot control the weather, but you can control the atmosphere of your mind. Why should we worry about things we cannot control when we can keep ourselves busy controlling the things that depend on us?
