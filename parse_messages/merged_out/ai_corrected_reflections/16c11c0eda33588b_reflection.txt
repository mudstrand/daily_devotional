Once you have begun to walk with God, you need only to keep walking with Him, and all of life becomes one long stroll. As we sense the strength of God's everlasting arms beneath us, we can stroll through life with confidence, as long as we keep our hand in the hand of our unseen Companion. We can be confident about tomorrow if we walk with God today.
