People can rationalize anything if they have no standards judging right and wrong. We can always prove that we are right. But before putting any plan into action, ask yourself these questions: (1) Is this plan in harmony with God's truth? (2) Will it work under real-life conditions? (3) Is my attitude pleasing to God? If you have answered these questions truthfully, your plans will be pleasing to God!
