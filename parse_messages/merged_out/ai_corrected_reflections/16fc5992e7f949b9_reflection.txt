Have you ever sensed the challenge of Jesus to align your thoughts with the truth? Do not make an idol of your daily rituals, Jesus said. They aren't the source of your strength and joy and peace: I am. He was right! Yes, Jesus graciously reminds us to return our focus to Him. In doing so, you will discover that you don't need your old routine for everything to be okay. When we have Jesus, He is enough.
