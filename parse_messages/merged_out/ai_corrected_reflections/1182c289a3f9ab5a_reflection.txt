The idea of unity and fellowship with God through eating a sacrifice was strong in Judaism and Christianity as well as in paganism. In Old Testament times, when a Jew offered a sacrifice, he ate a part of that sacrifice as a way of restoring his unity with God, against whom he had sinned (Deuteronomy 12:17, 18). Similarly, we as Christians participate in Christ's once-for-all sacrifice at the Lord's table when we eat the bread and drink the wine. This symbolizes His body and blood.
