The "night" refers to the present evil time. The "day" refers to the time of Christ's return. When Christ returns, He wants to find His people clean on the inside as well as on the outside. Now, the only way that can become possible is to let Christ take control of us. So, how do we let Christ take control of our life? (First) we identify with Christ by being baptized (Galatians 3:27). This shows our solidarity with other Christians and with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. (Second) we exemplify the qualities Jesus showed while He was here on earth (love, humility, truth, service). In a sense, we role-play what Jesus would do in our situation. We must also avoid those situations that open the door to gratifying sinful desires.
