Bowing before the Lord means recognizing that our worth comes from God alone. To be "humbled" involves leaning on His power and guidance, and not going our own independent way. Even though we do not deserve God's favor, He wants to lift us up and give us worth and dignity, despite our human shortcomings. After our repentance comes God's forgiveness, new life, and the crown of life (James 1:12). Jesus teaches that those who humble themselves before God will be exalted (Luke 18:14).
