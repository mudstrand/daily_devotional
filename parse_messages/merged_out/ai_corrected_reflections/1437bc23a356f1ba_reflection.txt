"Fountain of Life" is a vivid image of fresh, cleansing water that gives life to the spiritually thirsty. This same picture is used in Jeremiah 2:13, where God is called "Fountain of living water." Jesus spoke of Himself as living water that could quench thirst forever and give eternal life (John 4:14). Why then should we deprive our souls? The living Word, Jesus Christ, and the written Word, the Bible, which can satisfy our hungry and thirsty souls.
