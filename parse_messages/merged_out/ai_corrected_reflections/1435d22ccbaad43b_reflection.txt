In the previous verses of this chapter, David prayed for God's intervention, but he was sad because he thought his prayers were going unanswered. When our prayers are delayed, it is easy to assume that God has not answered, but remember, God hears our every prayer, which He answers according to His wisdom. Don't let the absence of an immediate answer cause you to doubt or resent God. Instead, let it be an occasion to deepen your faith.
