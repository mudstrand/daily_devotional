Even during the bitterest hours of His Passion, Jesus gave witness to God's judgment on unbelief: telling the Sanhedrin that the Son of Man would come as their judge, telling the mourners to shed no tears for Him but for themselves lest God's judgment come upon them. At the same time, our Lord proclaimed God's saving grace. He proclaimed it to the dying thief who repented. And He proclaimed it in the strongest terms possible when on the cross He gave His life as a ransom for all.
