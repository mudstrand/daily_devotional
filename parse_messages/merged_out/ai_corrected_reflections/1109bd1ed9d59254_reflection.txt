In order to become mature Christians, we need to learn discernment. We must train our conscience, our senses, our mind, and our body to distinguish good from evil. Are you able to recognize temptation before it traps you? Can you tell the difference between a correct use of Scripture and a mistaken use? Our ability to understand the deeper knowledge of God is the determining factor in our spiritual growth. Too often, we want God's banquet before we are spiritually capable of digesting it. As you grow in the Lord and put into practice what you have learned, your capacity to understand will also grow.
