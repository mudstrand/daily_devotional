We have examples throughout Scripture of what happened to people who rejected God's chosen. For one example, look at 1 Samuel; Israel rejected God's judges, and instead they wanted a king, and that's what they got. That turned out to be a big mistake. We had better begin to pray for a leader of God's choosing and pray that we don't get what we deserve, like the Israelites did.
