Are you beginning to understand why the Apostle Paul calls Jesus "wisdom from God"? Jesus is our "redemption." He brought us back from sin's bondage. He is our "righteousness." His payment for our sin and His perfect keeping of God's commandments enables us to stand unafraid before the heavenly Judge. He is our "holiness." When God looks at us, He no longer sees a hated sinner but His dear child. When God's grace leads us to Jesus, we're truly wise. Then we know what we need to know.
