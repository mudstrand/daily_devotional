We may respond to discipline in several ways: (1) We can accept it with resignation; (2) We can accept it with pity; (3) We can be angry and resentful toward God; or (4) We can accept it gratefully, as the appropriate response we owe a loving Father. When God corrects you, see it as proof of His love, and ask Him what He is trying to teach you.
