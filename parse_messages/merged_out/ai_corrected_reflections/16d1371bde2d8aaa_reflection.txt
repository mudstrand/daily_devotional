The psalmist portrays powerful people as inadequate saviors, making false promises they cannot deliver (Psalm 146:3). God is the hope and the help of the needy. Jesus confirms His concern for the poor and afflicted in (Luke 4:18-21). He does not separate the physical needs from the spiritual needs but attends to both. While God, not the government, is the hope of the needy, we are His instruments to help here on earth.
