Jesus desires that we should surrender to His service the little we have, our small gifts and strengths and resources. The rest He will look after. His blessing will make the little suffice. Unbelief says that it is insufficient to come with the little we have for an enterprise so great! Faith says, Jesus asks for the little we have, and He will take it into His service. He will bless it until there is more than enough. When we lay our gift in the Lord's hand (and not in any man's) it will stretch as far as the Lord wills.
