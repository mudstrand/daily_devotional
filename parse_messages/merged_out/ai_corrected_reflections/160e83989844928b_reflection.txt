God cannot tolerate sin because His nature is morally perfect. He cannot ignore or condone willful rebellion. God wants to remove the sin and restore the sinner, and He is able to, as long as the sinner does not stubbornly distort or reject the truth. Don't suppress the truth about Him merely to protect your own lifestyle.
