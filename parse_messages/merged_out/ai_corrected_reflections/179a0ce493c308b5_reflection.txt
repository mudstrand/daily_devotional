Have you ever known anyone who claimed to be wise but acted foolishly? True wisdom can be measured by a person's character. Just as you can identify a tree by the fruit it produces, you can evaluate your wisdom by the way you act. Foolishness leads to disorder, but wisdom leads to peace and goodness. Are you tempted to escalate the conflict, pass on gossip, or fan the fire of discord? Careful, winsome speech and wise, loving words are the seeds of peacemakers.
