It should bring great joy to a Christian to see another person come to faith in Christ and mature in that faith. Paul experienced this joy many times. He thanked God for those who had come to know Christ and for their strong faith. He also prayed for their continued growth. If there are new Christians who have brought you joy, thank God for them and support them as they continue to grow in the faith.
