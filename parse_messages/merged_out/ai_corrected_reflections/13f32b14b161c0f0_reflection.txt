In Luke 15:1-10, we have the story of the lost coin and the lost sheep, which could not return by themselves. In this parable, the father watched and waited. He was dealing with a human being with a will of his own, but he was ready to greet his son if he returned. In the same way, God's love is constant and patient and welcoming. He will search for us and give us the opportunity to respond, but He will not force us to come to Him. Like the father in this story, God waits patiently for us to come to our senses.
