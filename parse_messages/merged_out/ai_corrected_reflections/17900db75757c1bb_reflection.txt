Whatever the idol—it cannot deliver—it lets people down. Fulfillment comes only from worshiping and serving the Lord our God. He is our highest good. In Jesus Christ, His Son, He imparts His saving love to us, accepting us as His redeemed children and heirs. We have what no money can ever buy: peace with our heavenly Father, purpose in life, and the assurance of eternal life with Him.
