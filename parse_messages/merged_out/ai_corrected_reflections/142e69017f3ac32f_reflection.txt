When David said, "My future is in Your hands," he was expressing his belief that all of his life's circumstances were under God's control. Knowing that God loves and cares for us enables us to keep steady in our faith regardless of our circumstances. It keeps us from sinning foolishly by taking matters into our own hands or resenting God's timetable.
