I think that we have all heard of people who have millions of dollars and then lost everything. Even the average person can spend an inheritance or a paycheck with lightning speed and have little to show for it. Don't spend your time chasing fleeting earthly treasures. Instead, store up treasure in heaven, for such treasures will never be lost. (read Luke 12:33, 34 for Jesus' teaching.)
