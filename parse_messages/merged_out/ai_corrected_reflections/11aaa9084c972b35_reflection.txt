When we are strong in abilities or resources, we are tempted to do God's work on our own, and that can lead to pride. When we are weak, allowing God to fill us with His power, then we are stronger than we could ever be on our own. God does not intend for us to be weak, passive, or ineffectual. Life provides enough hindrance and setbacks without us creating them. When those obstacles come, we must depend on God. Only His power will make us effective for Him.
