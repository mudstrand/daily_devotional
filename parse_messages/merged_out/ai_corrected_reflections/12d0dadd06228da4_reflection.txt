Even though our first picture of Jesus is as a baby in a manger, it must not be our last. The Christ Child in the manger has been the subject of a beautiful Christmas scene, but we should not leave Him there. This tiny, helpless baby lived an amazing life, died for us, ascended to heaven, and will come back to earth as King of kings. Christ will rule the world and judge all people according to their decisions about Him. Do you still picture Jesus as a baby in a manger? Is He your Lord? Make sure you don't underestimate Jesus. Let Him grow up in your life.
