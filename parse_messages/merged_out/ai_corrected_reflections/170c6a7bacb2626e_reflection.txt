When you feel down, you may find it difficult to give thanks. But take heart—in all things God works for our good if we love him and are called by him (Romans 8:28). Thank God not for your problems, but for the strength he is building in you through the difficult experiences in your life. You can be sure that God's perfect love will see you through.
