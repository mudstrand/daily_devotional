The apostle John wrote these words to believers as an encouragement. He went on to say, "Anyone who loves their brother and sister lives in the light, and there is nothing in them to make them stumble." (vs. 10). By contrast, he equated hating people with roaming around in darkness. Hatred is disorienting; it takes away our sense of moral direction. When we choose love instead of hate, we are showing our relationship to Christ and reflecting his radiance to the world around us. God is light.
