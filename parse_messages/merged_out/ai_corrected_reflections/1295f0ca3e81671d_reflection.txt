Let us never forget that the Good News of the Bible is simply: "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved." We see this repeated in (Romans 10:9; I Corinthians 12:3; Ephesians 2:8, 9; Philippians 2:11; Acts 16:31). When we recognize Jesus as Lord and trust in Him with our entire life, salvation is assured to us. If you have never trusted in Jesus to save you, do so quickly.
