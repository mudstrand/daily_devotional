Yes, Jesus gave Himself as a sacrifice for our sins. In the Old Testament times, animal sacrifices were continually offered at the temple. The sacrifices showed the Israelites the seriousness of sin. Blood had to be shed before sins could be pardoned. The animal sacrifice could not really remove sin. These sacrifices could only point to Jesus' sacrifice, which paid the penalty for all sins.
