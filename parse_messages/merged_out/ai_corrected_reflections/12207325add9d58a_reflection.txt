When a person dies to the old life and accepts Christ as Savior, a new life begins. It is quite the opposite with an unbeliever. Their life is centered on self-gratification. Those who don't follow Christ have only their own self-determination as their source of power. But by contrast, God is at the center of a Christian's life. God supplies the power for a Christian's daily life. Believers find that their whole way of looking at the world changes when they come to Christ.
