I don't think I have to remind you of this fact that there is evil and corruption in the place where there should be justice. It even affects the legal system. Solomon asked how God's plan can be perfect when there is so much injustice and oppression in the world (4:1). He concluded that God does not ignore injustice but will bring it to an end at His appointed time (12:13, 14).
