When authorities are unjust, upright people are afraid. In these verses, Paul is talking about authorities who are doing their duty. When these officials are just, people who are doing right have nothing to fear. Christians understand Romans 13 in different ways. All Christians agree that we are to live at peace with the state as long as the state allows us to live by our religious convictions. Let us not forget God has placed our country's leaders in charge of keeping peace in the country. Oh yes, the country has had some corrupt leaders because they have allowed Satan to corrupt them.
