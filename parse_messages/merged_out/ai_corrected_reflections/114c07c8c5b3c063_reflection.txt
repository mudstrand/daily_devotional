The power of sin over us died with Christ on the cross. Our "old sinful selves," our sinful nature, died once and for all, so we are freed from its power. The "power of sin" refers to our rebellious, sin-loving nature inherited from Adam. Though we often willingly cooperate with our sinful nature, it is not us but the sin in us that is evil. And it is this power of sin at work in our life that has been defeated. Paul has already stated that through faith in Christ, we stand acquitted, "not guilty" before God. Here, Paul emphasizes that we need no longer live under sin's power. In our old life, we were slaves to sin; now, we can choose to live for Christ.
