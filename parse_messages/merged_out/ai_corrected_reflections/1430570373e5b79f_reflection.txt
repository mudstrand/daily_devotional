People from every nation are praising God before His throne. God's message of salvation and eternal life is not limited to a specific culture, race, or country. Anyone who comes to God in repentance and faith is accepted by Him and will be part of His kingdom. Don't allow prejudice or bias to keep you from sharing Christ with others. Christ welcomes all people who come believing into His kingdom.
