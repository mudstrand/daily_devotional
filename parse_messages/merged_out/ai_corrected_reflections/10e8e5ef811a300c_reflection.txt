Even while He was dying on the cross, Jesus was concerned about His family. He instructed John to care for Mary, His mother. Our families are precious gifts from God, and we should value and care for them under all circumstances. Neither Christian work nor key responsibilities in any job or position excuse us from caring for our families. As you finish your morning devotion, take some time to plan something special that you can do for your family today.
