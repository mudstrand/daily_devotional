With our redemption completed, down to the crossing of every "t" and the dotting of every "i," the prophet points out that there is more. As our Good Shepherd, Jesus continues to look after us, interceding for us and sending forth His ministers. Isaiah stated it well: "He tends His flock like a shepherd: He gathers the lambs in His arms and carries them close to His heart: He gently leads those that have young" (Isaiah 40:11). All glory be to Christ!
