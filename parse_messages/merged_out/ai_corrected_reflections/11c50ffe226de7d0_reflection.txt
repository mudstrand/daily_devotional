God was not intentionally keeping His plan secret, but His plan for the world could not be fully understood until Christ rose from the dead. His purpose for sending Christ was to unite Jews and Gentiles in one body with Christ as the head. Many people still do not understand God's plan, but at the right time, He will bring us together to be with Him forever. Then everyone will understand. On that day, all people will bow to Jesus as Lord, either because they love Him or because they fear His power (see Philippians 2:10, 11).
