Jesus has promised an eternal home to those who become one with Him. A place where we can live within His eternal glory forever. A place where no one can harm us. A place where no one can steal us from the safety of His hand. We have been adopted into a kingdom beyond anything we have ever dreamed possible, where hope and power and love reign. And we need never go hungry or fear again.
