SPIRIT "The breath of life" God breathed into Adam's nostrils, distinguishing humankind from all other creatures (Genesis 2:7). It penetrates and energizes every human faculty. God judges the heart and knows who are His. It is a terrible prospect for God to look at our hearts, considering what lies within.
