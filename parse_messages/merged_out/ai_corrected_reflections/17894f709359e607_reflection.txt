Jesus was the greatest servant who ever lived. When we think of our relationship to Christ, can it be said of us that we want only to serve him? As a well-known missionary returned to the U.S., a reporter asked, "Have you found happiness in Africa?" The missionary answered, "I have found a place of service, and that is enough for anyone." I believe many of us need to do some serious thinking and praying about this matter of being a servant.
