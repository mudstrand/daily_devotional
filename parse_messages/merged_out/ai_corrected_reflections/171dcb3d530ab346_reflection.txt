This is truly a "testing of our faith"; I say this because it calls us to believe in the goodness of God, and to trust that He is not only willing but able to accomplish His purpose, no matter what befalls us. Any difficulty, whether great or small, is an occasion for joy, but only when we remind ourselves of the nature of the God who loves us and wills only the best for us. Think about your hardest struggle. Thank Jesus that He will use it to strengthen your faith.
