Sometimes, no amount of treatments or therapies can help us as much as the promise of heaven and the hope we receive through Jesus. A whole world of light and life awaits us, beyond what we can see. When earthly forms of medicine fail, we can turn to the Great Physician for help. He'll never leave or disappoint you. We only need to trust Jesus and be patient.
