The reason Paul called the Corinthians infants in the Christian life is because they were not yet spiritually healthy and mature. The proof was in their quarreling like children, allowing differences to distract them. When we are controlled by our own desires, we are acting immaturely. Mature believers are in tune with God's desires. We need to examine ourselves and ask, "How much influence do my desires have on my life?" Our desires should be to let God's desires be ours. Being controlled by our own desires will stunt our spiritual growth.
