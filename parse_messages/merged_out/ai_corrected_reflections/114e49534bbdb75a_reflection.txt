YES_CHANGES_NEEDED

Yes, we are free to choose between two masters: sin or Christ Jesus. BUT the wages of sin is eternal death. That is all you can expect or hope for in a life without God. By choosing Christ as your master, you receive His gift of eternal life—new life with God that begins on earth and continues forever with God. What choice have you made??? We need to remember, eternal life is a gift from God. AND if it is a gift, then it is not something that we can earn, nor something that must be paid for. Consider the foolishness of someone who receives a gift given out of love and then offers to pay for it. A gift cannot be purchased by the recipient. A more appropriate response to a loved one who offers a gift is graceful acceptance with gratitude.
