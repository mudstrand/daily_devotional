How much thought do we put into the fact that we are bombarded every day with relentless appeals to go in various directions? TV advertising alone places hundreds of options before us, in addition to appeals from political parties, cults, false religions, and dozens of other groups. Numerous organizations, including Christian organizations, seek to motivate us to support a cause. Add to that dozens of decisions we must make concerning our job, our family, our money, and our society, and we become desperate for someone to show us the right way. If you find yourself pulled in several directions, remember that God teaches the humble way, His way.
