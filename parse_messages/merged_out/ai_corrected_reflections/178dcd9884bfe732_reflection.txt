The peace of God is guaranteed to affect those who accept it in faith. First, it brings inner peace to the individual. Further, those who are justified by faith, and thus, are at peace with God through Christ, may live in peace with one another and be an influence for good. God works through them in promoting peaceful relations in community, country, and the world at large.
