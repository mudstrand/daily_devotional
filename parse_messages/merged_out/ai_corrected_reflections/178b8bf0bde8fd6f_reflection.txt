What does it mean for us to be found by God? Unlike our first parents hiding in the bushes, we are found in our homes, communities, and churches, gladly doing God's will and serving the least of Christ's people. We do not hide, for our conscience is at rest. We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
