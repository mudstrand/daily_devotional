I have said it before, and I'll say it again: We must get rid of the plague of the spirit of this religious age in which we live. In our Lord's life here on earth, there was none of the pressures and the rushing of tremendous activity that we regard so highly today, and a disciple (believer) is to be like his Master. The central point of the kingdom of Jesus Christ is a personal relationship with Him, not public usefulness to others. We need to spend more time submerging ourselves in His Word so that we become rooted and grounded in Him; then, we will remain true to Him whatever happens.
