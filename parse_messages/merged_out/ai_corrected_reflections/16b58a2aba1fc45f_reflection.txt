Sometimes it doesn't take much to get us down, does it? Yes, life can seem unbearable at times. But let us not let circumstances keep us down. We need to meditate on God's goodness to us and talk to Him. Knowing that He loves us and "accepts our prayer" (Psalm 6:9) will give us strength to help us get up when we're down. When things are looking down, try looking up.
