CORRECTIONS_NEEDED As a zealous Pharisee, Paul had been an enemy of the Christian Church, even to the point of capturing and persecuting believers (see Acts 9:1-3). So he felt unworthy to be called an apostle of Christ. But it goes without saying that he did become the most influential of the apostles. Paul was deeply humble—he knew that he had worked hard and had accomplished much but only because God had poured kindness and grace upon him. True humility is not convincing yourself that you are worthless but recognizing God's work in you. It is having God's perspective on who you are and acknowledging His grace in developing your abilities.
