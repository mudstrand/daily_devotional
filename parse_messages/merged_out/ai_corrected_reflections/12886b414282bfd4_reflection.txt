This "manna that has been hidden away in Heaven" suggests the spiritual nourishment that the faithful believers will receive. As the believers traveled toward the Promised Land, God provided manna from heaven for their physical nourishment (Exodus 16:13-18). Jesus is the bread of life (John 6:51); He provides spiritual nourishment that satisfies our deepest hunger. The stones are significant because each will bear the new name of every person who truly believes in Christ. They are the evidence that a person has been accepted by God and declared worthy to receive eternal life.
