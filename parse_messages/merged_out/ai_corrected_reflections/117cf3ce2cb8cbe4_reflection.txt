Slavery was a common thing throughout the Roman Empire. Some Christians in the Corinthian church were very likely slaves. Paul said that even though they were slaves to other human beings, they were free from the power of sin in their lives. People today are slaves to sin until they commit their lives to Christ, who alone can conquer sin's power. Sin, pride, and fear no longer have any claim on us, just as a slave owner no longer has power over the slave he has sold. The Bible tells us we become Christ's slaves when we become Christians, but this actually means we gain our freedom, because sin no longer controls us.
