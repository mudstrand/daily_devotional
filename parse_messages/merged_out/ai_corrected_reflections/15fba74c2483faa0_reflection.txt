Being "blessed with every spiritual blessing" means that in Christ we have all the blessings of knowing God. Those blessings include: being chosen for salvation, being adopted as God's children, insight, forgiveness, the gifts of the Spirit, the power to do God's will, the hope of living forever with Christ. Because we have an intimate relationship with Christ, we can enjoy these blessings now.
