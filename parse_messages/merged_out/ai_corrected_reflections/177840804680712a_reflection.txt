We do well to follow those who appreciate it when others sincerely and truthfully call their attention to spiritual shortcomings. It helps us to arrive at a proper self-evaluation. It is critical that we see ourselves as forgiven people having God's full approval for Jesus' sake. This is, in Robert Burns' expression, a "giftie" only God can give. "It is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God." (Ephesians 2:8)
