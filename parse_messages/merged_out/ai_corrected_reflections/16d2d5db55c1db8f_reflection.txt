This Old Testament book teaches that the sin of hatred will not go unpunished. History alone has made that clear. Not hatred but love—to God and to others—is to be a part of our daily lives. We are enabled to love because God first loved us. To prove that love, God sent His own Son to atone for our sins and to prepare the way for us to follow Him to eternal life. Ask God for an outpouring of love into your heart for others.
