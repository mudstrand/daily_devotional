Sometimes God intervenes and stops evil-doers in their tracks in order to protect His followers. At other times, for reasons known only to Him, God allows evil to continue even though innocent people are hurt. It is during these times that we must ask God to protect us. Remember that God will execute final justice, although it may not be during our lifetime.
