To walk in the woods at night, we need a light so we don't trip over tree roots or stumble into some hole. In this life, we are really walking through a dark forest of evil. But the Bible can be our light to show us a safe path so we won't stumble as we walk. It reveals to us the entangling roots of false values and philosophies. Let us remember to study the Bible so we will be able to see our way clear enough to stay on the right path.
