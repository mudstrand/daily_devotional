Although God did not remove Paul's affliction, He promised to demonstrate His power in Paul. The fact that God's power is displayed in our weakness should give us courage and hope. As we recognize our limitations, we will depend more on God for our effectiveness rather than our own energy, effort, or talent. If we swallow our pride, we would realize that our limitations not only help us develop Christian character but also deepen our worship, because in admitting our weaknesses, we affirm God's strength.
