In the realm of spiritual beliefs, truth is even more precious. God reveals His truth abundantly in His Word, and He broadcasts it in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. But people are preoccupied with self-centered pursuits. They have not tuned in. Both their reception and their perception leave much to be desired. Because this has been true since the fall into sin, God sent His truth to earth in the person of Jesus Christ.
