Christ's resurrection was foretold: "After the suffering of His soul, He will see the light of life" (Isaiah 53:11). Jesus told His disciples that He would rise again on the third day. But the dire prediction—as well as the promise of His triumphant resurrection—was beyond the disciples' understanding. When we look at what our Lord and Savior accomplished to give us time and eternity, it is always springtime in our souls.
