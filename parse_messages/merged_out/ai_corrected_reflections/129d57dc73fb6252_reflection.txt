Not only does the gospel tell me the good news, it is also God's power to bring me to faith. The gospel is both God's message and God's means. Our gracious God uses it like some stick of dynamite to blast open my stony heart of unbelief, to convert that heart into a home for my Savior, and keep my heart in faith in His Son as my only Savior. The Gospel is far more powerful than dynamite. The Lord gave me, a sinner, something far more powerful in His gospel.
