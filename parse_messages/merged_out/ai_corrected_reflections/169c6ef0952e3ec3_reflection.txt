The word Gethsemane means "place of the olive press," and that perfectly describes those first crushing hours of Christ's suffering on our behalf. There, "in anguish, He prayed, and His sweat was like drops of blood" (Luke 22:44). Jesus suffered and died "to take away the sins of the world" (John 1:29). In so doing, He restored our broken relationship with the Father. Gone my transgressions, and now I am free—all because Jesus was wounded for me.
