As a believer, we need to learn that we are not left to our own resources to cope with the problems of life. (Thank God!) Even when we do not know the right words to pray, the Holy Spirit prays with and for us, and God answers. With God's Spirit helping us pray, we need not be afraid to come before Him. Merely ask the Holy Spirit to intercede for you in harmony with God's own will. Then, when you bring your requests before God, trust that He will always do what is best.
