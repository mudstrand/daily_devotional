John the Baptist called people to more than words or rituals; he told them to change their behavior. "Prove by the way you live that you have really turned from your sins" means that God looks beyond words and religious activities to see if our conduct backs up what we say, and He judges our words by our actions that accompany them. Do your actions match your words?
