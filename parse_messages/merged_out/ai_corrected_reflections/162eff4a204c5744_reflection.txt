The words "set up" here are referring to Wisdom begotten of God. For Christ was appointed Messiah before the creation of the world. In (John 17:5), Jesus refers to this statement when He says: "Now, Father, bring me into the glory we shared before the world began." Before Jesus came to earth, He was ONE with God. At this point, Jesus was asking His Father to restore Him to His original place of honor.
