Our Lord leads us in the right direction. He, conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary, declares, "What God has joined together, let no man separate" (Matthew 19:6). God guides us, urging us to do His will. Husbands and wives, loving and serving one another, are a portrait of Christ loving the church and giving up His life for her. Let us pray that God, for Jesus' sake, may help us to always regard marriage as honorable. No marriage so honored is accidental.
