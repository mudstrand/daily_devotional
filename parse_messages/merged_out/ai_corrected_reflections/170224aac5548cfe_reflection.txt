There have been times I have struggled with taking ownership of my mistakes, until Jesus convinced me to own up to them. Facing the truth that I was at fault wasn't easy. Taking the step to take ownership of my struggle helped me understand other areas in my life, and it put me on the path to transformation and freedom. Do you make excuses or blame others to avoid taking responsibility?
