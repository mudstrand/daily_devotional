"Who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms" means that in Christ we have all the benefits of knowing God, being chosen for salvation, being adopted as His children, forgiveness, insight, the gifts of the Spirit, power to do God's will, and the hope of living forever with Christ. If we have an intimate relationship with Christ, we can enjoy these blessings now. The "heavenly realms" means these blessings are eternal, not temporal. These blessings come from Christ's spiritual realm.
