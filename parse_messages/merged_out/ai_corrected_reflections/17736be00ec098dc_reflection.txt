By faith in the redeeming work of Christ Jesus, we are at peace with God, who is our heavenly Father, and we are His sons and daughters. As God's children, we are brothers and sisters to one another and strive to live at peace. The Psalmist declares, "How good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in unity!" (Psalm 133:1). Whenever we cross a bridge, we can be reminded that through our spiritual bridge, we are one with God and with one another.
