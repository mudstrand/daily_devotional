Losing a friend (this may be a family member) is a wake-up call, a chance to assess where we've been and where we're headed. Sometimes it's a source of joy as we discover the wisdom in another's life. Learning how they used the gifts the Lord gave them—their time, their money, and their hearts—changes us. We should want to live as Jesus did, sharing all, sparing nothing. How can you influence others with your love?
