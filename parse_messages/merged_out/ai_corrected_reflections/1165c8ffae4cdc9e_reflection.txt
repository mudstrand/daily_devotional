Somehow, many of us have gotten the idea that self-love is wrong. But if this were the case, it would be pointless to love our neighbor as ourselves. But Paul explains what he means by self-love. Even if you have low self-esteem, you probably don't willingly let yourself go hungry. You take care of your body and may even exercise. You clothe yourself reasonably well. You make sure there is a roof over your head. You try not to let yourself be cheated or injured. This is the kind of love we need to have for our neighbors. Do we see that others are fed, clothed, and housed as well as they can be? Are we concerned about issues of social justice? Loving others as ourselves means actively working to see that their needs are met. It is interesting that people who focus on others rather than themselves rarely suffer from low self-esteem.
