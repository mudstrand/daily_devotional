This verse points to the danger of the Hebrew Christians' returning to Judaism and so committing apostasy. There are those who apply this verse to superficial believers who renounce their Christianity or to unbelievers who come close to salvation and then turn away. Either way, those who reject Christ will not be saved. Christ died once for all. He will not be crucified again. Apart from His cross, there is no other possible way of salvation. The author is warning against the hardness of heart that would make repentance inconceivable for the sinner.
