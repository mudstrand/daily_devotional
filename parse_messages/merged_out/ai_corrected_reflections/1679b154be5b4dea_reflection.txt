God often chooses to move through our prayers to accomplish His work. God wants us to join Him in His work through humble, persistent prayers. When we make it our aim to serve God through praying faithfully, we are taking part in a beautiful privilege where at any moment we may be given the privilege of being a part of a miracle. Great faith on our part honors God.
