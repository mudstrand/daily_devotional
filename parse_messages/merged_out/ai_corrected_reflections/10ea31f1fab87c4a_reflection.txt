The graphic details of Jesus' death are especially important in John's record because he was an eyewitness. Jesus died as the lambs for the Passover meal were being slain. Not a bone was to be broken in these sacrificial lambs, as we see in Exodus 12:46. Jesus, the Lamb of God, was the perfect sacrifice for the sins of the whole world.
