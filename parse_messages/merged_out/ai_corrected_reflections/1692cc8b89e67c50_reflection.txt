When we experience tragedy, we may wonder about God's goodness. Is God always good? Yes, He is! He doesn't promise that bad things will never happen to us, but He does promise to be "our refuge and strength." (Psalm 46:1) God is good—no matter what suffering we are experiencing. God tests our faith so we may trust His faithfulness.
