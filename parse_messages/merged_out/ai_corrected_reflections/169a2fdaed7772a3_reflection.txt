Our life on earth is like the pre-game in basketball. Life is interesting and full of promise, but it doesn't compare to what lies ahead. Just think of the pleasure of knowing that when life is good, the best is yet to come! Or that when we give cheerfully to those in need, it's an investment in heavenly treasure. In times of suffering and sorrow, we can find hope as we reflect on the truth that a pain-free, tireless eternity awaits us. Living for the future puts today in perspective.
