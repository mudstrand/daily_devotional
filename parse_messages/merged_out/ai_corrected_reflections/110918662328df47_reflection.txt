Christ was always morally perfect. By obeying, He demonstrated His perfection to us, not to God or to Himself. In the Bible, perfection usually means completeness or maturity. By sharing our experience of suffering, Christ shared our human experience completely. He is now able to offer eternal salvation to those who obey Him. Look to Philippians 2:5-11, and you will see Christ's attitude as He took on human form.
