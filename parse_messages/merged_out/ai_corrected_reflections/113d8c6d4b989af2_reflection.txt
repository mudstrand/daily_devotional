Paul exposes his opponents by their own judgments. He is presenting his argument like this: "The very fact that you slander me as teaching that we may do evil that good may come from it, proves that you know evil has no defense even though God is able to make good come from it." Unrighteousness remains sinful. Man defies God by it and transgresses His holy will. Planning deliberately to do evil in order to bring about good would be an attempt to justify crime.
