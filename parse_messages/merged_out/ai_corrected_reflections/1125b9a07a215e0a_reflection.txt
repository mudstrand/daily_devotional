Paul is quite bold in his declaration of the greatness and certainty of his message. He claims a commission from God to deliver a message, "the gospel concerning His Son." Paul's emphasis is that God sent His Son into the world to redeem mankind otherwise lost because of sin. Matthew also declared this in reviewing the genealogy of Jesus in (Matthew 1:1-17). It is also John's premise when he declared that Jesus, the Word "became flesh and dwelt among us" (John 1:14). Is this difficult for you to believe? YES! Christ became incarnate to redeem those who would believe in Him. Because of this there are millions both in this life and in eternity who raise their songs in praise to His saving grace.
