Keeping a record of sins (or holding a grudge) is like building a wall between you and another person, which makes it nearly impossible to talk openly while the wall is there. God doesn't keep a record of our sins; when He forgives, He forgives completely, tearing down any wall between Him and us. So, we fear (revere) God, making it possible to talk to Him about anything. When you pray, realize God is holding nothing against you. His lines of communication are completely open.
