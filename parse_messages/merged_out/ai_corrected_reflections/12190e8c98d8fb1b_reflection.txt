This subject calls us once again to think of all the believers throughout the world, but leads us to view them from a different standpoint. If we are to ask God to increase the number and the power of those who do pray, we shall be led to form some impression of what the hope is that our circle of intercessors may gradually increase in number and power. This message is sent out like radio waves to all who desire to be in touch with it and to seek to prove their consecration to the Lord in the unceasing daily supplication for the Power of His love and Spirit to be revealed to all His people.
