The shortness of life is the theme throughout the books of Psalms, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes. Remember, Jesus also spoke about this subject in Luke 12:20. Now, isn't it funny how people spend so much time securing their lives on earth but take little time or thought about where they will spend eternity? David realized that putting together riches and busily accomplishing worldly tasks would make no difference in eternity. It seems that very few people understand that their only hope is in the Lord.
