The Pharisee who asked this question was attempting to stump Jesus. But Jesus reminded the Pharisee, and He reminds us, that when we feel overwhelmed by commands and rules, we can come back to the core truth. Our God wants to be in a relationship with us. Because of Jesus, that relationship is restored. We never go wrong when we pour our hearts, souls, and minds into love for our Lord. Jesus said, "This is the greatest command."
