As Christians, we should expect continuing tension with an unbelieving world that is "out of sync" with Christ, His Good News, and His people. But we can take courage because He will not abandon us. We can expect our relationship with Christ to produce peace and comfort because we are "in sync" with Him. Let us remember the ultimate victory has already been won; we can claim the peace of Christ in the most troublesome times.
