Have you ever grown tired of praying for something or someone? Paul says we should "devote" ourselves to prayer and be "alert" in prayer. Our persistence is an expression of our faith that God answers prayers. Faith shouldn't die if the answers come slowly, for the delay may be God's way of working His will in our life. When you feel tired of praying, know that God is present, always listening, always answering—maybe not in ways you hoped, but in ways that He knows are best.
