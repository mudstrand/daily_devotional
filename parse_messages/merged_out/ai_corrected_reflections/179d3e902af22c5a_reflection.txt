When things go wrong, we tend to grumble and blame others for our miseries. Blaming others is easier than owning our share of the responsibility; it can be both destructive and sinful. Before you blame others for their shortcomings, remember that Christ the Judge will come to evaluate each of us. (Matthew 7:1-5)
