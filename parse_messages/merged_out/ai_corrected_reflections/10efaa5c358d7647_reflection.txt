Some people think they would believe in Jesus if they could see a definite sign or a miracle. But Jesus says we are blessed if we can believe without seeing. Really, we have all the proof we need in the words of the Bible and the testimony of believers. A physical appearance would not make Jesus any more real to us than He is now.
