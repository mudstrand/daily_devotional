Many in Jesus' day believed that He came for the Jews only. But when Jesus said, "All those who want to be my disciples must come and follow me," He was also talking to these Greeks as well. No matter who the sincere seekers are, Jesus welcomes them. His message is for everyone. Let us not allow social or racial differences to become barriers to the Good News. Let us remember to share the Good News with all people.
