The East and West can never meet. This is a symbolic portrait of God's forgiveness. When He forgives our sin, He separates it from us and doesn't even remember it. We need not wallow in the ugly past, because God forgives and forgets. How often have we dredged up the past? But why, remember God has wiped our record clean. If we intend to follow God, we must model His forgiveness. When we forgive others, we must also forget the sin; otherwise, we have not truly forgiven.
