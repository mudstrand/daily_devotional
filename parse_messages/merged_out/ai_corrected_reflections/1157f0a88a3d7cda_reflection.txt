Here is the corrected text:

Here is what we should learn from these verses: We see that Paul expresses concern for his Jewish "brothers and sisters" by saying that he would willingly take their punishment if that would save them. Now we need to remember, Christ is the only one who can save us. Paul shared a rare depth of love. Like Jesus, he was willing to sacrifice so others would be saved. How concerned are you for those who do not know Christ? Are you willing to sacrifice your time, money, energy, comfort, and safety to see them come to faith in Jesus?
