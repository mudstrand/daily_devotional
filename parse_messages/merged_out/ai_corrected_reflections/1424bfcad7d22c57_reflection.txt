When we allow God, our Shepherd, to guide us, we have contentment. When we choose to sin and go our own way, we cannot blame God for the environment we have created for ourselves. Our Shepherd knows the "green meadows" and "peaceful streams" that will restore us. We will reach these places only by following Him obediently. Rebelling against the Shepherd's leading is actually rebelling against our own best interests. We must remember this the next time we are tempted to go our own way rather than the Shepherd's way.
