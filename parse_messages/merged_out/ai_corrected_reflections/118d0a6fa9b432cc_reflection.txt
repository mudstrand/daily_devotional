There will always be people who say that Jesus didn't rise from the dead. But Paul assures us that many people saw Jesus after His resurrection: In verse 5 and following, Paul says, Peter, the disciples (the twelve), and more than 500 Christian believers saw Him. The Resurrection is a historical fact. Don't be discouraged by doubters who deny the Resurrection. Be filled with hope because of the knowledge that one day you and they will see the living proof when Christ returns.
