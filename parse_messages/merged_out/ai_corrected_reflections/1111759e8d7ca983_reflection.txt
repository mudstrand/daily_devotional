Among references to priests, tabernacles, sacrifices, and other ideas unfamiliar to us, we come to this description of Christ as our Advocate, appearing in God's presence on our behalf. We can relate to this role and be encouraged by it. Christ is on our side at God's side. He is our Lord and Savior. He is not there to convince or remind God that our sins are forgiven but to present both our needs and our service for Him as an offering. (see Hebrews 7:25).
