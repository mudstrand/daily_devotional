Solomon warns his readers about making foolish promises to God. In Israelite culture, making vows was a serious matter. It is foolish to make a vow you cannot keep or to play games with God by only partially fulfilling your vow. (Proverbs 20:25) It is better not to vow than to make a vow to God and break it. If you make a vow, keep it. (Matthew 5:33ff)
