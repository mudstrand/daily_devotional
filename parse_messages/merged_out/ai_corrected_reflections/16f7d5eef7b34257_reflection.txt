As believers, we should consider ourselves dead and unresponsive to sexual immorality, impurity, lust, shameful desires, and greed. We must make a conscious, daily decision to remove anything that supports or feeds these desires and to rely on the Holy Spirit's power. Let us pray for the Holy Spirit's power to help us discard our sinful attitudes and behaviors.
