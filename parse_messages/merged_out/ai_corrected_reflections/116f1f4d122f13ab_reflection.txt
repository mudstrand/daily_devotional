Paul had planted the Good News in the people's hearts. He was a missionary pioneer; he brought the message of salvation. Apollos watered the seed. He helped the believers grow stronger in the faith. Paul founded the church in Corinth, and Apollos built on that foundation. Tragically, the believers in Corinth had split into different factions, pledging loyalty to different teachers. After the preachers' work is done, God is the one who makes Christians grow. Our leaders should be respected, but we should never place them on a pedestal that creates barriers between people or set them up as a substitute for Christ.
