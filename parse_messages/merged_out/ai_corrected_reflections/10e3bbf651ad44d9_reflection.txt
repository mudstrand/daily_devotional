Jesus didn't ask the Father to take believers out of the world, but instead to use them in the world. Because Jesus gives us the command to go out into the world, we should not try to escape from the world, nor should we avoid all relationships with non-Christians. We are called to be the salt and light (Matthew 5:13-16), and we are to do the work that God sent us to do. One of His greatest wishes is that we would be truly sanctified, in other words, made truly holy.
