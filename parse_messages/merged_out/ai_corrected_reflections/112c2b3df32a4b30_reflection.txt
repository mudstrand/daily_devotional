Paul aims his words at the self-deception of supposing that one can deceive God. The Jews reassured themselves on the conclusion that they were children of Abraham, God's covenant people. But they would not admit that they disregarded the will of God as revealed in the law. There is a comparison that may be made similarly to nominal Christians who follow outward practices of the church, though their lives indicate defiance of God's ways. They hope to gain eternal life without repentance and the new birth which God offers.
