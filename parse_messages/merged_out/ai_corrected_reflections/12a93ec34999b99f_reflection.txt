Jesus began his sermon with words that seem to contradict each other. But God's way of living usually contradicts the world's. If you want to live for God, you must be ready to say and do what seems strange to the world. You must be willing to give when others take, to love when others hate, to help when others abuse. Being "poor in spirit" means giving up our own rights in order to serve others, in so doing we will one day receive everything God has in store for us.
