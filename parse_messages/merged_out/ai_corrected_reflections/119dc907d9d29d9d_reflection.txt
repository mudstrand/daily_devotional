While eternal life is a gift given on the basis of God's grace (Ephesians 2:8, 9), each of us will still be judged by Christ. He will reward us for how we have lived. God's gracious gift of salvation does not free us from the requirement of faithful obedience. All Christians must give an account on the day of judgment of how they have lived ~ Matthew 16:27 ~ Romans 14:10-12 ~ 1 Corinthians 3:10-15.
