These verses assume there will be differences of opinion in the church about what is right and wrong. Paul says we are not to quarrel about issues that are on matters of opinion. Differences should not be feared or avoided but accepted and handled with love. Do not expect everyone, even in the best possible church, to agree on every subject. Through sharing ideas, we can come to a fuller understanding of what the Bible teaches. Accept, listen to, and respect others. Differences of opinion need not cause divisions. They can be a source of learning and riches in our relationships.
