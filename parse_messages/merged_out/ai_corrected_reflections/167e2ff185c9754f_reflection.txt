The joy was not for a few people, but for all people. "For God so loved the whole world that He gave His one and only Son." (John 3:16) As we share the life-changing message of Jesus with others, we need to join the worldwide chorus in proclaiming, "The glories of His righteousness and the wonders of His love." The good news of Jesus's birth is a source of joy for all people.
