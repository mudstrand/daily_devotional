What we should always remember is that the Jews are God's chosen people. The Jews viewed God's choosing of Israel in the Old Testament as being like adoption. They were undeserving and without rights as natural children. Yet God adopted them and granted them the status of His sons and daughters. But let's also remember (2 Corinthians 5:17, 18) "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, and the new has come! All this is from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation." Those who accept Christ and become Christians have become new people on the inside. The Holy Spirit gives them new life, and they are not the same anymore. They are recreated (new creations) living in vital union with Christ (Col. 2:6, 7).
