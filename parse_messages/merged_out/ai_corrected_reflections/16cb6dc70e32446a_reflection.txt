The psalmist said that he is a "foreigner here on earth" and so he needed guidance. Almost any long trip needs a map or a guide. As we travel through life, the Bible should be our road map, pointing out safe routes and obstacles to avoid and our final destination. We must recognize ourselves as pilgrims, travelers here on earth who need to study God's map to learn the way. If we ignore the map, we will wander aimlessly through life and risk missing our real destination.
