This is why I have to confess that I have a problem with the Lord's Prayer! I can no longer pray "lead us not into temptation." I now pray, "Do not allow us to be led into temptation by Satan." I do believe a lot of people who live for God often wonder why they still have temptations. Does God tempt them? God tests people, but He does not tempt them by trying to seduce them to sin. However, God does allow Satan to tempt people, in order to refine their faith and to help them grow in their dependence upon Christ. We can resist the temptation to sin by turning to God for strength and by choosing to obey His Word.
