True joy is far deeper than happiness; we can feel joy, in spite of our deepest troubles. Happiness is temporary because it is based on external circumstances, but joy is lasting because it is based on God's presence, within us. As we contemplate His daily presence, we will find contentment. Don't base your life on circumstances, but on God!
