During times of great evil and injustice, David was grateful that God is just and faithful. When we wonder if anyone is honest and fair, we can be assured that God will continue to bring justice and fairness when we involve Him in our activities. If you ever feel that you are being treated unfairly, ask the One who is always fair and just to be with you. Then thank Him for His presence.
