Happiness is not found in the pursuit of happiness. Life is not found in the pursuit of life. Both are found in the pursuit of God and His righteousness. Don't be fooled, the end of our current emphasis on self is not life, but disappointment and ultimately death! If we want to discover true life, then we must pursue the things of God and His Spirit!
