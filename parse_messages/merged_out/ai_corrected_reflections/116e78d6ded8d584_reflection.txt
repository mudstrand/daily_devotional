Paul's words were authoritative because their source was the Holy Spirit. Paul was not merely giving his own personal views or his personal impression of what God had said. Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, he wrote the very thoughts and words of God. People who refuse to believe cannot understand spiritual truths, and they cannot grasp the thought that God's Spirit lives in every believer. Don't expect most people to approve of or understand your decision to follow Christ. It seems so silly to them. The person who rejects Christ cannot understand truths from God's Spirit. The lines of communication have been broken, and so they will not hear what God is saying to them.
