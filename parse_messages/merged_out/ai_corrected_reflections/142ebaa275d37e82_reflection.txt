What David is assuring God's faithful people is that He preserves or keeps His faithful safe. But the Lord despises pride, and so there will be a penalty for them to pay. Living in this world can be stressful, so He says, "Be strong—let your heart take courage." How do we manage that? We can manage that because the Lord preserves His faithful ones. Let us remember vs. 3 of 'Amazing Grace': "Through many dangers, toils and snares, I have already come; 'tis grace hath brought me safe thus far, and grace will lead me home"—and everyone said Amen.
