Thanksgiving should be an integral part of our praise to God. This theme is woven throughout the Psalms. As we praise and thank God for material and spiritual blessings, we should also thank Him for answered prayer. Remember when you asked God for protection, strength, comfort, patience, love, or other special needs, and He supplied them. Beware of taking God's provision and answered prayer for granted.
