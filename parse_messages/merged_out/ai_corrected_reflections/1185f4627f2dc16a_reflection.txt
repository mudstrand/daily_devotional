CORRECTIONS_NEEDED When the Lord's Supper was celebrated in the early church, it included a feast or fellowship meal followed by the celebration of communion. In the church at Corinth, the fellowship meal had become a time when some ate and drank excessively, while others went hungry. There was little sharing and caring. This certainly did not demonstrate the unity and love that should characterize the church, nor was it a preparation for communion. Paul condemned these actions and reminded the church of the real purpose of the Lord's Supper. How do you approach the Lord's Supper? Is it just something that others are doing, so you follow suit? Or do you approach with a repentant heart? Examine your reasoning before you approach God's table next time.
