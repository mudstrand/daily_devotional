Of course, we already know that this was a prediction of Peter's death by crucifixion. Tradition indicates that Peter was crucified for his faith, upside down because he did not feel worthy of dying as his Lord did. Despite what Peter's future held, Jesus told him to follow Him. We may be uncertain and fearful about our future, but if we know God is in control, we can confidently follow Christ.
