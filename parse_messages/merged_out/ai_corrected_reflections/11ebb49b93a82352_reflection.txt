We may come on hard times, but if we remain committed in our Christian walk, God will be there to carry us through the tough times. I would like to share a quote from Reggie White: "The promises made, but not kept; the functions attended, but not experienced; the hopes dreamed, but not put into action -- commitment matters. There is no success for a football player -- or a Christian -- without it. Remember, without commitment, we cannot claim John 14:6: 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.'"
