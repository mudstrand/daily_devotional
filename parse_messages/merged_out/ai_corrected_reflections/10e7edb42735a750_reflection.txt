The Jewish leaders were so desperate to get rid of Jesus that, despite their intense hatred for Rome, they shouted, "We have no king but Caesar." How ironic that they claimed that their allegiance was to Rome, rejecting their own Messiah! Their own words condemned them, for God was to be their only true King, and they had abandoned every trace of loyalty to Him. The priests had truly lost their reason for existence; instead of turning people to God, they claimed allegiance to Rome in order to kill the Messiah.
