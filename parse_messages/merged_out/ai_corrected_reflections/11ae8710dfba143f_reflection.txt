Do you seem to be spending your life pleasing everybody? Paul had to speak harshly to the Christians in Galatia; they were in serious danger. Paul did not apologize for his straightforward words, knowing that they could not serve Christ faithfully if he allowed the Galatian Christians to remain on the wrong track. Whose approval are you seeking - others or God's? Pray for the courage to seek God's approval above anyone else's.
