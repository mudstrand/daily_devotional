It's all about attitude. Someone once said, "My past is gone; my present is passing; my future is arriving." The best thing about the future is that it comes in degrees, a day at a time. We can manage that! Whatever it holds, our future is ours. If it be fair weather, let us bask in the sun; if it be stormy, let us bend with the wind. The future belongs to those who can make adjustments. Keep your mind on God, and receive His promise of perfect peace.
