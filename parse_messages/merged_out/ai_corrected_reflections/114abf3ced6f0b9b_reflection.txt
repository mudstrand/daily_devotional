If God loves to forgive, why not give Him more to forgive? If forgiveness is guaranteed, do we have the freedom to sin as much as we want to? Paul's forceful answer is "Of course not! Such an attitude—deciding ahead of time to take advantage of God—shows that a person does not understand the seriousness of sin. God's forgiveness does not make sin less serious; His Son's death for sin shows us the dreadful seriousness of sin. Jesus paid with His life so that we could be forgiven. The availability of God's mercy must not become an excuse for careless living and moral laziness.
