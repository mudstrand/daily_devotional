YOU CAN HEAR God at any time, but in the above verse King David gives a model for listening and hearing Him in the morning. When you wake, make time to allow God to speak to you. Each day is an opportunity for you to be guided by His instructions, His daily treasure. Heavenly Father, I am here. I am listening.
