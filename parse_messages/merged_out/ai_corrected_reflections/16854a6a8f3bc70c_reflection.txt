In morally corrupt Corinth, love had been a mixed-up term with little meaning. Today, people are still confused about love. Love is the greatest of all human qualities, and it is an attribute of God Himself (1 John 4:8). Love involves unselfish service to others, to give evidence that you care. Faith is the foundation and content of God's message; Hope is the attitude and focus; Love is the action. When faith and hope are in line, you are free to love completely because you understand how God loves.
