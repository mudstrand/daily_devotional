How many times have you heard someone say, or even ourselves, "The devil made me do it." "I didn't do it; the sin within me did it." These sound like good excuses for sin, but we are responsible for our actions. We must never use the power of sin or Satan as an excuse, because they are defeated enemies. Without Christ's help, sin is stronger than we are, and sometimes we are unable to defend ourselves against his attacks. That is why we should not stand up to temptation alone. Jesus Christ, who has conquered sin once for all, promises to fight by our side. If we look to Him for help, we will not have to give in to sin.
