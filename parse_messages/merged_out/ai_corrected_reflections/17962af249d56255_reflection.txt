In the first century, orphans and widows had very little means of economic support. Unless a family member was willing to care for them, they were reduced to begging, selling themselves as slaves, or starving. By caring for these people, the church puts God's Word into practice. When we give with no thought of receiving, we show what it means to truly serve others.
