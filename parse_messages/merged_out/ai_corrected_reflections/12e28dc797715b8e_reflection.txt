God had previously commanded His people to love others, even at some cost, but Jesus' sacrificial love sets a far higher standard than anything before. The disciples cannot follow Christ to the cross, but He asks them to imitate His love for them as they love one another. We, as Christians, bring dishonor to Christ and His love when we deal with one another in a loveless manner. Christ redeemed us through His self-sacrificial love that we may in turn imitate His love.
