The apostle did not give up, but he confidently declared the power of the Gospel in bringing salvation to all who believe. The Word of God points to Jesus Christ as having obediently fulfilled all righteousness for us and as having suffered death on the cross for our redemption. Now we are willing and able to live to the glory of God, always in conformity to his holy will.
