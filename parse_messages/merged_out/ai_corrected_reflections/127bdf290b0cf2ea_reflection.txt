Even while dying on the cross, Jesus was concerned about His family. He instructed John to care for Mary, His mother. Our families are precious gifts from God, and we should value and care for them under all circumstances. Neither Christian work nor key responsibilities in any job or position excuse us from caring for our families. The question we should ask ourselves each day should be, "What can I do today to show my love for my family?"
