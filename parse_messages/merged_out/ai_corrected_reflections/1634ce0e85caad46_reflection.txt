The wicked person dreads death. Those who do not believe in God usually fear death, and with good reason. By contrast, believers desire eternal life and God's salvation. Their hopes will be rewarded. This verse offers a choice. You can have either your fears or your hopes come true. You make that choice by rejecting God and living your own way or by accepting God and following Him.
