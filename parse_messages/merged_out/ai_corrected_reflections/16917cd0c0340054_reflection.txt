In Psalm 37, God is saying, in effect, "Do what's right and trust Me, regardless of how badly you may seem to be losing. Do my will and leave the outcome to me." Such a strategy will not only keep us from beating ourselves, but it will also lead to victory! God's clock is never slow, but sometimes ours is fast.
