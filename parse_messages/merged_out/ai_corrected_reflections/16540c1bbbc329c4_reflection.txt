Making up false stories is strictly forbidden by the Lord. Gossip, slander, and false witnessing undermine families, strain neighborhood cooperation, and cause chaos in a justice system. Yes, destructive gossip will always cause problems. Even if you do not initiate a lie, you become responsible if you pass it along. The best advice is: don't circulate rumors; squelch them before they get started.
