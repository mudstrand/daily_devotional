Just as we take Jesus' view on the authority of Scripture, the nature of heaven, and the resurrection, we are to have His attitude of love toward other Christians as well. As we grow in faith and come to know Jesus better, we will become more capable of maintaining His attitude of loving unity throughout each day. If you wish to know more about Christ's attitude, read (Phil. 2).
