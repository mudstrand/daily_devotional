It is tempting to judge fellow Christians, evaluating whether or not they are good followers of Christ. But only God knows a person's heart, and He is the only one with the right to judge. Paul's warning to the Corinthians should also warn us. We are to confront those who are sinning (see 1 Corinthians 5:12, 13), but we need to remember we must not judge who is a better servant of Christ. When you judge someone, you are really considering yourself as better, and that is an arrogant assumption.
