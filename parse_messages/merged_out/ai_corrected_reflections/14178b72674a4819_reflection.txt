Do you have the confidence of David? Do you have confidence in God's presence and guidance? From birth to death, we are continually in God's grip. But what is even better, we have hope in the resurrection. Even though our courage and strength may fail, we know that one day we will be raised to a new life to serve Him forever. He is our security and we must cling to Him.
