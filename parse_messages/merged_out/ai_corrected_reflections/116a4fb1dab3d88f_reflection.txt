Paul's natural desire was to visit the church at Rome, but he had delayed his visit because he had heard many good reports about the believers there and knew they were doing well on their own. It was more important for him to preach in areas that had not yet heard the Good News. Do you reach out as you should, or do you restrict your fellowship to other believers?
