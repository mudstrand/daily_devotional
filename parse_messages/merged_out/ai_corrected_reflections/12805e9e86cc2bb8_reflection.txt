Let us never forget. Jesus has power over life and death, as well as power to forgive sins. How is this so? It is because He is the Creator of life (John 14:6). He who is life surely can restore life. Whoever believes in Christ has a spiritual life that death cannot conquer or diminish in any way. When we realize His power and how wonderful His offer to us is, how can we not commit our lives to Him? To us who believe, what a wonderful assurance and certainty we have: "I will live again, and you will too" (John 14:19).
