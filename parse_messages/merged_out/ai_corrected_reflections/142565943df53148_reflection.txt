God offers protection even when the enemies surround us. This is the final scene of this psalm. We see that the believers will dwell with God. God will be the perfect shepherd and the perfect host who promises to guide and protect us throughout our life and to bring us into His house, where a place has already been prepared for us (John 14:2).
