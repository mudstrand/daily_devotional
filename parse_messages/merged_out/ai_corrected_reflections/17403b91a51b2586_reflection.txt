WE MAY respond to discipline in several ways: (1) We can accept it with resignation; (2) we can accept it with self-pity, thinking we really don't deserve it; (3) we can be angry and resentful toward God; or (4) we can accept it gratefully, as the appropriate response we owe a loving Father. God is not only a disciplining parent but also a demanding coach who pushes us to our limits and requires our lives to be disciplined.
