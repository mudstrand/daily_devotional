We have here a wonderful picture of how diligently Jesus searches for lost souls. His great love moves Him on the greatest treasure hunt this world has ever seen. This hunt reached its height on Calvary's wondrous cross. Yes, so precious did Jesus consider each sinner that He was willing to pay the maximum price for each one -- His own blood! Now His love sends Him out every day to search for lost sinners through His Word. How can I ever thank Jesus for the diligent love with which He found me! When I sought Him not.
