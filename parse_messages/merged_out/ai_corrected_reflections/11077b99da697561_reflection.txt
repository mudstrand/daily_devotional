We approach the throne of grace through prayer, not in fear, but "boldly." Some Christians approach God meekly, with heads hung low, afraid to ask God to meet their needs. Others pray flippantly, giving little thought to what they say. Come with reverence because He is your King. But also with bold assurance because He is your Friend and Counselor.
