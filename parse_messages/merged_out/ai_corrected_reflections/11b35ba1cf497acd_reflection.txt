The Holy Spirit gives Christians great power to live for God. But some Christians want more than this. They want to live in a state of perpetual excitement. The tediousness of their everyday lives leads them to conclude that something is wrong spiritually. Often the Holy Spirit's work is teaching us to persist, to keep on doing what is right even when it no longer seems interesting or exciting. If your Christian life seems ordinary, you may need the Holy Spirit to stir you up. Sometimes faith alone seems too easy, but if we allow the Holy Spirit to stir us up, excitement will return to our lives.
