God's ultimate goal for us is to make us like Christ (1 John 3:2). As we become more and more like him, we discover ourselves, the person we were created to be. How can we become like Christ? By reading and heeding the Word—by studying His life on earth through the Gospels, by spending time in prayer, by being filled with the Spirit, and by doing His work in the world. Remember, He promises to guide and protect us until we one day stand in His presence.
