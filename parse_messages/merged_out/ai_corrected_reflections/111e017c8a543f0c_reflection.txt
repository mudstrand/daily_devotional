We may respond to discipline in several ways: (1) We can accept it with resignation. (2) We can accept it with self-pity, thinking we really didn't deserve it. (3) We can be angry and resentful toward God. OR (4) We can accept it gratefully as the appropriate response we owe a loving Father. Best of all, ask the Father what He is trying to teach you!
