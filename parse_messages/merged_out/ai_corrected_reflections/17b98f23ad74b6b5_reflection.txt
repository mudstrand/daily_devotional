Loneliness is everywhere—many people feel cut off and alienated from others. Being in a crowd just makes people more aware of their isolation. We all need friends who will stick close, listen, care, and offer help when it is needed—in good times and bad. A friend is a push when you are stopped, a guide when you are searching, a song when you are glad, a word when you are lonely, a smile when you are sad.
