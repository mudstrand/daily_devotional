God's love is total, says Paul. It reaches every corner of our experience. It is wide - it covers the breadth of our own experience, and it reaches out to the whole world. God's love is long - it continues the length of our life. It is high - it rises to the heights of our celebration and elation. His love is deep - it reaches to the depths of discouragement, despair, and yes, even death. When you feel shut out or isolated, remember you can never be lost to God's love.
