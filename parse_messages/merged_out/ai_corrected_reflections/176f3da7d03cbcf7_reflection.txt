The best medicine is the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It is the good news that the Lamb of God has taken away our sin and has reconciled us to God. This says it all: "Since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ" (Romans 5:1). We can feel it in our bones! Let us give thanks to the Lord Jesus, the great Physician, for bringing joy into our life by taking away our sins.
