Do you always feel like giving thanks? Not me, but we can take heart, because in all things God works for our good if we love Him and are called by Him (Romans 8:28). We need not thank God for our problems, but for the strength He is building in us through the difficult experiences of our life. We can be sure that God's love will see us through.
