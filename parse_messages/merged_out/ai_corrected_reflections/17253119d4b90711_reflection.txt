God stays close to us even in death. When someone we love is nearing death, we may become angry and feel abandoned. But believers (the Lord's loved ones) are precious to God, and He carefully chooses the time when they will be called into His presence. Let this truth provide comfort when you have lost a loved one. Do you struggle with the fear of death? Whenever that fear surfaces, think about how much Jesus longs to bring you home to Himself.
