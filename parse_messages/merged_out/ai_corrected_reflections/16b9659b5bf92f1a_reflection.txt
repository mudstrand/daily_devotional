It is natural to spend time thinking about where we'd like to be or what we'd like to be, but let us remember to always reevaluate our desires to make sure they are consistent with what God says will truly satisfy. When our desires conform to God's will, we're not likely to waste time wishing for things that can't satisfy. Real joy comes not in getting what we want, but in wanting to be close to God.
