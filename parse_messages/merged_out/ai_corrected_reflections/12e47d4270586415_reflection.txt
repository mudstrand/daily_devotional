What we should learn from these three verses is that "love" covers all offenses. Speaking words of hatred only escalates strife, but words of forgiveness, prompted by love, bring righteousness. Even though offenses occur, love will overlook, forgive, and yield to them, not carrying all things to the extremity of justice.
