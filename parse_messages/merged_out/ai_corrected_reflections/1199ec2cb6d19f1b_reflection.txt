The good news is available to everyone, except to those who refuse to believe. Satan is "the god of this evil world." His work is to deceive, and he has blinded those who do not believe in Christ (see 2 Corinthians 11:14, 15). The allure of money, power, and pleasure blinds people to the light of Christ's good news. Those who reject Christ and prefer their own pursuits have unknowingly made Satan their god.
