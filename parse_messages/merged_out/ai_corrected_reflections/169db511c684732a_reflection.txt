Luke tells us that when the two men recognized Jesus, they returned to Jerusalem immediately to tell the rest that it is true, he has risen! Oswald Chambers said, "Jesus rarely comes where we expect him; he appears where we least expect him, and always in the most illogical connections. The only way we can keep true to God is by being ready for the Lord's surprise visits."
