Fear is a dark shadow that envelops us and ultimately imprisons us within ourselves. Each of us has been a prisoner of fear at one time or another—fear of rejection, misunderstanding, uncertainty, sickness, or even death. But we can conquer fear by using the bright, liberating light of the Lord, who brings salvation. If we want to dispel the darkness of fear, let us remember the psalmist that "the Lord is my light and my salvation."
