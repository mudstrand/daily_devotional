It seems contradictory that a law could give us freedom, but God's law points out sin in us and gives us the opportunity to ask for God's forgiveness (read Romans 7:7, 8). As Christians, we are saved by God's grace, and salvation frees us from sin's control. As believers, we are free to live as God created us to live. Of course, this does not mean that we are free to do as we please (read 1 Peter 2:16). We are now free to obey God.
