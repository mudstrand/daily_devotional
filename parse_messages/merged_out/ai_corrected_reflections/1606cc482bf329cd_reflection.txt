Christ must be enthroned; He must have first place. It is God's purpose that He dwell in our hearts personally, permanently, and powerfully (Ephesians 2:22). Christ is not a guest or an occasional visitor; He is the rightful owner and lives here (Galatians 2:20). Faith opens the door and receives Him.
