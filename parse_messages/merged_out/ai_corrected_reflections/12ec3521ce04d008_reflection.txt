How would you begin the day if you were reminded each morning that God has chosen us to be Christ's representative on earth? In light of this truth, Paul challenges us to live lives worthy of the calling we have received. Stop for a moment and think of the awesome privilege we have being called Christ's very own. This includes being humble, gentle, patient, understanding, and peaceful. Remember, if you claim to be a Christian, people are watching your life. Can they see Christ in you? How well are you doing as His representative?
