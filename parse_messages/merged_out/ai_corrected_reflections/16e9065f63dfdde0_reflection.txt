A mother and her two children were destitute. In the depth of winter, they were nearly frozen, and so the mother took the cellar door off its hinges and set it up in front of the corner where they crouched down to sleep so that some of the draft and cold might be kept from them. One of the children whispered to her, "Mother, what do those do who have no cellar door to put up in front of them?" Have you ever thanked God for your many blessings and prayed for those who have less than you?
