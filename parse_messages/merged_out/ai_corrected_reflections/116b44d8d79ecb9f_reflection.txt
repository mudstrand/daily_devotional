As Jerusalem was the center of Jewish life, Rome was the world's political, religious, social, and economic center. There, the major governmental decisions were made, and from there the Good News spread to the ends of the earth. Paul had not yet been to Rome to meet all the Christians there, and, of course, he had not yet met us. We, too, live in a cosmopolitan setting with the entire world open to us. We also have the potential for both widespread influence and wrenching conflict. We need to listen carefully to Paul's teaching about unity, service, and love so we may apply them.
