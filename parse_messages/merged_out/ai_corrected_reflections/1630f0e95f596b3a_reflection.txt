As we saw in 3:1-2, those who live by Wisdom will be blessed with long life. God gives wisdom, and the wise are blessed. Those who reject Wisdom's invitation have no one to blame but themselves for the sad plight of their lives. The wise receive grace's gift, deliverance from the way of death. Those on their way with Folly will get what they deserve and bear it all alone.
