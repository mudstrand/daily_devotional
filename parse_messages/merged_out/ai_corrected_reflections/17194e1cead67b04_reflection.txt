We have become a more transient society due to the job market. Also, studies reveal that many people substitute social media for real-life personal interaction. A person who had been moving around the country as an empty nester said he was made aware of the power of a smile and a friendly greeting to ease loneliness. He said it has also taught me to find comfort in knowing that even when people ignore me, Jesus loves me so much that His eyes never leave me. None of us like to feel invisible.
