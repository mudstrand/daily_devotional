Why should we sing? Is it only to prepare worshipers for the sermon? Paul would have frowned on such an idea because he was convinced that the gospel alone, truthfully proclaimed, is the power of God that brings salvation. (Romans 1:16) No, we sing because it is a great way to express our adoration and proclaim our faith. So let us join enthusiastically with others in praising God through song. The Lord is pleased with any melody of praise that comes from the heart.
