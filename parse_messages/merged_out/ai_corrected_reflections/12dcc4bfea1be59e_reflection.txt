In this day and age, it is hard to believe that occasionally I'm asked, "What does it mean to follow Christ?" As a soldier follows his captain, like that we should follow Christ, our commander. As a slave follows his master, so we should follow Christ, our Lord. As we follow the advice of a trusted counselor, we should follow Jesus' commands to us in Scripture. As we follow the laws of our nation, so we should follow the laws of the Kingdom of Heaven, and you will never walk in darkness.
