If you noticed, David said that there was no treasure more valuable than a personal relationship with God (vs. 2, 5). I hope this has been your experience. Only because of Jesus's own death and resurrection, we too will rise one day (Acts 2:25-28), and we will find in heaven "eternal pleasures" (Psalm 16:11 NKJV).
