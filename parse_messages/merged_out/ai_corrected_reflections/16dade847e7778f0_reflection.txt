Does God use lesser creatures to preserve the lives of people? As a matter of fact, He does so regularly as He provides for our bodily needs through things that grow in nature. God can do it also through special interventions—miracles—as He did for the prophet Elijah. A miracle in a special sense occurred when we came to saving faith in Jesus Christ. Thank the Lord for His many kindnesses to you—especially for the miracle of bringing you to faith in Jesus Christ.
