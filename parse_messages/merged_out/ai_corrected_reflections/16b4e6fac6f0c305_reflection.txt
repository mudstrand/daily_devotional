Changes of the heart can show up on the face. But can changing our expression also help change our heart? Smiling isn't the only thing we can do to change the way we feel. In Psalm 4, we see when distress grips our soul, we can ask the Lord for relief and mercy (v. 1). We can take comfort in knowing we are among those who are favored by Him, remembering He hears us when we call (v. 3). We can acknowledge our feelings and be quiet before Him (v. 4). We can do what is right (v. 5). And trust in Him to give us overflowing gladness (v. 7). And we can rest in the assurance of His peace and safety (v. 8). A heart touched by grace brings joy to the face.
