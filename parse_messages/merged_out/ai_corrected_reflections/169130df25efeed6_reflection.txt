In Psalm 36, we read about God's loving kindness. It describes those who put their trust in Him and are abundantly satisfied. God gives them water from His "river of delights" (v. 8). We can go to God every day for the supply of our needs. Let us be filled with His abundant supply. His fountain will never run dry. God's love is abundant.
