When allowed to run its course, evil often destroys itself. Violent people become victims of violence, and liars become victims of others' deceit. But in the process, innocent people are hurt. Sometimes God intervenes and stops evildoers in their tracks in order to protect His followers. At other times, for reasons known only to Him, God allows evil to continue even though innocent people are hurt. It is during these times that we must ask God to protect us. Remember, God will execute final justice, although it may not be during our lifetime.
