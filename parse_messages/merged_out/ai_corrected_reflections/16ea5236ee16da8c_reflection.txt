Gratitude is what always spoils life when it is left out. A thankful spirit enables one to praise God even when circumstances are difficult. Alexander Whyte, a Scottish preacher, always began his prayers with an expression of gratitude. One cold, miserable day, his people wondered what he would say. He prayed, "We thank Thee, O Lord, that it is not always like this." Yes, we always have something to be thankful for.
