Because of our love for one another, Christians can have an impact that goes far beyond our neighborhoods and communities. Christian love comes from the Holy Spirit (Gal. 5:22). The Bible speaks of it as an action and attitude, not just an emotion. Love is a byproduct of our new life in Christ (Romans 5:5; 1 Corinthians 13). Christians have no excuse for not loving, because Christian love is a decision to act in the best interest of others.
