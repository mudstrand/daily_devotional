It is extremely difficult to remain silent when others tear us down, because we want to protect our reputation. We find it difficult to do nothing while they attack something so precious to us. But we do not have to lash out in revenge or justify our position; we can trust God to protect our reputation. Jesus was silent before His accusers (Luke 23:9, 10). He left His case in God's hands (1 Peter 2:21-24). That is a good place to leave our case too!
