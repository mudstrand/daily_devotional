The Bible describes Christ's love for us as being deeper than the ocean. The beach proclaims His majesty, His presence, and the depth of His love. Let the vastness of the ocean and the beauty of His creation remind you again today that His love for you is fathomless. Remind yourself of the amazing depths of His love that He has for you and praise Him.
