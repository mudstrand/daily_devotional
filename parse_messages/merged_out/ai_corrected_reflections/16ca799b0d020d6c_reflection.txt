God is so responsive that you can always reach Him. He bends down and listens to your voice. This writer's love for the Lord had grown because he had experienced answers to his prayers. If you are discouraged, remember that God is near, listening carefully to every prayer and answering each one in order to give you His best. Worship is a thankful response and not a repayment for what God has done.
