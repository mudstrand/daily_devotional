At times, it seems like God has let sin run rampant in the world, and we wonder if He really notices it. But God sees everything clearly, but the evil actions and the evil intentions lying beneath them (15:11). He is not an indifferent observer. He cares and is active in the world. Right now, His work may be unseen and unfelt, but don't give up. One day, He will wipe out evil and punish the evildoers, just as He will establish the good and reward those who do His will.
