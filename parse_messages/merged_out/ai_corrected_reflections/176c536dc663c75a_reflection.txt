People who live for God often wonder why they still have temptations. Does God still tempt them? God tests people, but He does not tempt them by trying to seduce them to sin. God allows Satan to tempt people, however, in order to refine their faith and to help them grow in their dependence on Christ. We can resist the temptation to sin by turning to God for strength and choosing to obey His Word.
