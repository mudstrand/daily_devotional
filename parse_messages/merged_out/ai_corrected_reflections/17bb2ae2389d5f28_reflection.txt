Here God identifies with the poor, as Jesus does in Matthew 25:31-46. As our Creator, God values all of us, whether we are poor or rich. When we help the poor, we honor both the Creator and His creation. God accepts our help as if we had offered it directly to Him. Jesus says in Luke 6:38, "Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over." As we see in this verse, God returns to you freely, but if we give grudgingly, we may not receive the blessings we were expecting.
