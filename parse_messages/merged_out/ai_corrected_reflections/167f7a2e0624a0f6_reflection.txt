In ancient times, the signet ring was used as a means of identification. Instead of signing their name, people would press their ring into hot wax or soft clay to make their mark. As God's children, we make our mark on the world as we spread the gospel, share His grace through loving our neighbors, and work to end oppression. Each of us has our own unique stamp that reveals how we're created in God's image.
