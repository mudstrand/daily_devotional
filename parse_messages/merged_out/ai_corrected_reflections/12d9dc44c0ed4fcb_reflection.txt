All humans undergo temptation, even those who think that they have special spiritual abilities. God's covenant promise, "He will provide the way of escape." God has promised to remain with His people, and so we are never left in a losing situation. His grace provides new opportunities for us to be faithful. While we live in this flesh and have the devil around us, no one can escape his temptation and lures.
