This verse says, "If you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you." It is not saying, "If you search and find something because of your unbalanced sensitivity," but, "If you remember." In other words, if something is brought to your conscious mind by the Holy Spirit of God, "First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift" (5:24). Never object to the intense sensitivity of the Spirit of God in you when He is instructing you down to the smallest detail.
