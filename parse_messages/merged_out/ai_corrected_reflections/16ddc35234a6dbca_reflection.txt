Jesus, by precept and example, encourages constancy in one's Christian faith and love. In His Sermon on the Mount, He tried to correct religious imbalance, such as this inconsistency: "You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you" (Matthew 5:43-44). Jesus helped us to be consistent by setting this priority: "Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well" (Matthew 6:33).
