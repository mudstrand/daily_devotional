The disciples would often face difficult situations that could only be resolved through prayer. Prayer is the key that unlocks faith in our life. Effective prayer needs both an attitude, complete dependence, and an action, asking. Prayer demonstrates our reliance on God as we humbly invite Him to fill us with faith and power. There is no substitute for prayer, especially in circumstances that seem impossible. In what are you depending upon today? "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." (Philippians 4:13)
