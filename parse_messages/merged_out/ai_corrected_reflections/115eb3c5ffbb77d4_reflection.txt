Paul was an appointed apostle to the Gentiles. Here he reminds his Jewish brothers and sisters of this fact. He was hoping that they too would want to be saved. The Jews had rejected God's offer, and so the Gentiles were offered salvation. But when a Jew comes to Christ, there is great rejoicing, as if a dead person had come back to life.
