This judgment is for those who have rejected God's mercy. For those who accept Christ's love and His salvation, the coming judgment is no cause for worry. Being saved through His grace, they have nothing to fear. There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love. (1 John 4:18)
