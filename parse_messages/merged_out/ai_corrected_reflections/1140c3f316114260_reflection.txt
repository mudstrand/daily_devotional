We are all unworthy and undeserving in God's sight. But blessed be the name of the Lord! The vilest sinners become righteous through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. Think about it, no charge can be made against the justified person. He cannot be convicted of any guilt. He is immune to all accusations. As one who has been acquitted before a court, he is pronounced guiltless. He is reckoned as though he had never committed any sin. He is judged to be as spotless and blameless as Christ Himself.
