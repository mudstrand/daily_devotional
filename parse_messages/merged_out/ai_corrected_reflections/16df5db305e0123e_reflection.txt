It's amazing how a germinated seed multiplies into many of its kind. It can't be looked at in any other way than a miracle, but because it occurs so regularly, we call it a natural process. Now Jesus had to die and be buried before there could be fruits of His redemption. His resurrection gave the assurance of the sufficiency of His sacrifice. Our Savior is still gathering a harvest, with us as His workers!
