The religious rituals of David's day involved sacrificing animals in the tabernacle. But David said these acts were meaningless unless done for the right reasons. Today, we often make rituals of going to church, taking Communion, or paying tithes. These activities are also empty if our reasons for doing them are selfish. God does not want these sacrifices and offerings without an attitude of devotion to Him. Samuel said, "Obedience is far better than sacrifice." (1 Samuel 15:22) Make sure you give God the obedience and lifelong service He desires from you.
