I love a quiet time on a Sunday morning before church service in order to push worldly thoughts from my mind. Today, we live in a noisy world, and even many church services leave little time for quiet reflection. The psalmist's words are truly relevant in our noisy world today, so that we may meet the living God and hear him speak. Let us turn down the world's volume so that we may hear God's voice. Pastor Al.
