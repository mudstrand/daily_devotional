God's kindness and goodness are always directed toward the welfare of mankind. God's goodness is the inexhaustible source from which benefits are forthcoming to us continually. Let us never forget that God is as rich in grace as He is in the marvels and wonders of His creation. Just look at the heavens! Are you able to count the stars? Are you able to measure the waters of the ocean? We have to confess that how great God's universe truly reveals how great He is. Yes, God's kindness is meant to lead us to repentance. Yes, our God desires that we should repent of our sins, feel sorry for having sinned, and be renewed in mind and heart. This is to turn from wrongdoing and seek to be reconciled to God through the grace offered through Jesus Christ.
