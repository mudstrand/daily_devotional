While crossing this body of water, they ran into rough weather to the point of swamping the boat. Why was this happening? Jesus was with them, but He was asleep at the stern of the boat. They learned that day that it is not true that when we do as the Lord says, there will be no storms in our lives. In the storms of our life, we can be confident that all is not lost. Our Pilot can handle the storm. He will get us home.
