Truth is always timely; it applies today and in the future. Because it is connected with God's changeless character, it is also changeless. Think for a moment about the centuries that have passed since these proverbs were written. Consider the countless hours that have been carefully spent studying every sentence of Scripture. The Bible has withstood the test of time. Because God is truth, you can trust His Word to guide you.
