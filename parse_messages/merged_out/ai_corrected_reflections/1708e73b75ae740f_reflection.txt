Jesus is so careful with those He loves. He is constantly guarding us, saving us, and lifting us up. He is our shield and protector. He is our light in the dark. Under His wings, we will find refuge. Know that He is protecting you today. Ask Jesus to put a hedge of protection around you and your loved ones.
