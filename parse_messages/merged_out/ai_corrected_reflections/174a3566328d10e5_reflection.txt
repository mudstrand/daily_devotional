Jesus' words show that the way to eternal life, though unseen, is secure—as secure as your faith in Jesus. He has already prepared the way to eternal life. The only issue that may still be unsettled is your willingness to believe. Yes, we can look forward to eternal life because Jesus has promised it to all who believe in Him. Although the details of eternity are unknown, we need not fear because Jesus is preparing it for us and will spend eternity with us.
