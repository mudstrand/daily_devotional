Have you noticed how easy it is for children to trust and praise God without reservations? Have you also noticed that, as we grow older, many of us find it more and more difficult to do so? So what are we to do? Well, what we need to do is ask God to give us a childlike faith, removing any and all barriers, so that we might have a closer walk with Him. Simple, yes, but oh, how often we neglect to do just that. If we did, it would eliminate oh so many worries.
