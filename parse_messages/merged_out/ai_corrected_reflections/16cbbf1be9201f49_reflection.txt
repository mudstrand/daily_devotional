This psalm expresses assurance and hope in God's protection day and night. He not only made the hills, but heaven and earth as well. We should never trust a lesser power than God Himself. But not only is He all-powerful, He also watches over us. Nothing diverts or deters Him, we are safe. We never outgrow our need for God's unfailing watch over us.
