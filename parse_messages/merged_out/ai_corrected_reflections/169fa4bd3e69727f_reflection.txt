On the basis of this verse, we give departed believers only a temporary farewell. The transition that we see suggests that we are only changing from one situation to another. Though life on earth ends for us, we will continue to live forever and better in the next life where Jesus is. So let us encourage one another with these words: "Because of Jesus, we have hope and are sure of a forever life."
