If we are ever afraid of the future, eternity, or God's judgment, we need to remind ourselves of God's love. We know that God loves us perfectly (Romans 8:38-39). We can resolve our fears first by focusing on His immeasurable love for us, and then by allowing Him to love others through us. His love will quiet your fears and give you confidence.
