Paul launches into a discussion about what our resurrection bodies will be like. If you could select your own bodies, what kind would you choose? What would you choose? Would it be strong, athletic, or beautiful? Paul explains that we will be recognizable in our resurrected body, yet it will be better than we can imagine, because it will be made to last forever. We will still have our own personality and individuality, but they will be perfect through Christ's work.
