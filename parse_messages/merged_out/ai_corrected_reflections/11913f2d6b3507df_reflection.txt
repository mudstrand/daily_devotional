Christian who are still alive when Christ returns will not have to die, but will be transformed immediately. A trumpet blast will usher in the new heaven and the new earth. The Jews would understand the significance of this because trumpets were always blown to signal the start of great festivals and other extraordinary events. What will you be doing when the last Trumpet blows? Will you be ready when the Lord returns?
