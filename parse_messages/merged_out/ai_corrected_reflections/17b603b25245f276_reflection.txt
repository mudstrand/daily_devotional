It takes intense heat to purify gold and silver, similarly, it often takes the heat of trials for the Christian to be purified through trials. God shows us what is in us and clears out anything that gets in the way of complete trust in Him. Peter says, "These trials are only to test your faith, to show that it is strong and pure. It is being tested as fire tests and purifies gold-and your faith is far more precious to God than mere gold" (1 Peter 1:7). So when tough times come your way, realize that God wants to use them to refine your faith and purify your heart.
