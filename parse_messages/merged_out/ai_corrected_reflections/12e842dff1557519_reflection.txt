The Lord encourages Joshua with assurances of success and promises of His presence through His empowering Word, as Joshua begins the critical work of conquering and allotting the Promised Land to Israel. If we were left alone in our sin and weakness, we would not be able to serve God and become successful in His eyes. Yet, God enables us through the promises of His Scriptures. He makes us strong and courageous for service by assuring us that through Immanuel ("God with us") we are forgiven and will inherit not a piece of land, such as Israel, but a better, eternal home.
