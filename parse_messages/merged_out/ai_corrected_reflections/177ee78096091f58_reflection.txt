"Since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ" (Romans 5:1). We can in no way say that we are justified (fully or in part) by good works. That would be works-righteousness, which has no place in Christian beliefs. How thankful we can be that salvation, forgiveness, and peace with God do not rest on what we are able to do but are entirely the work of Christ.
