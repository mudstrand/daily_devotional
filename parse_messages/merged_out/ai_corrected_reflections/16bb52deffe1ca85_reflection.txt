Are you facing a difficulty—the loss of a loved one—a severe physical or emotional crisis? Turn it over to God. You'll have many trying days, but He'll give you the strength to go on and His peace to comfort your soul. Claim the double promise of (Psalm 29:11) as your own. The secret of peace is to give all your anxieties to God.
