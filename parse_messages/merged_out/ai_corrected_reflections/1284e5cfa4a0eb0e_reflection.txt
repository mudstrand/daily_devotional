Jesus is talking about a new relationship between believers and God. Previously, people had to approach God through priests. After Jesus' resurrection, any believer could approach God directly. Yes, a new day has dawned, and now all believers are priests, talking with God personally and directly (Hebrews 10:19-23). Yes, we can approach God, not because of our own merits, but because Jesus, our great High Priest, has made us acceptable to God.
