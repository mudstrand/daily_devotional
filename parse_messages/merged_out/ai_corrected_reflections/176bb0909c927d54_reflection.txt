Our joy, prayers, and thankfulness should not fluctuate with our circumstances or feelings. Obeying these three commands, be joyful, keep praying, and be thankful - often goes against our natural inclinations. When we make a conscious decision to do what God says, however, we will begin to see people in a new perspective. When we do God's will, we find it easier to be joyful and thankful.
