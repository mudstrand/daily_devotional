I believe we all often wish we could escape troubles—the pain of grief, loss, sorrow, and failure, or even small daily frustrations that constantly wear us down. God promises to be "close to the brokenhearted" and to be our source of power, courage, and wisdom, helping us through problems. Sometimes He chooses to deliver us from those problems. When trouble strikes, don't get frustrated with God. Instead, admit that you need His help and thank Him for being by your side.
