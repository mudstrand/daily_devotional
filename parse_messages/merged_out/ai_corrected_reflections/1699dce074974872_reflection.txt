Scriptures say that believers are children of the light. This means that we need to live in the full light of God's presence to thrive (Psalm 89:15). If we try to live in darkness, we will produce nothing but "fruitless deeds" (see Ephesians 5:3-4). But if we are living in the light of Jesus, who is the Light of the world, we will produce the fruit of His light, which is good, faithful, and true.
