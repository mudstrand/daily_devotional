The Jews held a favored position as God's chosen people. They had been given the divine law, and knowledge of the true God had been revealed to them. Because of this, they were inclined to judge others who did not possess the knowledge they did. Paul warns against this human tendency to judge; it is an inclination that is often used as an attempt to defend oneself and to build personal security. But we need to remember that we are all guilty before God.
