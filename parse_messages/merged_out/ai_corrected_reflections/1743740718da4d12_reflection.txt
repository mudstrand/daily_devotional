If you ever feel that there is never enough time, ask yourself if you had one extra hour today, what would you have spent it doing? Tomorrow, make that the first thing that you get done. When you realize that you can shift priorities and manage time, you can begin to have more control over how you spend your day. Lord, help me to make the changes I need to make so that I feel better at the end of the day.
