WHO knew that Jesus's death on a Roman cross would turn out to reveal an eternal glory. WHO would have imagined that in the public curse and the agony of the cross we would find eternal glory. WHO could have foreseen that all of heaven and earth would one day sing, "Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise!" Let us not forget that the Lamb who died is the Lord who lives.
