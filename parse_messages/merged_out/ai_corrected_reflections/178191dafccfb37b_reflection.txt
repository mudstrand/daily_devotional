What we have here is a paradox, a yes-and-no situation. Yes, many in Jerusalem recognized Jesus, but they really didn't know Him. To some, He was an imposter, a troublemaker, or a mere teacher and would-be healer. To a relative few, He was the Messiah and Son of God revealed. For a relative few, John wrote, "He was in the world, and though the world was made through Him, the world did not recognize Him" (John 1:10). He remained a stranger and a traveler just passing through.
