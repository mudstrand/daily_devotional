Troubles may follow us all the days of our lives, but we need not lose heart. For our troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So let us not fix our eyes on what is seen, but on what is not seen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal. Heaven's delights will far outweigh earth's difficulties.
