I do not know how many times I have been asked, "How do we get eternal life?" Here, Jesus tells us clearly—by knowing God the Father Himself through His Son, Jesus Christ. Eternal life requires entering into a personal relationship with God in Jesus Christ. When we admit our sin and turn away from it, Christ's love lives in us by the Holy Spirit.
