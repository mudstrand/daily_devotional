In the first verse of Psalm 15, David asked what kind of person could live in God's holy presence. In the second verse, he answers his own question: it is one whose walk is blameless, a person of integrity. Have you examined your integrity? Does your integrity stand the test of living honestly day by day? David said that if we do, we will never be shaken (15:5).
