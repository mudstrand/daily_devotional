Just as the sun burns away the fog, our faith in God can burn away the haze of doubt. Remember that when we believe that God will fulfill His promises even though we don't see those promises materialize yet, that is when we demonstrate true faith. So let us walk in faith, with God as our guide. He will deliver!
