We see here that David promises to praise God among the people because his private deliverance deserved a public testimony. At times, we may go through trials not because we want to suffer, but because we want to obey God's will. Let the example of Jesus' obedience sustain and encourage you in times of trial. You will be able to face anything if you know that Jesus is with you. Let us always be prepared to offer public praise for His care for us.
