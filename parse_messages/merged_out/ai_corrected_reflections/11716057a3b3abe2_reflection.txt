When you really think about it, God's work involves many different individuals with a variety of gifts and abilities. There are no superstars in this task. There are only team members performing their own special roles. There is no reason we cannot become useful members of God's team. All we need to do is set aside our desire to receive glory for what we do. Don't seek the praise that comes from people; it is comparatively worthless. Instead, seek approval from God.
