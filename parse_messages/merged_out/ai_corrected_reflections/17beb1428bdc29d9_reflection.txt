This proverb is about saving for the future. Easy credit has people living on the edge of bankruptcy. The desire to keep up appearances and to accumulate more drives them to spend every penny they earn, and they stretch their credit to the limit. But anyone who spends all he has is spending more than he can afford. A wise person puts money aside for hard times. God approves of foresight and restraint. God's people need to examine their lifestyle to see whether their spending is God-pleasing or merely self-pleasing.
