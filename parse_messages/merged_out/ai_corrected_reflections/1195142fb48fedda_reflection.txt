Paul knew the importance of honesty and sincerity in word and actions, especially in a situation as in Corinth, where constructive criticism was necessary. So Paul did not approach with impressive human knowledge (earthly wisdom). God wants us to be real and transparent in all our relationships. If we aren't, we may end up lowering ourselves to spreading rumors, gossiping, and second-guessing.
