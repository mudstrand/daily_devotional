The Good Friday event, the death of Christ, is viewed in Holy Writ from two points of view. It presents Christ in the dual role of the sacrificing priest and of the offering that He brought. The Hebrews epistle emphasizes Christ as our High Priest. Other Scripture adds to that by speaking of Christ as the sacrificial Lamb. John the Baptist called Jesus the Lamb of God, and St. Paul, writing to the Corinthians, declared, "Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed [for us]" (1 Corinthians 5:7).
