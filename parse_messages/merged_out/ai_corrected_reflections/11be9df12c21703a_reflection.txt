We need to keep in mind that God is interested in every part of our life, not just the spiritual part. As we live by the Holy Spirit's power, we need to submit every aspect of our life to God: emotional, physical, social, intellectual, vocational. Paul says that because we're saved, we should live like it! The Holy Spirit is the source of our new life, so we should keep in step with his leading. Don't let anything or anyone else determine your values and standards in any area of your life.
