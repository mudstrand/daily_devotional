Zacchaeus, the tax collector in Jericho, was small, but that did not keep him from seeing Jesus or Jesus from seeing him. Life's circumstances—height, age, income—are of no significance to Jesus. Because of original sin, we are all on the same level in the sight of God. In Christ, the Mediator, He has compassion on us all. Our Lord is concerned about little people. He accepts and blesses the little children we bring to Him in Holy Baptism. The Lord has a heart for all.
