To imagine their wealth is their strongest defense, rich people are sadly mistaken. Money cannot provide safety—there are too many ways for it to lose its power. The government may cease to back it—thieves may steal it—inflation may rob it of all value. But God never loses His power. He is always dependable. Where do you look for security and safety—in uncertain wealth or God who is always faithful?
