Not only does the Bible contribute to our belief in the best is yet to be, but the things of our daily lives reveal that this is true, too. The phrase "the best is yet to be" is a positive affirmation that gives life direction. It provides hope: there is more to come in life. It's the spirit of expectancy; good things are going to happen. It is seen through the eyes that look for opportunities that will be greater than ever. It is received through proper planning and work. Desire is the fuel that makes it a reality. The best is yet to be!
