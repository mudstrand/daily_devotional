Why should we sing? Is it only to prepare worshipers for the sermon? Let us never say this is a gimmick! The writer of Psalm 33 called upon the worshiping Israelites to sing praises to God for His powerful Word, His unfailing counsel, and His continual concern for His people. Remember the Lord is pleased with any melody of praise that comes from the heart.
