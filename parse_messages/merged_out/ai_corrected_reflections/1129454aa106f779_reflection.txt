These words tell of impending judgment awaiting those who do not possess the righteousness that God provided through His Son, Jesus Christ. The need for the Gospel is made clear because we are informed of the need that is ours. Unless we have Christ, we have the wrath of God hovering over us. This warning is made very clear in v. 5 of chapter 2: "By your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed."
