Paul compares the body of Christ with a human body. Each part has a specific function that is necessary to the body as a whole. The parts are different for a purpose, and in their difference they must work together. Christians have to avoid two common errors: (1) Being proud of their abilities, or (2) Thinking they have nothing to give to the body of believers. Instead of comparing ourselves to one another, we should use our different gifts, together, to spread the Good News of salvation.
