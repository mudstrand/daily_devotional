Jesus sat down to set the twelve straight: "If anyone wants to be first, he must be the very last." Jesus didn't stop with words. He gave the group an object lesson in humility. He placed in their midst a child who personified the kind of faith and love that should mark every disciple, young or old. The person who has a childlike-not childish-faith is a true representative of Christ.
