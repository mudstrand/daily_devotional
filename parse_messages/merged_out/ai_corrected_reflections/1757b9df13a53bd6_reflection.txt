"To believe" is more than an intellectual agreement that Jesus is God. It means to put our trust and confidence in Him, that He alone can save us. It is to put Christ in charge of our plans and eternal destiny. Believing is both trusting His words as reliable and relying on Him for the power to change. If you have never trusted Christ, let His promise of everlasting life be yours and believe.
