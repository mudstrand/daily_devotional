The people of Israel were foolish to act as if they knew what God was thinking and planning. His knowledge and wisdom are far greater than any human's. We are foolish also to think we can fit God into our mold—to make His plans and purposes conform to ours. Instead, we must strive to fit into His plans. The Lord always extends an invitation to us for His salvation.
