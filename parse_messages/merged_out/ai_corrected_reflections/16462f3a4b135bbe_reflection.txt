Righteousness exalts a nation. Here, we have a reminder aimed especially at rulers and other public servants that their good example is beneficial to the entire nation. Their sin, likewise, affects and disgraces all who live under their rule. My main thought here is, I wonder if other nations think that all citizens in this country cannot be trusted because of the behavior of the leaders of this country?
