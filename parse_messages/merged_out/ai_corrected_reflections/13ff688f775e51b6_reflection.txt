"Consider yourself dead to sin" means that we should regard our sinful nature as dead and unresponsive to sin. Because of our union and identification with Christ, we no longer want to pursue our old plans, desires, and goals. Now we want to live for the glory of God. As we start our "new" life in Christ, the Holy Spirit will help us to become all that Christ wants us to be.
