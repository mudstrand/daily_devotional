In vs. 1-6, David described all that he had as gifts from God: his heart's desire, success and prosperity, a crown of fine gold, long life, splendor and majesty, eternal blessing, and joy. We, too, must look upon all that we have—position, family, wealth, talent—as a gift from God. Only then will we use them to give glory back to Him.
