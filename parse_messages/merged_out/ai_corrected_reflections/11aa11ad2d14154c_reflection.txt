Paul continued his "boasting" by telling about visions and revelations he had received from the Lord. Paul explained that he didn't know if he was taken up in his body or in his spirit. This incident cannot be positively identified with a recorded event in Paul's career, although some think this may have been when he was stoned and left for dead (Acts 14:19, 20). Our Lesson for Today: The reason Paul told about this incident was to show that he had been uniquely touched by God. Suppose you had had such an experience, could you explain it any better than Paul?
