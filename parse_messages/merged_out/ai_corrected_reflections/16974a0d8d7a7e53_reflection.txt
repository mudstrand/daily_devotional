In Exodus 18, we see that Moses was wearing himself out serving alone as judge over the Israelites. His father-in-law warned Moses that his workload was too heavy and suggested that he delegate some of the work to others. Now, in Mark 6:30-31, Jesus often slipped away to rest and pray. When we follow His example, we will be more effective in our relationships and better able to give care to others. Don't try to do everything; take time to refresh your body and spirit.
