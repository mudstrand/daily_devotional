NOW THIS VERSE DOES NOT MEAN THAT GOD CREATED SOME PEOPLE TO BE WICKED, BUT RATHER THAT GOD USES EVEN THE ACTIVITIES OF WICKED PEOPLE FOR HIS PURPOSE (READ GENESIS 50:20). GOD IS INFINITE, AND WE ARE FINITE. NO MATTER HOW GREAT OUR INTELLECTS, WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HIM COMPLETELY. BUT WE CAN ACCEPT BY FAITH THAT HE IS ALL-POWERFUL, ALL-LOVING, AND PERFECTLY GOOD. WE CAN BELIEVE THAT HE IS NOT THE CAUSE OF EVIL (JAMES 1:13-17), AND WE CAN TRUST THERE ARE NO LOOSE ENDS IN HIS SYSTEM OF JUDGMENT. EVIL IS A TEMPORARY CONDITION IN THE UNIVERSE. ONE DAY GOD WILL DESTROY IT.
