These people of faith died without receiving all that God had promised, but they never lost their vision of heaven ("A better place, a heavenly homeland"). Many Christians have become frustrated and defeated because their needs and wants, expectations and demands are not immediately met when they accept Christ as Savior. They become impatient and want to quit. Are you discouraged because the achievement of your goals seems far away? Take courage from these heroes of faith, who lived and died without seeing the fruit of their faith on earth and yet continued to believe. (For further insight, look at Hebrews 11:36-39.)
