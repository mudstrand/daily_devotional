David was forced to flee for safety several times. Even being God's anointed king did not make him immune to injustice and hatred from others. David fled, but not as if all was lost. He knew that God was in control. While David wisely avoided trouble, he did not fearfully run away from his troubles. David was comforted and optimistic because he knew God was greater than anything his enemies could bring against him. Let us not forget that faith in God keeps us from losing hope and helps us resist fear.
