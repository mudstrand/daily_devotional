The disciples panicked because the storm threatened to destroy them all, and Jesus seemed unaware and unconcerned. Theirs was a physical storm, but storms also come in other forms. Think about the storms in your life—the situations that cause you great anxiety. Whatever your difficulty, you have two options; you can worry and assume that Jesus no longer cares, or you can resist fear, putting your trust in Him. When you feel like panicking, confess your need for God and then trust Him to care for you.
