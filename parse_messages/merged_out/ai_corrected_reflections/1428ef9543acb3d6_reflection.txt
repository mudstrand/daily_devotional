When David said he had walked in integrity, he was not claiming to be sinless—that is impossible for any human being. But he was consistently in fellowship with God, clearing his record when he sinned by asking for forgiveness. Here he pleads with God to clear his name of false charges made against him by his enemies. We too can ask God to examine us, trusting Him to forgive our sins and clear our record according to His mercy.
