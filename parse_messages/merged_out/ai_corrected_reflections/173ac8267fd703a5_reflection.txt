THE ANCHOR is an ancient Christian symbol of hope, security, and steadfastness. When the future feels uncertain, and you are disoriented or confused, turn to this verse. Jesus is your security. He is an anchor for your soul. Today's Prayer: God, You are the Rock of my Salvation, sustain and support me through fearful times.
