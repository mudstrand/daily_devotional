Knowing that Christ suffered pain and faced temptation should help us to face our trials. Jesus understands our struggles because He faced them as a human being. We can trust Christ to help us survive suffering and overcome temptation. So when you face trials, go to Jesus for strength and patience. He understands your needs and is able to help. (see Hebrews 4:14-16).
