Our natural bodies are perishable and prone to decay. But our resurrection bodies will be transformed. Our spiritual bodies will not be limited by the laws of nature. This does not necessarily mean we will be super-people, but our body will be different from and more capable than our present earthly body. Our spiritual body will not be weak, we will never get sick, and we will never die.
