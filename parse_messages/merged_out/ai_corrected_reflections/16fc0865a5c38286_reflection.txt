There's nothing wrong with dreaming and having goals. The problem lies in thinking possessions or excitement will fulfill our needs. I still dream, but now my eyes are open. My "dream come true" is Jesus. What more could I want? Create a new type of bucket list. Develop a taste for a lasting treasure.
