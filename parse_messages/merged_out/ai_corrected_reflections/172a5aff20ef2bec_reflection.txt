We cannot be saved without faith in Christ, but our faith lacks sincerity if it does not reach out to others. Fasting can be beneficial spiritually and physically, but at its best fasting helps only the person during it. God says He wants our fasting to go beyond our own personal growth to acts of kindness, charity, justice, and generosity. This truly is pleasing to God.
