Wouldn't it be great if we could feel enthusiastic every day? I think we've all had days that we did not feel like rejoicing. Our mood was down, our situation was out of hand, and our sorrow or guilt was overwhelming. When you don't feel like rejoicing, tell God how you truly feel. You will find that God will give you something to rejoice about. God has given you this day to live and serve Him—be glad!
