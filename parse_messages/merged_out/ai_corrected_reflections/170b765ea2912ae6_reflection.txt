Jesus's faithful, unchanging nature is a rock-solid truth we can count on. When Jesus invites us by saying, "Follow me," He is also saying, "You can count on Me. The road may be treacherous, but I'll keep you safe. I'll light the way for you, and you can rely on my strength. I don't mind carrying you. And I don't get distracted or consumed by other issues, or relax my grip on you." Remember, Jesus has promised to never leave you or forsake you. What are your vows to Him?
