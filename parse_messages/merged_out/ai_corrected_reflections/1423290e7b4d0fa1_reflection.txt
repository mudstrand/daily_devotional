When others despise us and belittle us, they treat us as if we were less than human. After being degraded, we may become like David, and feel like worms and possibly feel like maybe they are right—maybe I am no good. When we feel the sting of rejection, we need to keep in mind the hope and victory that God promises us. Yes, He has said, "I will never leave you or forsake you." That to us should be enough.
