The hurting children of the world need two things: First, the gospel of Jesus, who told us that in helping them we would be doing His work (Mark 9:37). And second, they need the hope that comes from someone who cares enough to feed, clothe, and shelter them. What can your family do to help the children? Give hope to a child, share the love of Christ.
