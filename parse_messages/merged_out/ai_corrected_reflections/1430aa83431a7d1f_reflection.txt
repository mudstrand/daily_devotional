How many times have you gotten a guarantee that was not worth the paper it was written on? Well, we need not worry about God's promises because all of God's words are true and trustworthy. The Bible is reliable because, unlike people, God does not lie, forget, change His words, or leave His promises unfulfilled. We can trust the Bible because it contains the words of a holy, trustworthy, and unchanging God.
