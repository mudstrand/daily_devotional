Four people were changed in the process of Jesus' death: the criminal, dying on the cross beside Jesus, asked Jesus to include him in His kingdom (Luke 23:39-43). The Roman officer proclaimed that Jesus was surely the Son of God (Mark 15:39). Joseph and Nicodemus, members of the Jewish high council and secret followers of Jesus (John 7:50-52), came out of hiding. These men were changed more by Jesus' death than by His life. They realized who Jesus was, and that realization brought out their belief, proclamation, and action. When confronted with Jesus' death, we too should be changed to believe, to proclaim, and to act.
