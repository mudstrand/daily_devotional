Eating "anything" may refer to a strong Christian being free from dietary restrictions, or it may refer to his eating meat offered to idols. The person weaker in the faith, however, may eat only vegetables and refuse to eat meat that has been offered to idols. But how would Christians end up eating meat that had been offered to idols? The ancient system of sacrifice was at the center of the religious, social, and domestic life of the Roman world. After a sacrifice was presented to a god in a pagan temple, only part of it was burned. The remainder was often sent to the market to be sold. Thus, a Christian might easily ~ even unknowingly ~ buy such meat in the marketplace or eat it at the home of a friend. Should a friend question the source of the meat? Some thought there was nothing wrong with eating meat that had been offered to idols because idols were worthless. Others carefully checked the source of their meat or gave up meat altogether, in order to avoid a guilty conscience. What does this have to do with us today? Well, whether your conscience bothers you because of something you eat or possibly because of certain conduct, you should seek a clearer understanding of what you are doing ~ it just could be the Holy Spirit speaking to you. He may want you to pray for direction.
