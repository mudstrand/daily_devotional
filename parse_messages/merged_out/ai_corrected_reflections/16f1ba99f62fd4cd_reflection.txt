Today's Hope for Us All: Let us remember, it is not the swaddling clothes of ceremonialism, but the Christ of the simple Gospel story constantly lived, that shall make Christmas perpetual in the heart of man. So, let's make this Christmas different; let us find a variety of ways of showing to others that God is indeed Immanuel, God with us.
