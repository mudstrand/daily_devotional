The important truths are that the people who failed to enter Canaan were the people who had heard God's promise. They did not believe in God's protection. They did not believe that God would help them conquer the giants in the land. So God sent them into the wilderness to wander for 40 years. This was an unhappy alternative to the wonderful gift he had planned for them. Be ever mindful of the fact that the lack of trust in God always prevents us from receiving His best.
