Prayer is not a way of making use of God; prayer is a way of offering ourselves to God in order that He should be able to make use of us. It may be that one of our great faults in prayer is that we talk too much and listen too little. When prayer is at its highest, we should wait in silence for God's voice to us. We might call this a "listening prayer," and it is a practice we need to develop. God speaks through His Word—take time to listen.
