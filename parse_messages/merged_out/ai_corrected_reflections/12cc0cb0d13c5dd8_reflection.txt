In the Old Testament, "know" means more than knowledge. It implies an intimate relationship. The communion between God the Father and God the Son is the core of their relationship. For anyone else to know God, God must reveal Himself to that person, by the Son's choice. How fortunate we are that Jesus clearly revealed God to us, as well as His truth and how we can know Him.
