All the attributes of Christ, as God and man, are at our disposal. All the fullness of the Godhead, whatever that wonderful term may bring to mind, is ours to make us complete. He cannot endow us with the attributes of Deity, but He has done all that can be done, for He has made even His divine power and Godhead subservient to our salvation. He did it all—He Himself said it when He said on the cross, "It is finished."
