Jeremiah knew from experience about God's faithfulness. God had promised that punishment would follow disobedience, and it did. But God had also promised future restoration and blessing, and Jeremiah knew that God would keep that promise also. Trusting in God's faithfulness day by day makes us confident in His great promises for the future.
