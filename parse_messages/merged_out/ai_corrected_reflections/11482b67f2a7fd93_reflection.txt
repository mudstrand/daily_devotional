Here is the corrected text:

Here are some real thoughts: The love that caused Christ to die is the same love that sends His Holy Spirit to live in us and guide us every day. AND the same power that raised Christ from the dead is the same power that saved us and is available to us in our daily life. ALSO, be assured of this: having begun a life with Christ, you have a reserve of power and love to call on each day for help to meet every challenge or trial. All you need to do is pray for God's power and love as you need it.
