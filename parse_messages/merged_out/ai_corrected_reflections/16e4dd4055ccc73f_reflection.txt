If we are totally honest, I believe we would all have to say we struggle to come into God's presence with the excitement and humility that is spoken of in Psalm 95. But thankfully, the psalmist directs us to not self-generate emotions but to remember the God we worship. He is our Creator, who has formed and protected us by His strong hands. And much more—He is our Good Shepherd, who has made us the sheep of His loving hands. Dear Lord, lead us into Your presence with thanksgiving and joy.
