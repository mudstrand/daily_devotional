I wonder what God thinks about the way we sing in church. I'm not talking about the quality of our voices, but the honesty of our words. "Just as I am," "Just as I pretend to be." "O How I Love Jesus" becomes "O How I like Jesus." "I Surrender All" is actually "I Surrender Some." "He's Everything to Me" means "He's Quite a Bit to Me." To sing God's praises, let us keep our hearts in tune with Him.
