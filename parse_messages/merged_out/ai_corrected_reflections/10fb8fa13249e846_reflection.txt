I think we would all agree that here again we see the mystery of God's love revealed. The book of Hebrews links God's saving power with His creative power. In other words, the power that brought the universe into being and that keeps it operating is the very power that cleanses our sins. How mistaken we would be to ever think that God couldn't forgive us. No sin is too big for the Ruler of the universe to handle. He can and will forgive us when we come to Him through His Son. Through His Love we witness grace upon grace. May you truly experience the Mystery of His love for you.
