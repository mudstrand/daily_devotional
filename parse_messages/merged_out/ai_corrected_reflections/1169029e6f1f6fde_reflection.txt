If we seek a sensitivity to the Lord's will, true knowledge of the Scriptures will affect our attitude toward the present and the future. The more we know about what God has done in years past, the greater the confidence we will have about what He will do in the days ahead. We need to diligently read our Bible so we have the confidence that God's will is best for us.
