Jesus, like us, was tempted, but when He was tempted in the desert by the devil, He fought back by speaking the word itself. We can be comforted, knowing that Jesus faced temptations, so He can sympathize with us. We can draw encouragement from the fact that He did not fall into sin. By His life, He shows us that we, too, don't have to sin when facing the seductive lure of temptation. Remember, Jesus is the only perfect human being who has ever lived. Ask Jesus to direct you to Scriptures when you are tempted. Then prepare for the victory.
