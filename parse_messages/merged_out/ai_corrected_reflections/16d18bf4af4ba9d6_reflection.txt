Sometimes we feel as if we don't understand ourselves—what we want, how we feel, what's wrong with us, or what we should do about it. But God's understanding has no limit, and therefore He understands us fully. If you feel troubled and don't understand yourself, remember that God understands you perfectly. So take your mind off yourself and focus on God.
