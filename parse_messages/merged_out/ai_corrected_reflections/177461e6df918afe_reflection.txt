How can we be sure of the permanence of Christ's peace? The prophet continued with this proof: "For to us a Child is born, to us a Son is given." (Isaiah 9:6). This Child made a perfect and permanent peace with God through the reconciliation He effected as the Lamb of God sacrificed for our sins. Now the church's spokesmen can comfort God's people by proclaiming to them that their warfare is accomplished, their iniquity is pardoned. As God in Christ forgives us, so we are to forgive others. We do more than bury the hatchet with the handle sticking out. We forgive really and truly—from the heart. We are to live in peace with all people.
