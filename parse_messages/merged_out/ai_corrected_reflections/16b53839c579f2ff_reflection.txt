Charles Spurgeon once wrote many years ago, "If you are not seeking the Lord, the devil is seeking you." So we need to seek the Lord early and rely on His help, being aware of the fact that the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour (1 Peter 5:8). David came to God early in the morning and asked Him for His protection and help. This was David's regular practice. Let's not move into any day without being aware of our urgent need for the Lord.
