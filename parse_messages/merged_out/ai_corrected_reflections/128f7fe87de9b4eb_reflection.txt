If I had but one name to remember, whose would it be? Paul reminds me clearly, he says, "Jesus." In fact, he says that Jesus' name is above every name. And because of what Jesus has done, every knee should bow. What has He done? Because of His work, I can be God's child and live with Him forever. Yes, His name is above every name. He's my only Savior.
