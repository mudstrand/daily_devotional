The picture of the law as being a guardian is similar to a teacher giving a young child supervision. The law teaches us the need for salvation. God's grace gives us that salvation. The Old Testament still applies today. In it, God reveals His nature, His will for humanity, His moral laws, and His guidelines for living. But we cannot be saved by keeping the law; we must trust in Christ.
