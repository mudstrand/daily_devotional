A spiritual slump can make us feel abandoned by God. We may struggle with troubling thoughts. Our hearts may become sorrowful like David, and become sure we are fighting a losing battle. While in a slump, we need to plead with God, trust Him, and praise Him as David did. To tackle life's problems, let's remember to trust God's promises.
