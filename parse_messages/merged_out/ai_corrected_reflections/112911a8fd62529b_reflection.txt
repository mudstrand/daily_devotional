What is being said is: the righteousness of God is made known through the Gospel. What a revelation this is! It is this, that Christ's merit is imputed to believers. It is a right given to believers, and it is the only righteousness that will stand valid before God. This plan was conceived in the mind of God in order to provide a way of righteousness for persons who would claim it, through members of a fallen race. This way of righteousness has been wrought for us through Jesus Christ. It is appropriated by faith, and by it a sinner is acquitted from all guilt. When a person accepts this righteousness offered by the Lord, his name is entered into the book of life and he becomes an heir to eternal life.
