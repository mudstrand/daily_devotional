Whether we buy or sell, make a product or offer a service, we know what is fair and honest and what is unfair and dishonest. Sometimes we feel pressure to be dishonest to advance ourselves or gain more profit. But we want to obey God; there is no middle ground. God demands honesty in every business transaction. No amount of rationalizing can justify a dishonest business practice. Honesty and fairness are not always easy, but they are what God demands. Ask Him for discernment and courage to be consistently honest and fair.
