Have you ever heard someone say, "I can't think of anything God has done for me, how can I praise Him?" This psalm gives two reasons for praising God: first, His unfailing love toward us, second, His faithfulness endures forever. If He did nothing else for us, He would still be worthy of our highest praise. God's salvation is available for all people who believe in Him, not just the Jews.
