Isolation is the agony Christ suffered when His eternal relationship with the Father was broken on the cross. We hear this in His cry captured in (Matthew 27:46). About three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" (which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"). As He suffered and died under the burden of our sins, Christ was suddenly alone. Those who know Jesus are never alone.
