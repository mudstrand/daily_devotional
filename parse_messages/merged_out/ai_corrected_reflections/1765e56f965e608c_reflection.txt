By telling us not to retaliate, Jesus keeps us from taking the law into our own hands. By loving and praying for our enemies, we can overcome evil with good. If we love our enemies and treat them well, we will truly show that Jesus is Lord of our life. This is possible only for those who give themselves fully to God, because only He can deliver us from natural selfishness. We must trust the Holy Spirit to help us show love to those for whom we may not feel love.
