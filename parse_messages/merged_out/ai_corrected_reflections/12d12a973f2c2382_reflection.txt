What a birth announcement! The shepherds were terrified, but their fear turned to joy as the angels announced the Messiah's birth. First the shepherds ran to see the baby; then they ran to spread the Word. Jesus is your Messiah, your Savior. Do you look forward to meeting Him in prayer and His Word each day? Have you discovered a Lord so wonderful that you can't help sharing your joy with your friends? Be sure to read the Christmas story again this year. It never gets old. Luke 2:1-20
