Although Abram had been demonstrating his faith through his actions, it was his belief in the Lord, not his actions, that made Abram right with God (Romans 4:1-5). Yes, we too can have a right relationship with God by trusting Him. Our outward actions, church attendance, prayer, good deeds will not by themselves make us right with God. A right relationship is based on faith—the heartfelt inner confidence that God is who He says He is and does what He says He will do. Right actions will follow naturally as byproducts.
