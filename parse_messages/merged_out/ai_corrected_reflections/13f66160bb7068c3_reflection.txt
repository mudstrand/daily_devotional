Christians are brand new people on the inside. The Holy Spirit gives them new life, and they are not the same anymore. We are not reformed, rehabilitated, or reeducated; we are recreated (new creations) living in vital union with Christ (Colossians 2:6, 7). At conversion, we do not merely turn over a new leaf; we begin a new life under a New Master.
