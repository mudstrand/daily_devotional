CORRECTIONS_NEEDED Does this mean that women should not speak in church services today? It is clear from (1 Corinthians 11:5) that women prayed and prophesied in public worship. It is also clear in Chapters 12-14 that women are given spiritual gifts and are encouraged to exercise them in the body of Christ. Women have much to contribute and can participate in worship services. It may have been such a thing that the women were questioning the order of worship and causing disputes in the church that could have been settled at home. The purpose for Paul's words was to promote unity, not to teach about women's roles in the church. Remember, God is a God of order.
