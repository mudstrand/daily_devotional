Until this time, a complicated system of sacrifices had atoned for sins. Sin separates people from God, and only through the sacrifice of an animal, a substitute, could people be forgiven and become clean before God. But people sin continually, so frequent sacrifices were required. Jesus, however, became the final and ultimate sacrifice for sin. The word "finished" is the same as "paid in full." Jesus came to finish God's work of salvation (John 4:34; 17:4) to pay the full penalty for our sins. With His death, the complex sacrificial system ended because Jesus took all sin upon Himself. Now we can freely approach God because of what Jesus did for us. Those who believe in Jesus' death and resurrection can live eternally with God and escape the penalty that comes from sin. If you have not as of yet personally accepted what Christ did for you on the cross, you could be playing Russian roulette with your life. Let us seek the Lord while He may be found; let us call upon Him while He is near. Let us forsake our evil ways and thoughts. Let us turn to the Lord, and He will have mercy on us, and our God will freely pardon.
