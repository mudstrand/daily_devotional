the power to live as a Christian does not come from ourselves, it comes from the Holy Spirit. Because Christ died and rescued us from sin, we are free from sin's control. God gives us the power and understanding to live according to His will and to do good. Then we will look forward to Christ's wonderful return with eager expectation and hope. It is not enough to renounce sin and evil desires, we must also live actively for God. To fight against lust, we must say no to temptation, but we must also say yes to active service for Christ.
