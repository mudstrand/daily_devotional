It's natural to spend time thinking about where we'd like to be or what we'd like to have. But we must evaluate our desires to make sure they are consistent with what God says will truly satisfy. When our desires conform to God's will, we're not likely to waste our time wishing for things that can't satisfy. Real joy comes from wanting to be close to God. Real contentment comes when we realize God has everything we need.
