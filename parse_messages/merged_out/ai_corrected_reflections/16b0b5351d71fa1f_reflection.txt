What was the teacher thinking? His own disciples were alarmed and asked, "Who then can be saved?" Jesus replied, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God." (vs. 27) It takes courage and faith. "If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved." (Romans 10:9) Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved.
