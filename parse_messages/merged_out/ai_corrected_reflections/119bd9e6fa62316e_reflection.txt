Our troubles should not diminish our faith or disillusion us. We should realize that there is a purpose for our suffering. Problems and human limitations have several benefits: (1) They should remind us of Christ's suffering for us; (2) They should keep us from pride; (3) They should cause us to look beyond this brief life; (4) They should give us opportunities to prove our faith to others; and (5) They should give God the opportunity to demonstrate His power. Let us remember to see our troubles as opportunities.
