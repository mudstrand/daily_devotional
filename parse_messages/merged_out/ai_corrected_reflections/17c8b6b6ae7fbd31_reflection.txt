Having too much can be dangerous, but so can having too little. Being poor can, in fact, be hazardous to spiritual as well as physical health. On the other hand, being rich is not the answer. As Jesus pointed out, rich people have trouble getting into God's kingdom (Matthew 19:23,24). Like Paul, we can learn how to live whether we have little or a lot (Philippians 4:12), but our lives are more likely to be effective if we have neither poverty nor riches.
