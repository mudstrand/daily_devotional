When Christians preach the Good News, it is good news to some and repulsive news to others. Believers recognize the life-giving fragrance of the message. But to nonbelievers, it smells foul, like death—their own. Paul says, "Who is adequate" for the task of representing Christ? Well, our adequacy is always from God (1 Corinthians 15:10; 2 Corinthians 3:5). He has already commissioned and sent us (Matthew 28:18-20). He has given us His Holy Spirit to enable us to speak with Christ's power. He keeps His eyes on us, protecting us as we realize that God has equipped us; we can overcome our feelings of inadequacy. In our serving Christ, it requires that we focus on what He can do through us, not on what we can't do by ourselves.
