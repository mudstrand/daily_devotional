Preachers and teachers, and anyone else who talks about Jesus Christ must remember that they stand in God's presence. He hears every word. He also sees our every action. When you tell people about Christ, be careful not to distort the message to please those you are sharing it with. Proclaim the truth of God's Word and allow the Holy Spirit to do the rest.
