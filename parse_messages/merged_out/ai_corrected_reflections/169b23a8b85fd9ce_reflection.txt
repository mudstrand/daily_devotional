John tells us, "The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us. We have seen His glory." (John 1:14) Out of that eyewitness experience John also wrote, "We proclaim to you the one who existed from the beginning, whom we have heard and seen. He is the Word of life." (1 John 1:1). Like John, we can use our words to introduce others to Jesus, whom wind and water obey. Let us acknowledge the Creator to others, who knows and loves His creation.
