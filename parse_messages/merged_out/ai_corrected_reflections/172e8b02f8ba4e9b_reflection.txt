Why do we become discouraged, and forsake God? Often it is because we (like a tree) have begun to rot on the inside. The deterioration may have started with a little white lie or a small drink or forsaking the assembly to go fishing or camping. Long before our feet carry us where we should not go, and our hands do what they ought not do, the desire is in our hearts (Psalm 119:9-11). With a pure heart, we will be able to stand the stress of temptation and overcome discouragement. Remember, He will never leave you or forsake you!
