Let's not forget Acts 20:35, it says, "It is more blessed to give than to receive." Every day we have the opportunity to reach out in love to those around us. When we do this, we mirror Jesus's love for humanity. We fulfill His love for us. And in the blessing of others, we are blessed. Let us pray that Jesus will give us the opportunity to bless those around us.
