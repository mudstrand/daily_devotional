Jesus is speaking to those whose belief in Him is superficial. What Jesus is saying is that discipleship means accepting all of His teaching and to remain faithful to it. Only in Jesus and His teaching will anyone be free from sin, death, and Satan's rule, and so be free to serve God with a pure heart. In contrast, Judaism taught that the study of God's Law made a person free.
