Besides giving us Himself, the Spirit gives us wisdom, making us wise unto salvation; He gives us understanding, the ability to distinguish properly concerning things; He gives us counsel, or good advice from the counselor, for ourselves and to share with others; He gives us might, the power to prevail in and through faith; He gives us knowledge, knowing and believing in the true God and in Jesus Christ, whom He has sent; and finally, He gives us fear, which is not terror but proper respect for God and His Word.
