The cross reminds us of a drama of eternal scope. The work of Christ is a story of a loving God who pursues us and invites us to accept His offer of complete forgiveness. Jesus's death is rooted in history. His resurrection conquered and has an eternal impact for all of us. The cross will never lose its meaning or power.
