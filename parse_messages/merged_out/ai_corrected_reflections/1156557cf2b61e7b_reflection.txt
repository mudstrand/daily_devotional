God's ultimate goal for us is to make us like Christ (I John 3:2). As we become more and more like Him, we will discover our true selves, the person we were created to be. How can we become like Christ? By reading and heeding the Word, by studying His life on earth through the Gospels, by spending time in prayer, by being filled with His Spirit, and by doing His work in the world.
