I believe what we should recognize is a call for Christian maturity. Christian maturity means making Christ the being and end of our faith. To grow in maturity, we must center our lives on Christ, not depending on some religious ritual, not falling back into sin, or trusting in ourselves, and not letting anything come between us and Christ.
