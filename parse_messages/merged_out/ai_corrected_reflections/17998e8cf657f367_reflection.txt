If no human being can control the tongue, why bother trying? Even though we may not achieve perfect control of our tongues, the Holy Spirit will help us learn self-control. Remember that we are not fighting the tongues of fire in our own strength. The Holy Spirit will give us increasing power to monitor and control what we say, so that when we are offended, the Holy Spirit will remind us of God's love, and we won't react in a hateful manner.
