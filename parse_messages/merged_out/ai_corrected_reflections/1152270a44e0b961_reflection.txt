Of course, we know that the life-giving Spirit is the Holy Spirit. As we see by (Genesis 1:2), he was present at the creation of the world, and he is the power behind the rebirth of every Christian. He gives us the power we need to live the Christian life. If you wish to learn more about the Holy Spirit, see John 3:6, Acts 1:3-5.
