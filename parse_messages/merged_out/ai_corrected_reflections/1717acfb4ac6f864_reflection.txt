Jesus says that those who believe in Him have (not will have) eternal life. John, the author of this Gospel, has been demonstrating that Jesus is the true Son of God. Jesus sets before us the greatest choice in life. We are responsible to decide for ourselves whom we will obey. (Joshua 24:15), and God wants us to choose Him and live (Deuteronomy 30:15-20). The wrath of God is God's final judgment and rejection of sinners. To put off the choice is to choose not to follow Christ. The great divide comes down to choosing Christ and receiving eternal life or not believing and receiving the wrath of God. Indecision is a fatal decision, especially at a time when none of us know if we will be one of the next statistics.
