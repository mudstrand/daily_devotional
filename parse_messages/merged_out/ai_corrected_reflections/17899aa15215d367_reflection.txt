The resurrection of Jesus clearly demonstrated His conquest of death. Our Lord's resurrection also signals our freedom from sin and death. The prophet Isaiah had said of the Messiah that He would come to free captives from prison and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness" (Isaiah 42:7). This promise was brought to glorious fulfillment on Easter morning when Jesus rose from the dead.
