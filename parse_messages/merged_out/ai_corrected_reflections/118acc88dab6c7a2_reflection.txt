What Paul is saying is there is a proper place for the intellect in Christianity. In praying and singing, both the mind and the spirit should be fully engaged. When we sing, we should also be thinking about the meaning (message) in the words. When we pour out our feelings to God in prayer, we should not turn off our capacity to think. Let us remember, "True Christianity" is neither barren intellectualism nor thoughtless emotionalism.
