How often have we thought of the law as something that keeps us from having fun? Oh, excuse me—I guess that was when we were young and foolish! In these verses, we see just the opposite: God's law revives us, makes us wise, brings joy to our heart, gives insight, warns us, and rewards us. God's laws are guidelines and light our path, rather than chains on our hands and feet. They point at danger to warn us, then point at success to guide us.
