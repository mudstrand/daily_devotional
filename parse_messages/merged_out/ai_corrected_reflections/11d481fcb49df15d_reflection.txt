When someone gives you a gift, do you say, "That's very nice. Now how much do I owe you?" NO, the appropriate response to a gift is "Thank you!" Yet how often do Christians, even after they have been given the gift of salvation, feel obligated to try to work their way to God. Because our salvation and even our faith are gifts, we should respond with gratitude, praise, and joy.
