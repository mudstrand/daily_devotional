In saying that the Lord your God is God of all gods and Lord of lords, Moses was distinguishing the true God from all the local gods worshiped throughout the land. Then Moses went a step further, calling God "mighty and awesome." He has such awesome power and justice that people cannot stand before Him without His mercy. Fortunately, His mercy toward His people is unlimited. When we begin to grasp the extent of His mercy toward us, we see what true love is and how deeply God loves us. Although our sins deserve severe judgment, God has chosen to show love and mercy to all who seek Him.
