This verse is a positive and negative statement of the same truth. Clinging to this life may cause us to forfeit the best from Christ in this world and in the next. The more we love this world's rewards such as (leisure, power, popularity, financial security), the more we will discover how empty they really are. The best way to enjoy life, therefore, is to loosen our greedy grasp on earthly rewards so that we can be free to follow Christ. In doing so, we will inherit eternal life and begin at once to experience the benefits of following Christ.
