When Paul began spreading the Good News, God gave him the ability to speak effectively. Now we may not be apostles or even an evangelist, but God will give us the opportunity to tell others about Christ. With those opportunities, God will provide the ability, courage, and power. Whenever an opportunity presents itself, we need to make ourselves available to God as His servant. As we focus on another person and his or her needs, God will communicate your caring attitude. Your words will be natural, loving, and compelling.
