We should come to the Lord's Table desiring to fellowship with other believers and come in an attitude of faith that we are receiving the true body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. We should always partake of the Lord's Supper in the right frame of mind. We should never, ever, come to the Lord's Supper with a grudge against someone. If we don't forgive, how can we expect God to forgive us? When we pray the Lord's Prayer, don't we pray, "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us."
