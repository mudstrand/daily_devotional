God's grace to us led Christ to His death. Jesus did not come into the world to gain status or political power, but to suffer and die that we could have eternal life. If it is difficult for us to identify with Christ's servant attitude, perhaps we need to evaluate our own motives. Are we more interested in power or participation, domination or service, getting or giving? We need to make an honest effort to examine our motives.
