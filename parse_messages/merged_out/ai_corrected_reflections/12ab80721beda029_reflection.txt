STOP RIGHT NOW. Now turn in your Bible and read verses 2-4 of chapter 11. DO IT! Now, take notice of the order in this prayer. First, Jesus praised God. Then, He made His request. Praising God first puts us in the right frame of mind to tell Him about our needs. Think about it. Aren't our prayers often more like shopping lists than conversations with the Lord?
