What is being said is that God's ways and thoughts are too vast to measure. His ways and thoughts are beyond human understanding. Riches, Wisdom, knowledge. Riches are the wealth of God's grace and glory. The wisdom of God's purposeful actions in history to save, and His intimate knowledge of us is too deep for human beings to fathom.
