"Heart of a child," I think many tend to think of children as morally neutral at worst. But the Bible does not; it says we are born with a sinful nature. Godly education means not merely bringing the child's good talents to light but also driving out the bad. The Bible does approve of corporal punishment. However, it does not envision the sort of abuse that would maim or kill a child, but rather it promotes discipline that instructs.
