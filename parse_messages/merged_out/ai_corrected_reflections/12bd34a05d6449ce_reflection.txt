The Spirit of God witnesses to the redemption of our Lord, and nothing else. He cannot witness to our reason. Why? Because we are inclined to mistake the simplicity that comes from our natural common-sense decisions for the witness of the Spirit, but the Spirit witnesses only to His own nature, and to the work of redemption, never to our reason. If we are trying to make Him witness to our reason, it is no wonder that we are in darkness and uncertainty. Throw it all overboard, trust in Him, and He will give you the witness of the Spirit.
