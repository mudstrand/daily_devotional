LIVE GOD'S WORD - remember the Word of God is not simply a collection of words from God, a vehicle for communicating ideas; it is living, life-changing as it works in us. Like a surgeon's knife, God's Word reveals who we are and what we are not. It penetrates the core of our mortal and spiritual life. It discerns what is within us, both good and evil. The demands of God's Word require decisions. We must not only listen to the Word; we must also let it shape our life.
