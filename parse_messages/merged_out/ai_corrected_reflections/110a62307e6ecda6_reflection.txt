These verses point out the danger of the Hebrew Christians' returning to Judaism and thus committing apostasy. Some today apply this text to unbelievers who renounce their Christianity, or to unbelievers who come close to salvation and then turn away. Either way, those who reject Christ will not be saved. Christ died once for all. He will not be crucified again. Apart from His cross, there is no possible way of salvation. The author of this text is warning against the hardness of the heart that will make repentance inconceivable for the sinner.
