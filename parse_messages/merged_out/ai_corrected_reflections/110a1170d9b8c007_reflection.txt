Certain basic teachings are essential for all believers to understand. Those basics include: the importance of faith, the foolishness of trying to be saved by good deeds, the meaning of baptism and the spiritual gifts, and the facts of the resurrection and eternal life. To go on to maturity in our understanding, we need to move beyond (but not away from) the basic teachings to a more complete understanding of the faith. Mature Christians should be teaching new Christians the basics. Then, acting on what they know, the mature will learn even more from God's Word.
