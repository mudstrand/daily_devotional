Our attitudes can color our whole personality. We cannot always choose what happens to us, but we can choose our attitude toward each situation. The secret to a happy heart is filling our mind with thoughts that are true, pure, and lovely, with thoughts that dwell on the good things of life (Philippians 4:8). Maybe it's time to look at your attitude and then examine what you allow to enter into your mind and what you choose to dwell on. You may need to make some changes.
