Rituals did not earn any reward for Abraham; he had been blessed long before the circumcision ceremony was introduced. Abraham found favor with God by faith alone, before he was circumcised. Genesis 12:1-3 tells of God's call to Abraham when he was seventy-five years old. The circumcision ceremony was introduced when he was 99 (Genesis 17:1-4). Ceremonies and rituals serve as reminders of our faith as well as instruct new or young believers. BUT we should not think that they give us any special merit before God. They are meant to be outward signs and seals that demonstrate inner belief and trust. The focus of our faith should be on Christ and His saving work, not on our own actions.
