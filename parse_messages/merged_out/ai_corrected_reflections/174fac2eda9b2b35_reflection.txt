All Christians have faith. Some, however, have the spiritual gift of faith, which is an unusual measure of trust in the power of God. No matter what gifts a person has, each gift is given by the Holy Spirit. We are responsible to use and sharpen our gifts, but we can take no credit for what God has freely given us.
