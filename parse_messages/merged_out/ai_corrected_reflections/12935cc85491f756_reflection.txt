This inward struggle with sin was as real to Paul as it is with us. From Paul, we learn what to do about it. Whenever Paul felt lost, he would return to the beginning of his spiritual life, remembering that he had already been freed by Jesus Christ. When we feel confused and overwhelmed by sin's appeal, we need to follow Paul's example. Thank God that He has given us freedom through Jesus Christ. Today, let the reality of Christ's power lift you up to real victory over sin.
