"And for me" - What light these words cast on the deep reality of Paul's faith in the absolute necessity and the wonderful power of prayer. What a call to us in the twentieth century to awake to the consciousness that Christ our Intercessor in heaven and all God's children here upon the earth are engaged in one mighty contest, and that it is our duty to call out and to cultivate the gift of unceasing supplication for the power of God's Spirit in all His servants, that all may have divine utterances given them and that all may speak boldly and as they ought to speak.
