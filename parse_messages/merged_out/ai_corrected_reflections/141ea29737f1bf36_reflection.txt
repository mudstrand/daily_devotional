It goes without saying that we are surrounded by God's craftsmanship. The heavens give dramatic evidence of His existence—His power—His love—His care. To say that the universe happened by chance is absurd. As you look at God's handiwork in nature and the heavens, thank Him for such magnificent beauty and the truth it reveals about the Creator.
