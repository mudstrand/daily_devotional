There are times when the answers to my prayers don't come as quickly as I want them to, but it still surprises me when I experience instant relief from Jesus. The N.T. is filled with stories of how Jesus showed compassion to those who were suffering, and often they received their healing immediately. Whatever the circumstances, you should remember Jesus cares for all of us—men, women, young, old, privileged, and underprivileged. Jesus was crucified on the cross for the forgiveness of our sins and the healing of our sicknesses and diseases. In faith, we can cry out to Him and expect His healing touch. The pain may be gone right away, as it has happened to me at various times, or the healing may come much later. But one thing is certain: Jesus is always concerned with our well-being.
