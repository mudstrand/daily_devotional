Anger divides people. It pushes them into hasty decisions that only cause bitterness and guilt. But anger can be a legitimate reaction to injustice and sin. When you feel yourself getting angry, look for the cause. Or are you reacting to a personal insult? Pray that God will help you control a quick temper. Pray for humility and repentance.
