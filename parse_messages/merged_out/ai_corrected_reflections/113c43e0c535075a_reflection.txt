The words from Psalm 51:4b are very applicable here. When David acknowledged his guilt, he also acknowledged the righteous judgments of God and his own responsibility before the standards of God's law. Paul's assertion is that the judgments of God are truly righteous and just. When we look at the lives of great Bible men and others, we see a demonstration of man's nature; it is very evident that the description of man found in the Word of God is true.
