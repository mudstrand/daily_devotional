It is sad that this verse is misused by some as a loophole to get out of marriage. Paul's statements were given to encourage the Christian spouse to try and get along with the unbeliever and make the marriage work. But if the unbelieving spouse insists on leaving, Paul said to let him or her go. The only alternative would be for the Christian to deny his or her faith to preserve the marriage, and that would be worse than dissolving the marriage. Paul's chief purpose in writing this was to urge the married couples to seek unity, not separation. See (1 Corinthians 7:17; 1 Peter 3:1-2)
