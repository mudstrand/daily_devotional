What vs. 4 means is that if a person could earn right standing with God by being good, the granting of that gift wouldn't be a free act; it would be an obligation. When some people learn that they are saved by God through faith, they start to worry. "Do I have enough faith?" They wonder, "Is my faith strong enough to save me?" These people miss the point. It is Jesus Christ who saves us, not our feelings or actions, and He is strong enough to save us no matter how weak our faith is. Jesus offers us salvation as a gift because He loves us, not because we have earned it through the power of faith.
