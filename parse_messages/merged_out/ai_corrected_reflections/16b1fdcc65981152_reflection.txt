Remember, God has created each of us for a specific purpose. Primarily, that purpose is to bring honor to Him, and one way we do that is by meeting the needs of others. (1 Peter 4:10-11) Now, Psalm 139 says that before we were born, "All the days ordained for [us] were written in His book." (v. 16) We are "fearfully and wonderfully made" to bring glory to our Creator. (v. 14) Never forget: you have a purpose.
