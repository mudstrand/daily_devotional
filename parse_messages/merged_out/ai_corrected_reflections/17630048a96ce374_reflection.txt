Christianity is not limited to any race or group of people. Christ offers salvation to all people without regard to nationality. Visitors in Jerusalem were surprised to hear the apostles and other believers speaking in languages other than their own, the languages of other nationalities, but they didn't need to be, because God works all kinds of miracles to spread the Good News, using many languages as He calls all kinds of people to become His followers. No matter what your race, color, nationality, or language, God speaks to you. Are you listening to Him?
