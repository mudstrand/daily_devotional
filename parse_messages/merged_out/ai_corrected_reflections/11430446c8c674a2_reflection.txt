What can we do to get rid of guilt? King David was guilty of terrible sins--adultery, murder, lying--and yet he experienced the joy of forgiveness. We, too, can have this joy when we: (1) Quit denying our guilt and recognize that we have sinned, (2) Admit our guilt to God and ask for His forgiveness, and (3) Let go of our guilt and believe that God has forgiven us. This can be difficult when a sin has taken root in our life over many years, when it is very serious, or when it involves others. We must remember that Jesus is willing and able to forgive every sin. When we remember the tremendous price He paid on the cross, it is arrogant to think that there is any sin too great for Him to forgive.
