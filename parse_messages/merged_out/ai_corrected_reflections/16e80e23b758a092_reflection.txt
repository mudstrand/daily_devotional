Thoughts from Matthew Henry: When Matthew Henry was robbed, that very night he prayed: "I thank Thee, first because I was never robbed before; second, because although they took my purse, they did not take my life; third, because although they took my all, it was not much; and fourth, because it was I who was robbed, and not I who robbed." Let us practice this type of attitude.
