The Bible says that God is love (1 John 4:8). It also tells us that Jesus and His Father are one, which means Jesus is love. We are told to abide in, dwell in Him, which means immersing ourselves in that vast pool of love until it can be said of us: The good news is that the goal won't come in striving, but in diving in and becoming.
