What was/is Paul's reasoning for following his example? Remember—he did not think of himself as sinless, so he wasn't being arrogant. Well, we need to remember that at the time he said this to the Corinthian people, they didn't know about the life and ministry of Christ. Paul could not tell them to imitate Jesus because the Gospels hadn't been written yet, so they didn't know what Jesus was like. The best way to point these new Christians to Christ was to point them to a Christian whom they trusted, which we see in (Galatians 4:12; Philippians 3:17; 1 Thessalonians 1:6; 2:14).
