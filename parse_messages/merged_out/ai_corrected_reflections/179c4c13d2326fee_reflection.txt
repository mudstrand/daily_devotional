Jesus summarizes the law as love for God and neighbor (Matthew 22:37-40), and Paul said that love demonstrated toward your neighbor would fully satisfy the law (Romans 13:6-10). When we fail to love, we are actually breaking God's law. Take time to examine your attitude and actions toward others. Do you build people up or do you tear them down? When you are ready to criticize someone, remember God's law of love and say something good instead. Saying something beneficial to others will cure you of finding fault and increase your ability to obey God's law of love.
