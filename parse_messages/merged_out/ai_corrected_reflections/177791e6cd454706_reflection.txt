The Bible teaches the indwelling of the Triune God in believers. This divine indwelling in Christians is totally different from pagan enthusiasm, however. The apostles clearly stated that God's presence in our hearts comes "through faith." This faith in the atoning merit of Jesus Christ as our Savior is created and sustained only through means of grace: Word and sacraments. It is not based on human feelings or emotions but on the truths of God's Word.
