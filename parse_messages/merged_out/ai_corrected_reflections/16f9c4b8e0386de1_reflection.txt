Deep down, I know that each of us knows that Earth is not our true home. One day, Jesus will lead us to our forever home. Until then, I'm learning the joy of being in His presence. That's where I feel most at home. The next time you feel unsettled, go to Jesus in prayer. Ask Him to help you feel at home in Him.
