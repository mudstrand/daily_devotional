Obeying our parents is our main task when we are young, but honoring should continue even beyond their death. One way to honor our parents is to provide for them in times of financial need or when they are unable to care for themselves. One of the best ways to honor them is to pass on their godly values to our children. Are you truly living in a way that brings honor to your parents?
