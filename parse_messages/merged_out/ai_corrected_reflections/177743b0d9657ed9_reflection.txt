Do you ever think that you are not good enough for God, so He surely will not save you? Do you ever feel as if salvation is for everyone else? Then this verse is especially for you. If God gave His Son for the world, He isn't going to hold the gift of salvation from you! If Christ gave His life for you, He isn't going to turn around and condemn you! He will not withhold anything you need to serve Him. The book of Romans is an explanation of God's redeeming grace. It's meant to be a book of comfort and confidence, addressed to the person who is dealing with doubt.
