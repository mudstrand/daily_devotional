"What God has done" has special meaning in our lives. His great deeds for our salvation are crowned with His Son, Jesus Christ, who lived a life of obedience for us, died for us, and rose from the dead for us as foretold. From the Father and the Son comes the Holy Spirit to found the church and make us members of it by giving us saving faith. One divine promise remains: Christ's return in glory to take us home to the Father in Heaven.
