When people deliberately reject Christ's offer of salvation, they reject God's most precious gift. They ignore the leading of the Holy Spirit, the One who communicates to us God's saving love. This warning was given to the Jewish Christians who were tempted to reject Christ for another religion or, having understood Christ's atoning work. If anyone deliberately rejects the sacrifice of Christ after clearly understanding the Good News teaching about it, there is no way for that person to be saved, because God does not provide any other name in all of heaven for people to call on to save them.
