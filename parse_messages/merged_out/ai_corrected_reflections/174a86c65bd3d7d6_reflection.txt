Take note here, Jesus' words do not mean that we can automatically obtain anything we want if we just think positively. Jesus really meant that anything is possible if we believe, because nothing is too difficult for God. We cannot have everything we pray for as if by magic, but with faith, we can have everything we need to serve Him. No matter how much faith we have, we never reach the point of being self-sufficient.
