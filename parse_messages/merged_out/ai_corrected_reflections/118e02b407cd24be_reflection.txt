The resurrection of Christ is the central thought of the gospel message, and because Christ was raised from the dead as He promised, we know that what He said is true—He is God. Because He rose, we have the certainty that our sins are forgiven. Because He rose, He lives and represents us to God. Because He rose and defeated death, we know that we will also be raised.
