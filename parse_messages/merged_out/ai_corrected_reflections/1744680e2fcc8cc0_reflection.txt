Dear Lord! Kind Lord! Gracious Lord, I pray, Thou wilt look on all I love, Tenderly today! Weed their hearts of weariness; Scatter every care Down a wake of angel-wings Winnowing the air. Bring to the sorrowing All release from pain; Let the lips of laughter Overflow again; And with all the needy, O, divide, I pray, This vast measure of content That is mine today! James Whitcomb Riley, 1849-1916
