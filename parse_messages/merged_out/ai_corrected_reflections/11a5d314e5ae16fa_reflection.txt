Paul says that we should give of what we have, not what we don't have. Sacrificial giving must be responsible giving. Paul wants believers to give generously but not to the extent that those who depend on the givers (their families, for example) must go without having their basic needs met. Give until it hurts, but don't give until it hurts your family and/or relatives who need your financial support.
