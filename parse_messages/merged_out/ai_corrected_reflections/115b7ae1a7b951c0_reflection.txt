Paul adapts Moses' farewell challenge from Deuteronomy 30:11-14 to apply to Christ. Christ has provided our salvation through His incarnation (God in human form) and resurrection. God's salvation is right in front of us. He will come to you wherever you are. All you need to do is to respond and accept His gift of salvation.
