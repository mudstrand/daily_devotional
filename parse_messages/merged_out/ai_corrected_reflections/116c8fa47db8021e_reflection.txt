In this letter, you will find that Paul wrote some strong words to the Corinthians, but he begins on a positive note of thanksgiving. He affirms their privilege of belonging to the Lord and receiving His generous gifts: the power to speak out for Him and understand His truth. When we must correct others, it helps to begin by affirming what God has already accomplished in them.
