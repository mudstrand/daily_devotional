The message Mary delivered explains why Jesus said she shouldn't touch Him: "I have not yet returned to my Father." He was telling her that a relationship much closer than bodily contact is coming. Since Jesus has returned to the heavenly Father, He has sent the Holy Spirit as counselor, and we are now living in an intimate communion with Him. He lives in our heart, and we in Him. So, is it the same Christ that died for us and rose again? YES, but He is our Friend in a much fuller sense.
