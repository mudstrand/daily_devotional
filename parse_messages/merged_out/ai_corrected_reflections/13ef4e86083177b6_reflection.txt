This is not the work of one day or one night. It needs to be one with the will to take the time to do some serious thinking in regard to the state and the need of the body of Christ in which we belong. But once we begin, we will find numerous reasons for the persevering and yielding to the Holy Spirit—that He may fit us for the great and blessed work of day-by-day praying the twofold prayer, for the love of God and Christ to fill the hearts of His people and for the power of the Holy Spirit to come down and accomplish God's work in this sinful world.
