Have you noticed how the Bible connects the fear of the Lord (love and reverence) with obedience? "Fear God and obey His commandments" (Ecclesiastes 12:13). "All those who love Me will do what I say" (John 14:23). David said a person who fears the Lord doesn't lie, turns from evil, does good, and promotes peace. Reverence is much more than sitting quietly in church. It includes obeying God in the way we speak and in the way we treat others.
