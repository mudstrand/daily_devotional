There is someone who is strong and good, and who will one day right the wrongs in our world. When Jesus returns, he will come down from heaven with a group of powerful angels. He will give relief to you who are troubled, and he will not ignore those who have created problems for his children (1 Thessalonians 1:6-7). Until that day, Jesus wants us to stand firm and have courage.
