No one is ever going to be perfect here on Earth, so we must accept and love other Christians in spite of their faults. When we see faults in other believers, we should be patient and gentle. Is there someone whose actions or personality really annoys you? Rather than dwelling on that person's weakness or looking for faults, pray for him or her. Then do even more—spend time together and see if you can learn to like him or her.
