Think about this, do you think it's easier for God to love you when you're good? Do you secretly suspect that God chose you because you deserved it? Do you think that some people's behavior is so bad that God couldn't possibly save them? If you ever think this way, you don't entirely understand that salvation is by grace, a free gift. It cannot be earned, in whole or in part; it can only be accepted with thankfulness and praise.
