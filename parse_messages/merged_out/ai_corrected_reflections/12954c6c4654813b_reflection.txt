IF God stopped every kind of work on the Sabbath, nature would fall into chaos, and sin would overrun the world. Genesis 2:2 says that God rested on the seventh day, but this can't mean He stopped doing good. Because of His unity with God, Jesus lived as God wanted Him to live. Because of our identification with Jesus, we must honor Him and live as He wants us to. And so Jesus teaches that when the opportunity to do good presents itself, it should not be ignored, even on the Sabbath.
