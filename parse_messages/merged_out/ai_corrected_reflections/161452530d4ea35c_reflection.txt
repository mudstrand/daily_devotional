Do you sometimes feel as I do, that you aren't making any progress in your spiritual life? Scriptures tell us that when God starts a project, He completes it! As with the Philippians, Scripture also tells us God will help us grow in grace until He has completed His work in our life. When we become discouraged, let us pray for patience and remember that God has promised He will complete the work He has begun in us.
