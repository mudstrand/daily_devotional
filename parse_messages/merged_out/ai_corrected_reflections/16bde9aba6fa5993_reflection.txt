Sometimes we may feel that all the demands of life have depleted our strength and there is no one to replenish it. Others cannot replenish it, but God can. In Psalm 36 we read about God's lovingkindness. It describes those who put their trust in Him and are abundantly satisfied. God gives them water from His river of delight (vs. 8). He is the fountain of life. We can go to God every day to supply our needs. Let us be filled with His abundant supply, His fountain will never run dry. God's love is abundant.
