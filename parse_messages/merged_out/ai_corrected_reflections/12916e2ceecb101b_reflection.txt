I don't want to be a millionaire. I am one! ~ My bank account is nothing to brag about. My dollar and cents value is slight compared to many others. But I am rich, thanks to God's grace. What else would you call someone who has the riches of Christ's forgiveness to cover all his or her sins? who has the priceless pearl of peace with God through Jesus' blood? who carries in the portfolio of life God's grace to enrich him or her in every way. The gift of the Savior, of the gospel through which I learn of that Savior, of faith in that Savior—all this, Paul says, is due to the grace of God in Jesus Christ.
