He "predestined us" is another way of saying that salvation is God's work and not our own doing. In His infinite love, God has adopted us as His own children. Through Jesus' sacrifice, He has brought us into His family and made us heirs along with Jesus (Romans 8:17). In Roman law, adopted children had the same rights and privileges as biological children, even if they had been slaves. Paul uses this term to show how strong our relationship to God is. Have you entered into this relationship with God?
