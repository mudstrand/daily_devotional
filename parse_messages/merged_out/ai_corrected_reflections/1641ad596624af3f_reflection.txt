The old saying "A rotten apple spoils the whole barrel" is often applied to friendships, and with good reason. Our friends and associates affect us, sometimes profoundly. We need to be careful who we choose as our closest friends. We need to spend time with people who we would like to be like, because we and our friends will surely grow to resemble each other.
