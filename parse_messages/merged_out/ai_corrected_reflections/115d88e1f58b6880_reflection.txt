Yes, God chose the Jews ("His own people") to be the people through whom the rest of the world could find salvation. But this did not mean that the entire Jewish nation would be saved; only those who were faithful to God were considered true Jews (Romans 11:5). We are saved through faith in Christ, not because we are part of a nation, religion, or family. The question is, on whom or what are you trusting for salvation?
