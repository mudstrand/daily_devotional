The morning star is the one who rules the sky with royal splendor. So does Jesus. He who has won the victory over sin, death, and hell now rules over everything. His name is above every name; to Him every knee must bow. When He takes all who believe in Him to heaven, we'll not only see His glorious splendor but even share in it. With all other believers, we'll shine like a morning star at His side, not with our own brilliance but with the brilliance derived from Him, the true Morning Star.
