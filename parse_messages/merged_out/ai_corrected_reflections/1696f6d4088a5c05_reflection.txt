When the problems of life cloud our vision, we have an opportunity to learn to see our goal with eyes of faith. The N.T. letter to the Hebrews urges us to run with perseverance the race marked out for us. When we feel like quitting, this is our signal to remember not only what Jesus suffered for us but now helps us to endure—until the day we see Him face to face. We can finish strong when we focus on Him.
