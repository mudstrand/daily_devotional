We all face limitations of one sort or another. Some may have physical, some mental, others emotional disabilities. Some may be blind, but they still can see a new way to live. Some may be deaf, but they can hear God's good news. Some may be lame, but they can walk in God's love. In addition, they have the encouragement that those disabilities are only temporary. Paul tells us that we will all be given new bodies when Christ returns and that these bodies will be without disabilities, never to die or become sick. This can give us hope in our suffering.
