What happened to people who lived before Christ came and died for sin? If God condemned sinners, was He being unfair? If He saved the righteous, was Christ's sacrifice unnecessary? Paul shows that God forgave all human sin at the cross of Jesus. Old Testament believers looked forward in faith to Christ's coming and were saved, even though they did not know Jesus' name or the details of His earthly life. Unlike the Old Testament believers, you know about God who loved the world so much that He gave His own Son (John 3:16). Have you put your trust in Him?
