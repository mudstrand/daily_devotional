At times, it seems like God has let evil run rampant in the world, and we wonder if He even notices it. But God sees everything clearly—both the evil actions and the evil intentions lying behind them. He is not an indifferent observer. He cares and is active in the world. Right now, His work may be unseen and unfelt, but don't give up. One day, He will wipe out evil and punish evildoers.
