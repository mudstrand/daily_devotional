Abraham left all that he knew as he obeyed the Lord's call to live as a foreigner and stranger in a new land (Genesis 12:1). He pressed through the cultural challenges while keeping his faith in God, and 2,000 years later the writer to the Hebrews called him a hero. Perhaps you've always lived in the same town, but as Christ's follower you are still a foreigner or stranger on this earth. God calls us to live by faith. Pastor Al.
