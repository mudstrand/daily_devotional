Sin can deceive people by misleading them by the law. The law was holy, expressing God's nature and will for the people. In the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3), the serpent deceived Eve, changing her focus from the freedom she had to one restriction God had made. Ever since then, we have all been rebels. Sin looks good to us precisely because God has said it is wrong. Instead of paying attention to His warnings, we use them as the "to do" list. When we are tempted to rebel, we need to look at the law from a wider perspective—in the light of God's grace and mercy. If we focus on His great love for us, we will understand that He only restricts from actions and attitudes that harm us.
