Paul strongly denounces anyone who twists the teaching of the Good News of Jesus Christ. He says that even if an angel from heaven came preaching some other message, that angel should be "forever cursed." If an angel came preaching another message, he would not be from heaven, no matter how he looked. Paul at another time has warned that Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. Our message must never change, because the Good News never changes.
