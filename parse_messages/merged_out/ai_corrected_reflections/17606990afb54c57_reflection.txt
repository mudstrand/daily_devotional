Notice the parallel between the ram offered on the altar as a substitute for Isaac and Christ offered on the cross as a substitute for us. Whereas God stopped Abraham from sacrificing his son, God did not spare His own Son, Jesus, from dying on the cross. If Jesus had lived, the rest of humankind would have died. God sent His only Son to die for us so that we can be spared from the eternal death we deserve and instead receive eternal life (John 3:16). Did you remember to give thanks, Thanksgiving Day, for this undeserved gift of eternal life?
