When people gathered for the offering of sacrifice on the Day of Atonement, they were reminded of their sins, and they undoubtedly felt guilty all over again. What they needed most was forgiveness--the permanent, powerful, sin-destroying forgiveness we have from Christ. When we confess a sin to Him, we need never think of it again. Christ has forgiven us, and the sin no longer exists. (see 1 John 1:9).
