God brings us back to Himself by blotting out our sins. (Read Ephesians 2:13-18) When we trust in Christ, we are no longer God's enemies or strangers or foreigners to Him. Because we have been reconciled to God, we have the privilege of encouraging others to do the same, and thus we are among those who have "the task of reconciling others to Him."
