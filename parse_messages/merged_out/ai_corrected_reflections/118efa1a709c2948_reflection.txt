Even though God the Father and God the Son are equal, each has a special work to do and an area of sovereign control (15:28). Christ is not inferior to the Father, but His work is to defeat all evil on the earth. First, He defeated sin and death on the cross, and in the end, He will defeat Satan and all evil. World events may seem to be out of control, and justice may seem to have vanished. But God is in control, allowing evil to remain for a time until He sends Jesus to Earth again. Then He will present to God a perfect new world.
