It's easy to tell someone your sins are forgiven; it's a lot more difficult to reverse a case of paralysis! Jesus backed up His words by healing the man's legs. Jesus' action showed that His words were true; He had the power to forgive as well as heal. Talk is cheap, but our words lack meaning if our actions do not back them up. We can say we love God or others, but if we are not taking practical steps to demonstrate that love, our words are empty and meaningless. How well do your actions back up what you say?
