Life is short. David reminds us that it is "like a breath" and that "our days are like a passing shadow." James says our life is "like the morning fog—it's here a little while, then it's gone" (James 4:14). Now, because life is short, we need to live for God while there is time. We should not waste our life by selecting an inferior purpose that has no lasting value. Only God can make your life worthwhile, purposeful, and meaningful.
