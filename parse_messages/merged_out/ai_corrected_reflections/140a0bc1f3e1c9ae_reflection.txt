God cannot condone or even excuse the smallest sin, so we cannot excuse ourselves for sinning only a little bit. As we grow spiritually, our sensitivity to sin will also increase. What is your reaction to sin in your life? Are you insensitive, unconcerned, disappointed, or comfortable? As God makes us aware of sin, we must be intolerant toward it and be willing to change. All believers should strive to be more tolerant of people, but less tolerant of the sins in others and themselves.
