No one is free from sin. As soon as we confess our sins and repent, sinful thoughts and actions begin to creep into our life. We all need ongoing cleansing, moment by moment. Thank God He provides forgiveness by His mercy when we ask for it. Make confession and repentance a regular part of your talks with God. Rely on Him moment by moment for the cleansing you need.
