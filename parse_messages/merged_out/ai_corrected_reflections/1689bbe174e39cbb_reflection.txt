Let's look to Psalm 4 for some answers. Vs. 1 says: we should ask the Lord for relief. Vs. 3 says we can find comfort in knowing we are among those who are favored by God. Vs. 4 says we can acknowledge our feelings and be quiet before Him. Vs. 5 says we can do right. Vs. 7 says we need to trust Him to give us overflowing gladness. Vs. 8 says we can rest in the assurance of His peace and safety. Remember, a heart touched by grace should bring joy to the face.
