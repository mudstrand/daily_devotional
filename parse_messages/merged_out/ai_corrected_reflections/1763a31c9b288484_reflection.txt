When we turn from sin, God promises not only to cleanse us of sins but to bring spiritual refreshment. Turning away from sin may at first seem painful because it is hard to break old habits and give up certain sins. But God will give you a better way, as Hosea promised, "Oh that we might know the Lord! Let us press on to know Him! Then He will respond to us as surely as the rising of the sun or the coming of the rains in early spring." (Hosea 6:3). Do you feel a need to be refreshed?
