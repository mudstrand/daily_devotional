The question that is often asked, "What is the good life?" 'Is it prosperity, popularity, pleasure?' No, it is the life we receive from Jesus, including gifts that we cannot make or purchase: forgiveness, love, peace, and thankfulness. Jesus' life fills us with virtues rather than vices and enables us to be a blessing rather than a ruin to others. Before the dawning of the final day, let sin's dark deeds be gone!
