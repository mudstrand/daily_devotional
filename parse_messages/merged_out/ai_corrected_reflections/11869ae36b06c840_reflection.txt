WHEN PAUL SAID THAT NO ONE SHOULD TAKE THE LORD'S SUPPER UNWORTHILY, HE WAS SPEAKING TO THE CHURCH MEMBERS WHO WERE PARTICIPATING IN IT WITHOUT THINKING OF ITS MEANING. THOSE WHO DID AND STILL DO ARE "GUILTY OF SINNING AGAINST THE BODY AND THE BLOOD OF THE LORD." INSTEAD OF HONORING HIS SACRIFICE, WE ARE SHARING IN THE GUILT OF THOSE WHO CRUCIFIED CHRIST. IN REALITY, NO ONE IS WORTHY TO TAKE THE LORD'S SUPPER. WE ARE ALL SINNERS SAVED BY GRACE. THIS IS WHY WE SHOULD PREPARE OURSELVES FOR COMMUNION THROUGH HEALTHY INTROSPECTION, CONFESSION OF SIN, AND A TRUE RESOLUTION OF DIFFERENCES WITH OTHERS. THESE ACTIONS REMOVE THE BARRIERS THAT AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRIST AND WITH OTHER BELIEVERS. AWARENESS OF YOUR SINS SHOULD NOT KEEP YOU AWAY FROM THE COMMUNION TABLE BUT DRIVE YOU TO CONFESS AND THEN DRIVE YOU TO PARTICIPATE.
