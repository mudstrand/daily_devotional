These verses are a message of hope to people who must work under unjust, domineering leaders. It is also a warning to those who enjoy ruling with an iron hand. Sometimes God intervenes and directly destroys tyrants. More often, though, He uses other rulers to overthrow them or their own oppressed people to rebel against them. If you are in a position of authority in church, work, or home, remember what happens to tyrants. Leadership through kindness is more effective and longer-lasting than leadership by force.
