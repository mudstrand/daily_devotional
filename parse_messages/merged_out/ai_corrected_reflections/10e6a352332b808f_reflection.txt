Pilate was cynical; he thought that all truth was relative. To many government officials, truth was whatever the majority of people agreed with or whatever helped advance their personal power and political goals. When there is no basis for truth, there is no basis for moral right or wrong. Justice becomes whatever works or whatever helps those in power. In Jesus and His Word, we have a standard for truth and for our moral behavior.
