Some of the Judaizers were emphasizing circumcision as proof of holiness, but were ignoring the other Jewish laws. People today too often choose certain principles or prohibitions and make them the measure of faith. Some may frown on drunkenness but ignore gluttony. Others may despise promiscuity but tolerate prejudice. The Bible in its entirety is our rule of faith and practice. We cannot pick and choose the mandates we will follow.
