None of us are what we should be, but we can, like the apostle, pray and press on toward that goal. Like Paul we will always say, "I have not yet arrived." Nevertheless, despite weakness, failure, and weariness, we must press on (vs. 12). But everything depends on God. Without Him we can do nothing. Remember, God is with you, calling you onward, so keep paddling.
