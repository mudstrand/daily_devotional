Much more than Jeremiah, Jesus was the victim of character assassination. Amid lies and deceit, the King of kings was betrayed into enemy hands. The assassin did not use a sword to deliver Jesus to His death. He attacked Jesus with the tongue when he asked the authorities, "What are you willing to give me if I hand Him over to you?" (Matthew 26:15). In contrast, Christians "call on [Jesus] in every trouble, pray, praise, and give thanks."
