Separation from the world involves more than keeping our distance from sinners; it means staying close to God. It involves more than avoiding worldly entertainment; it extends to how we spend our time and money. There is no way to separate ourselves totally from all sinful influences. But we are to resist the sin around us, without giving up or giving in. (A New Year's Resolution) Let us make a clean break with our past and give ourselves to God.
