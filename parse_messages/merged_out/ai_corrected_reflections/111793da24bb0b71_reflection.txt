Cain and Abel were Adam and Eve's first two sons. Abel offered a sacrifice that pleased God, while Cain's sacrifice was unacceptable. Abel's sacrifice (an animal substitute) was more acceptable to God, both because it was a blood sacrifice and, most important, because of Abel's attitude when he offered it. What is your attitude when you bring your offering to God? Is it one of gratefulness because of what God has done for you? Or do you give grudgingly and stingily?
