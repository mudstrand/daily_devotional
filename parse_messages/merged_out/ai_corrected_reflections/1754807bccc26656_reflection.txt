Throughout the Bible, we find this phrase: "Don't be afraid." God wasn't trying to scare the people. He was showing His mighty power so the Israelites would know He was the true God, and they would therefore obey Him. If they would do this, He would make His power available to them. God wants us to follow Him out of love rather than fear. To overcome fear, we must think more about His love. 1 John 4:18 says, "Perfect love expels all fear."
