In the O.T., access to God in the tabernacle and the temple was strictly limited. Only priests could go in through the curtain and offer sacrifices in the holy place. Now, because of Christ's sacrifice for our sins, all those who love and follow Him can come into His presence at any time. He has given us the right of access.
