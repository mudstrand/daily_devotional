We often say that we have faith in God—but do we fully trust Him? David said, "Into your hand I commit my spirit," this truly conveys his trust in God the Father. Stephen repeated these words as he was being stoned to death, confident that in his death he was simply passing from God's earthly care to God's eternal care. We should commit our possessions, our families, and our vocations to God. But first and foremost, we should commit ourselves completely to Him.
