Loneliness can make us feel unseen by others—and maybe even by God. But we must remind ourselves that even though we may feel forgotten by our Creator God, we are not. God not only made us in His image (Genesis 1:26-27), but He also values each of us. Even in our darkest hours, we can rest in the knowledge that we are never alone, for our loving God is with us. If we weren't deeply loved, would God have sent His Son to save us?
