What a wonderful thought! God, the creator of all things, invites us mere creatures to pray, and He assures us that He will hear. Great things can happen when we pray. We are commanded to pray by the one who loves us. We show Him our love by keeping His commandments. Yet, knowing all this, many of us pray so little! Let us pray more in 2021 so that things will be better than they were in 2020.
