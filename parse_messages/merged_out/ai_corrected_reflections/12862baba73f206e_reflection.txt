The power from the Holy Spirit is not limited to strength beyond the ordinary. That power also involves courage, boldness, confidence, insight, ability, and authority. The disciples would need all these gifts to fulfill their mission. If you believe in Jesus Christ as your Savior, you can also experience the power of the Holy Spirit in your life. Remember, witnessing is not showing what we can do for God. It is showing and telling what God has done for us.
