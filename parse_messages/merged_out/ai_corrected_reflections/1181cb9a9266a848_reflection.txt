CORRECTIONS_NEEDED Like the Corinthians, we are living in a culture that is morally depraved with sin-inducing pressures. Paul has some encouragement. He says: (1) Temptations happen to everyone, so don't feel you have been singled out. (2) Others have resisted temptation, and so can you. (3) Any temptation can be resisted because God will show you a way out. God will help you in resisting temptation by helping you: (1) Recognize those people and situations that give you trouble. (2) Run from anything you know is wrong. (3) Choose to do only what is right. (4) Pray for God's help, and (5) seek friends who love God and can offer help when you are tempted. Running from a tempting situation is your first step on the way to victory. (See 2 Timothy 2:22.) Remember, temptation is not sin. Jesus was tempted three times in the desert. Temptation only becomes a sin when you give into it. But, in the same token, do not flirt with temptation. As Paul says, run from it.
