It is easy to be happy when everything is going your way, but how you respond to dark and difficult times is a test of true character. In our verse today, despite their suffering, Paul and Silas praise God. They worship in the worst of circumstances and inspire others by their actions. Dear Lord, help me to hold on to faith when suffering pain or encountering other difficulties, so that I may be a testimony to your glory.
