These verses summarize the lives of great men and women of faith. Some experienced outstanding victories, even over the threat of death. But there were those who were severely mistreated, tortured, and even killed. Having a steadfast faith in God does not guarantee a happy, carefree life. On the contrary, our faith almost guarantees us some form of abuse from the world. While we are on the earth, we may never see the purpose of our suffering. But we know that God will keep His promise to us. Do you believe that God will keep His promise to you?
