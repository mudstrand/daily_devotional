May the Christmas cheer remind you of Him who said, "Be of good cheer." May the Christmas bells remind you of the glorious proclamation of His birth. May the Christmas carols remind you of the song the angels sang, "Glory to God in the highest." May the Christmas season remind you in every way of Jesus Christ, your King.
