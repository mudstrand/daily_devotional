Roman soldiers in charge of the crucified customarily took for themselves the clothes of the condemned men. They divided Jesus' clothing, throwing dice to determine who would get His seamless garment, the most valuable piece of clothing. This fulfilled the prophecy in Psalm 22:18. Are you gambling away your eternal life, by saying "one day" when you get older? What will happen if the Lord calls before you get any older? What happens is, you will spend eternity separated from the Lord. Isaiah 55:6 tells us: "Seek the Lord while He may be found; call upon Him while He is near."
