What a promise this is to those who love Christ! We can triumph over sin's power and death's threats through the power of Jesus Christ. Let's also look at Romans 8:17: Now if we are His children, then we are heirs, heirs of God and co-heirs of Christ, if indeed we share in His sufferings in order that we may share in His glory. There is a price for being identified with Christ, but also there is a great treasure.
