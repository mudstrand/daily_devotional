When we are not motivated by love, we become critical of others. We stop looking for the good in them and see only their faults. Soon the unity of believers is broken. Have you talked about someone behind their back? Have you been focusing on the shortcomings of others instead of their strengths? You need to remind yourself of Jesus' commandment to love others as you love yourself (Matthew 22:39). When you begin to feel critical of someone, make a list of the person's positive qualities. If there are problems that need to be addressed, it is better to confront in love than to gossip.
