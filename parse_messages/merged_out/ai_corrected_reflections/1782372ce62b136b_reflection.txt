Christ suffered especially on Good Friday when people rejected His message. Every step of the road to Calvary was paved with unbelief. He confessed before the high priest and council that He was the Christ, the Son of the Highest, and before Pilate He testified to the truth of His kingdom—but no one would believe Him. For every Christian since, it comes down to this: Do we believe it? God grant that we do!
