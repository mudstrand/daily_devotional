"To Make All People See" was Paul's purpose in preaching the unsearchable riches of Christ. He would cause all men to see by turning the light on. Paul was aiming at spiritual enlightenment and spiritual apprehension. The stewardship of the worldwide proclamation of Christ and His gospel should be the aim of all believers.
