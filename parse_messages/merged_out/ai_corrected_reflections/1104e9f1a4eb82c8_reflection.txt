Yes, God did rest on the seventh day, but not because He was tired, but to indicate the completion of creation. The world was perfect, and God was well pleased with it. This rest is a foretaste of our eternal joy when creation will be renewed and restored, every mark of sin will be removed, and the world will be made perfect again. Our Sabbath-rest in Christ begins when we trust in Him to complete His good and perfect work in us.
