It is difficult to know when God has been disciplining us until we look back on the situation later. Not every calamity comes from God, of course. But if we rebel against God and refuse to repent when God has identified some sin in our life, He may use guilt, crises, or bad experiences to bring us back to Him. Sometimes, however, difficult times come even when there is no flagrant sin in our life. Then our response should be patience, integrity, and confidence that God will show us what to do.
