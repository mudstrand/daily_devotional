The picture of the law as a guardian is similar to a tutor giving a young child supervision. We no longer need that kind of supervision. The Law teaches us our need of salvation, and God's grace gives us that salvation. The Old Testament still applies today. In it, God reveals His nature, His will for humanity, His moral laws, and His guidelines for living. But we cannot be saved by the law; we must trust in Christ.
