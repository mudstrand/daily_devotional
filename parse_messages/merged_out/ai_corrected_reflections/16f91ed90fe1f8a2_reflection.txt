Following in the footsteps of Jesus doesn't involve a checklist. True discipleship requires interacting with Him constantly: remembering His teaching, listening for His direction, opening our eyes to where He is at work in our home and community. Remember, as Jesus meets us where we are, He shows us new ways to apply those truths as we follow Him.
