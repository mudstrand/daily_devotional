Imagine never worrying about anything! It seems like an impossibility. We all have worries on the job, in our homes, at school. But Paul advises us to turn our worries into prayers. Would you like to worry less? Then pray more! Whenever you start to worry, stop and pray, giving thanks for all that God has done in the past and what He promises to do in the future.
