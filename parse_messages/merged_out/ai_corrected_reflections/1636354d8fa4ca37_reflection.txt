These verses contrast two paths in life, but are not intended to apply universally to all people in all circumstances. God's people are not excluded from problems or struggles. If a person follows God's wisdom, however, God can rescue them from trouble. But a wicked person will fall into their own traps. The good person may suffer, but they can be sure they will ultimately be rescued from eternal death.
