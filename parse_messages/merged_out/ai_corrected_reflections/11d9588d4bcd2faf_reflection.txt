A fact that we need to remember is that God has called each of us to be Christ's representatives on earth. In light of this truth, Paul challenges us to live lives worthy of the calling we have received. What an awesome privilege to be called Christ's very own. This includes being humble, gentle, patient, understanding, and peaceful. People are watching our every action. Can they see Christ in your life? How well are you doing as His representative?
