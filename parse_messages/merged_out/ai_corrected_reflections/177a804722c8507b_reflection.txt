As human sinfulness remains constant, so does our need for God's saving grace in Christ remain constant. God's new covenant with us, which is the character of our salvation, offers full coverage. None is excluded; none is told that he is only fractionally redeemed (perhaps three-fifths) and that he must make up the rest himself. There is no balance due, as though Christ pays a certain amount of your debt and you are responsible for the rest. No, Jesus died to bring each one of us salvation, full and free.
