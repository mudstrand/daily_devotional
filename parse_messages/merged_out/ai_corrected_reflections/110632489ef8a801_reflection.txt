Nothing can be hidden from God. He knows about everyone, everywhere, and everything about us is wide open to His all-seeing eyes. God sees all we do and knows all we think. Even when we are unaware of His presence, He is there. When we try to hide from Him, He sees us. We can have no secrets from God. But it is comforting to realize that although God knows us intimately, He still loves us.
