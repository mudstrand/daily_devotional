Paul uses the illustration of our being rooted in Christ. Just as plants draw their nourishment from the soil through their roots, so we draw our life-giving strength from Christ. The more we draw our strength from Him, the less we will be fooled by those who falsely claim to have life's answers. While we are in the season of remembering, let us pause to praise and pray, giving thanks from our hearts.
