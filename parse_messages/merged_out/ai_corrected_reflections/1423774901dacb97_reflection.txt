Be assured that God's loving concern does not begin on the day we are born and end on the day we die. It reaches back to the days before we were born and reaches ahead along the unending path of eternity. Truly, our only sure help comes from a God whose concern for us reaches beyond our earthly existence. How can anyone reject such love?
