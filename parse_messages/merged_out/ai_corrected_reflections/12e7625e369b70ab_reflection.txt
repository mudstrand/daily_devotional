I love you, LORD, my strength. The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold. The LORD is: Our Strength. Our Rock. Our Fortress. Our Deliverer. Our Refuge. Our Shield. Our Stronghold. The Horn of Our Salvation. What more do we need?
