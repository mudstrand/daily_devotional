God gives us strength for those times when we are weak and fearful. He provides it for each day and for every difficulty. God also gives peace to guard the door of our heart in the midst of trials. Are you facing some emotional crises? Turn it over to God. You'll have many trying days, but He will give you the strength to go on and the peace to comfort your soul. Claim the double promise of (Psalm 29:11) as your own. The secret of peace is to give all your anxieties to God.
