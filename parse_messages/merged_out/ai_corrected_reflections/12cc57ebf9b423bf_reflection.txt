Let us never forget that Jesus has power over life and death as well as the power to forgive sins. This is because He is the creator of life (John 14:6). He who is life can surely restore life. Whoever believes in Christ has a spiritual life that death cannot conquer or diminish in any way. When we come to realize His power and how wonderful His offer to us really is, how can we not commit our lives to Him? To those of us who believe, what a wonderful assurance and certainty we have: "I will live again, and you will too" (John 14:19b).
