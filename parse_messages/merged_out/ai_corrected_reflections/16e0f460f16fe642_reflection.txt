This account illustrates the twofold aspect of sin: original and actual. The former is a condition, the latter its enactment. The Apostle Paul wrote that nothing good dwells in our inner nature, and this pre-conversion hatred and persecutions of Christians prove it. Paul taught what Jesus stressed: "Flesh gives birth to flesh" (John 3:6) and "Out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander" (Matthew 15:19). But there is salvation. Jesus, the sinless Son of God, was made to be sin for us that we by faith might be made righteous in God's sight. How wonderful is God's forgiving grace: "Where sin increased, grace increased all the more" (Romans 5:20).
