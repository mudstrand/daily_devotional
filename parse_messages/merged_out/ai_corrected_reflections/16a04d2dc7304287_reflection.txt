When God rescued the children of Israel from Egyptian captivity, He promised to lead them to a "land flowing with milk and honey" (Exodus 3:8, 17), a metaphor for abundance. God still uses honey to remind us that His ways and words are sweeter than the honeycomb (Psalm 19:10). So then the words we speak should also be like the honey we eat, both sweet and healing.
