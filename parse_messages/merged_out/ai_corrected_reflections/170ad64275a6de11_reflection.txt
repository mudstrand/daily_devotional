From the context of this passage, it's obvious "dressed" doesn't mean wearing an apron at all times or dressing in what used to be called our "Sunday best" in case Jesus returns before our next breath. But it seems clear He meant it to include any time He calls on us, not just when He calls us home. Let us spend time today considering how we can be royal-ready for whatever He requires.
