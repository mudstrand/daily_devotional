Wow! What a Valentine's Day present! Actually, two presents. 1. God gave His only Son as a sacrificial gift to deliver the world from condemnation, and 2. to give eternal life to those who believe in Him. When we continue in an immoral lifestyle, we naturally resist His divine disclosure of our sin and thus our need for a Savior. Let us not flee the light, but repent. God has revealed His strong love in His Son, Jesus Christ, to forgive your sins and give you life.
