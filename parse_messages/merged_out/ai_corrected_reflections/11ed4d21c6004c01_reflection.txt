I think that we all know many small men. Now I'm not talking about small in stature, but men who think little, talk little, plan little. They remind us of eagles staked to the ground; there's no soar to them. Their ceiling is zero, and their horizons are pulled in to the hub. I'm not saying that these men are selfish (some of course are), but it's just that they are preoccupied most of the time with their own little area of knowledge. They don't allow their minds to stretch and breathe. They don't think, they just rearrange their prejudices. These people are indifferent to problems other than their own. They have no concern for those things which do not hold a personal reference. They refuse to be bothered. We live in times which demand big men, not men who are big shots (they're useless), but men who are big in heart and mind. Great men! Large-souled men! We need men with a vision, whose feet are on the ground, but whose eyes are on the far horizon. Men whose hearts God has touched. Men committed, dedicated to God and His holy and high purpose! Men of integrity!
