Personal Christianity calls for efforts prompted by love for Christ. It makes us willing to sacrifice and surrender so Christ may be glorified. It prompts us to be diligent in prayer and in every response to God's great gift of salvation in Jesus. Christianity comes easy for those who love the Savior, who invites us: "Come to me . . . for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light" (Matthew 11:28-30).
