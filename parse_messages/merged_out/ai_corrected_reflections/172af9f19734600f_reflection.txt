Even though we start out with good intentions, sometimes our faith falters. This doesn't mean we have failed. When Peter's faith faltered, he reached out to Christ, the only one who could help. He was afraid, but he still looked to Christ. When you are apprehensive about the troubles around and doubt Christ's presence or ability to help, remember that He is always with you and is the only one who can really help. Don't look at the storms of life, but look to Jesus, and He will rescue you.
