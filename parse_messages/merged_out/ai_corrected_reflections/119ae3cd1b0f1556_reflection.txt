Paul reminds us that though we may feel we are at the end of our rope, we are never at the end of hope. Our perishable body is subject to sin and suffering, but God never abandons us. Because Christ has won the victory over death, we have eternal life. All our risks, humiliation, and trials are opportunities for Christ to demonstrate His power and presence in and through us.
