Paul prayed that God would remove his affliction, but God did not do it because He wanted to demonstrate His power through Paul. The fact that God's power is displayed in our weakness should give us courage and hope. As we recognize our limitations, we will depend more on God for our effectiveness rather than on our own energy, effort, or talent. Our limitations not only help develop Christian character but also deepen our worship, because in admitting them, we affirm God's strength.
