There are some days when I just want things to be the way they were before the COVID-19, before the restrictions and constraints, before the long list of don'ts and can'ts. It would be nice to have a sit-down dinner in a restaurant with friends without a mask. But when I pray about these feelings, God's Word reminds me that God's plan for our lives is to keep us moving forward, never backward. (Let us pray.) Lord, help us to accept that things are going according to Your plan, and that You will give us the strength to go forward.
