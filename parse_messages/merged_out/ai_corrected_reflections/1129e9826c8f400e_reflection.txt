God has given us the true Gospel. He has bestowed His grace upon us. He has placed before us the wonders of creation testifying to His majesty. He has given us His Son to become our brother, mediator, and redeemer. He met every demand of the law and offered His blood to redeem us from sin and the curse. He has given us His Word, telling us all about it. Day by day, He sends His Holy Spirit to nurture the life of godliness within us. But there are many who still follow their own desires, disregarding God's Word and His will. But God will deal with them according to the words of this text.
