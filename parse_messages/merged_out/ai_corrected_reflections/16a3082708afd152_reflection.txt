Our eyes are precious and fragile. They need protecting, and that's how the Lord loves and wants to protect His people, by holding them close to His heart. The Lord who dwells in our midst pours out His love on us—even, amazingly, far more than a loving mother who does all she can for an ailing child. A parent's love for a child reflects our Father's love for us.
