Something we may give very little thought to is: "Prayer is sacrifice." Our prayer has its worth alone from being rooted in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. As He gave up everything in His prayer: "Thy will be done," our posture and disposition must be the offering up of everything to God in His service. Need we wonder at the lack of power in our prayer where there is so much reluctance to make the needful sacrifice in waiting upon God?
