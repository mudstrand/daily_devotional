Yes, He was crucified, the most horrible death that was ever afflicted upon another human being. The sign that Pilate had placed about Jesus' head read, "JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS," was meant to be a mockery. A king stripped nearly naked and executed in public view would seemingly cause most to believe that He had lost His kingdom forever. BUT Jesus, who turns the world's wisdom upside down, was just coming into His Kingdom. His death and resurrection would strike the deathblow to Satan's rule and would establish Jesus' eternal authority over the earth. Few people reading the sign that bleak afternoon understood its real meaning, but the sign was absolutely true. All was not lost. Jesus was King of the Jews, and the Gentiles, and of the whole world. Have you accepted Him as your King?
