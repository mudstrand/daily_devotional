Jesus understands our fears and problems, so when we describe our struggles to Him, He doesn't brush us aside, He doesn't minimize our feelings, or tell us to snap out of it. He relates to our distress. Somehow, knowing that He understands can dispel the loneliness that often accompanies suffering. In our darkest times, He is our light and our salvation.
