Because Jesus triumphed, the "roaring lion" - the devil - has no power over us (1 Peter 5:8). Because he is still "looking for someone to devour" (1 Peter 5:8), we need to be watchful and alert. Peter cautioned, "Resist him, standing firm in the faith" (1 Peter 5:8). Satan's kingdom is destroyed, but cleanup continues. Thanks be to God that we are safe in Christ's kingdom!
