The Hebrews believed that a long life was a sign of God's blessing; so, gray hair and old age were good. While young people glory in their strength, old people can rejoice in their years of experience and practical wisdom. Gray hair is not a disgrace to have; it is a crown of splendor. As you deal with older people, treat them with respect.
