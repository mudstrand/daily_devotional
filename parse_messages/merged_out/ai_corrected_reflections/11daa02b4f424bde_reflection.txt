The "lowly world" may be: (1) the earth itself (lowly by comparison to heaven), (2) the grave, or (3) Hades (many believe Hades is the resting place of souls between death and resurrection). However we understand it, Christ is Lord of the whole universe, past, present, and future. Nothing or no one is hidden from Him. The Lord of all came to earth and faced death to rescue all people; no one is beyond His reach. Any view of God that violates either His transcendence or His immanence does not paint a true picture of God.
