What is the greatest blessing we enjoy in our earthly families? It's love, isn't it? If love is absent, we can have the best of food and clothing, you name it, and yet we have nothing. As believers, our self-worth is based on the fact that God loves us and calls us His children. Yes, we are His children now, not sometime in the distant future. Yes, we are members of God's family, His children. And, knowing that we are His children should encourage us to live as Jesus did. The Christian life is a process of becoming more and more like Christ. (Romans 8:29)
