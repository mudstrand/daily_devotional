How many of us have been guilty of praying only in a crisis? How many of us have a "quick fix" mentality that sees God mainly as a problem solver? And when merciful solutions come, He is courteously thanked, then more or less forgotten until the next crisis. If you read Psalm 106:1-15, you will see that it contains a serious warning against dismissing God from our lives—as if that was possible. Anticipate great things from God, but don't expect Him to come at your beck and call. Instead, be at His beck and call, eager to fulfill His will. Ask God to accompany you through life's dark pathways. But instead of dismissing Him when your special needs are met, cling to Him as if your life depended on it. It does! REMEMBER, GOD IS NOT A VENDING MACHINE.
