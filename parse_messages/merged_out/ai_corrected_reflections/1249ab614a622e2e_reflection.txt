Christians are brand-new on the inside. The Holy Spirit gives them new life, and they are not the same anymore. We are not reformed, rehabilitated, or reeducated; we are recreated (new creatures), living in vital union with Christ (Colossians 2:6, 7). At conversion, we do not merely turn over a new leaf; we began a new life under a new Master. Who is your master?
