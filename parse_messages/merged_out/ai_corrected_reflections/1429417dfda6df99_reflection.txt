Should we stay away from unbelievers? No! Although there are some places Christians should avoid. Jesus demonstrated that we must go out among unbelievers to help them. But remember there is a difference between being with unbelievers and being one of them. Being one of them harms our witness for God. Ask yourself about the people you enjoy. "If I am with them often, will I become less obedient to God in outlook or action?" If the answer is yes, carefully monitor how you spend your time with these people and what effect it has on you.
