I came across this saying about Satan, "That he by a tree once overcame, might likewise by a tree be overcome." That tree was the cross on which Jesus defeated the devil. In overcoming Satan, God's Son overcame sin and death. He bore the curse of sin in our place. Through faith in Him as our Savior, we are redeemed and given eternal life. "Without faith, it is impossible to please God." (Hebrews 11:6)
