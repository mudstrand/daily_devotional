Some people think they have earned their way to heaven by living a good and respectful life. But often all they have earned for their efforts is frustration and discouragement. However, because of Christ's sacrifice, the way to God is already open, and we can become His children simply by putting our faith in Him. We no longer need to try to reach God by keeping rules; we can become more and more like Jesus as we live for Him day by day. We need to allow the Holy Spirit to turn our eyes away from our own performance and toward Jesus. He will free us to serve Him out of love and gratitude. This is known as living "in the new way, by the Spirit."
