Sometimes it seems as though God isn't listening to us. The reason could be that when we pray, we may not see how God is working or understand how He will bring any good through it all. So we have to trust Him. We have to relinquish our rights and let God do what is best. We must leave the unknown to the all-knowing One. When we bend our knees to pray, God bends His ear to hear.
