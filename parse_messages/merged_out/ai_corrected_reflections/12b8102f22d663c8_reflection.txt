In spite of the inevitable struggles we will face, remember we are not alone. Jesus does not abandon us in our struggles. Let us also remember that the ultimate victory has already been won, so let us avoid these mistakes: 1. Remorse over yesterday's failure. 2. Anxiety over today's problems. 3. Worry over tomorrow's uncertainty. 4. Procrastination with one's present duty. 5. Resentment of another's success. 6. Criticism of a neighbor's imperfections. 7. Impatience with youth's imperfections. 8. Skepticism of our nation's future. 9. Unbelief in God's providence. Instead, let us claim the peace of Christ in the most troublesome times.
