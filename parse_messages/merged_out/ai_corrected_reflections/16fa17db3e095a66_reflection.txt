Whatever pops up, whether "good" or "bad," we need to pause, praise, and pray. We need to attend to whatever it is without projecting or jumping to conclusions, knowing Jesus goes with us wherever we go. I admit it sometimes feels risky to not immediately brace for the worst, but the peace I've gained through this practice is priceless. Whatever you face today, bring it to Jesus, giving thanks for the Holy Spirit's power to never let you give up.
