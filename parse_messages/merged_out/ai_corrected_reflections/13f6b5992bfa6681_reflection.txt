We cannot begin to imagine all that God has in store for us, both in this life and eternity. He will create a new heaven and a new earth (Isaiah 65:17; Revelation 21:1), and we will live with Him forever. Until then, His Holy Spirit comforts and guides us. Knowing the wonderful and eternal future that awaits us gives us hope and courage to press on in this life, to endure hardship, and to avoid giving in to temptation. This world is not all there is. The best is yet to come.
