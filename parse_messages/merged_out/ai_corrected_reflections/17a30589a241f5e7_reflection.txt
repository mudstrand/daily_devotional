The book of Proverbs tells us about people who have wisdom and enjoy its benefits. The person who has wisdom is loving, is faithful, trusts the Lord, puts God first, turns away from evil, knows right from wrong, listens and learns, and does what is right. The benefits of wisdom are a long, prosperous life, favor with God and people, a reputation for good judgment, success, health, vitality, riches, honor, pleasure, peace, and protection. You must agree, wisdom speaks volumes.
