Some of the Jewish Christians who received this letter may have been on the verge of turning back from their promised rest in Christ, just as the people of Moses' day had turned back from the promised land. In both cases, the difficulties of the present moment overshadowed the reality of God's promise, and the people doubted that God would fulfill His promises. The problem many have today is that they trust in their own efforts instead of Christ's power; then they are in danger of turning back. They will eventually see that their own efforts are never adequate, because only Christ can see us through.
