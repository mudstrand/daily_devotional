The Bible reveals that God intervenes in the affairs of nations (2 Chronicles 7:14). And when God intervenes, He uses ordinary people. It is up to us to do that through prayer. As the psalmist urged the ancient Israelites to pray for the peace and healing of Jerusalem, so we should also pray for the peace and healing of our nations. When we pray in humility, turn from our sins, and seek God, He hears us. Prayer for those in authority is both a privilege and a duty.
