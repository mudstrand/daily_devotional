CORRECTIONS_NEEDED I believe what we should understand here is that Paul's criterion for all his actions was not necessarily what he liked best but what was best for those around him. The opposite approach would be: (1) being sensitive and doing what we want no matter who is hurt by it; (2) being oversensitive and doing nothing, for fear that someone may be displeased; (3) being a "yes person" by going along with everything, trying to gain approval from people rather than God. In this age of "me first" and "looking out for number one," Paul's startling statement is a good standard. If we make the good of others one of our primary goals, we will develop a serving attitude, thus pleasing God.
