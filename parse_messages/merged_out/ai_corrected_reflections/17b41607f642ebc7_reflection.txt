The steps of the godly are directed by the Lord; even though we may stumble, we will not fall. The person in whom the Lord delights is one who follows Him, trusts in Him, and tries to do His will. God watches over and makes firm every step that person takes. If you would like to have God direct your way, then seek His advice before you step out.
