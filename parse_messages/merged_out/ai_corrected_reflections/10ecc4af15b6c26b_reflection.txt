The disciples didn't totally understand the significance of all that had happened until Jesus appeared to them. Jesus' resurrection is the key to the Christian faith. Why? Because (1) Just as He said, Jesus rose from the dead. We can now be confident that He will accomplish all He has promised. (2) Jesus' bodily resurrection shows us that the living Christ, not a false prophet or impostor, is the ruler of God's eternal Kingdom. (3) We can be certain of our own resurrection because Jesus was resurrected. Death is not the end, there is a future life. (4) The divine power that brought Jesus back to life is now available to us to bring our spiritually dead selves back to life. (5) The Resurrection is the basis for the church's witness to the world. When someone comes to you looking for some comforting words in regards to their life after death, first share that Jesus died for the sins of the whole world and it is available to all who believe in His finished work on the cross. Then share the five points above.
