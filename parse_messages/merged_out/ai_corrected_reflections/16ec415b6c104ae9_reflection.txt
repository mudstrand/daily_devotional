In this verse, Jesus sets before us the greatest choice in life. It is up to us to decide today whom we will obey (Joshua 24:15), and God wants us to choose Him and life (Deuteronomy 30:15-20). The wrath of God is God's final judgment and rejection of sinners. To put off the choice is to choose not to follow Christ. Indecision is a fatal decision.
