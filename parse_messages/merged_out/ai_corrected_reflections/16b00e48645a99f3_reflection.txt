As believers in our Lord Jesus Christ, we often feel that God owes us such things as good health, a comfortable life, and material blessings. Of course, God does not owe us anything. Yet He gives us everything. Each day, whether good or bad, is one more gift from our God. Our grateful response should be to live for Him. Our life is a gift from God and should be lived for Him.
