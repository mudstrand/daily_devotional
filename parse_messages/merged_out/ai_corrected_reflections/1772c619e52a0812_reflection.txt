Paul refers to his experience as the start of his new life in Christ (1 Corinthians 9:1; 15:18; Galatians 1:15, 16). At the center of this wonderful experience was Jesus Christ. Paul did not see a vision; he saw the risen Christ Himself (9:17). Paul acknowledged Jesus as Lord, confessed his own sin, surrendered his life to Christ, and resolved to obey Him. True conversion comes from a personal encounter with Jesus Christ and leads to a new life in a relationship with Him.
