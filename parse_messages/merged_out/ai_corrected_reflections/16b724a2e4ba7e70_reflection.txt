A spiritual slump can make us feel forsaken by God. We struggle with troubling thoughts. Our hearts become sorrowful. We're sure that we're fighting a losing battle. Are you in a slump? Plead with God, trust Him, and praise His name. Then get back in the game. Feed your faith and your doubts will starve to death.
