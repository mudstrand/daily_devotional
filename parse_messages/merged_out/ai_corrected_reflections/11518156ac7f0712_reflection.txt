The "law at work within" is the sin nature deep within us. This is our vulnerability to sin; it refers to everything within us that is more loyal to our old way of selfish living than to God. This inward struggle with sin was as real to Paul as it is to us. We can learn what to do about it from Paul. Whenever Paul felt lost, he returned to the beginning of his spiritual life, remembering that he had already been freed by Jesus Christ. When we feel confused and overwhelmed by sin's appeal, we need to follow Paul's example: Thank God that He has given us freedom through Jesus Christ. We need to let the reality of Christ's power to lift us up to real victory over sin.
