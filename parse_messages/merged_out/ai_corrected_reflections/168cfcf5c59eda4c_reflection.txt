Surely God puts people into our lives to give us help and comfort. But let's also remember to pray. God will hear us. David sang "From His temple he heard my voice; my cry came before, into His ears." Our faith should be like David's "He is our rock, our fortress, and our deliverer." Prayer is the bridge between panic and peace.
