These words were intended to break down the false security held by the Jews. Paul presented to them the information of a righteous and holy God whose judgment is just. Contrasting to God's holiness, he presented the hypocrisy and ungodliness which was theirs. As responsible people of God, he explains their advantages: 1) They bear the name of God's chosen people; 2) They possess God's written law; 3) The true God has been revealed to them; and 4) They have knowledge of God's will. They had been entrusted with the written law of God and had sufficient knowledge to distinguish between good and evil. However, Paul does not count them so well qualified, and rendered a crushing blow to their supposed pride by questioning their fitness to lead the blind.
