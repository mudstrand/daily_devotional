Have you ever wondered how Jesus was made perfect through suffering? Well, the suffering that Jesus accepted on our behalf made Him a perfect leader or pioneer of our salvation. Jesus Himself did not need to suffer for His own salvation, because He was God in human form. His perfect obedience (which led Him down the road of suffering) demonstrates that He was the complete sacrifice for us. Through suffering, Jesus completed the work necessary for our own salvation. Our suffering can make us more sensitive servants of God. People who have known pain are able to reach out with compassion to others who hurt. If you have suffered, ask God how your experience can be used to help others.
