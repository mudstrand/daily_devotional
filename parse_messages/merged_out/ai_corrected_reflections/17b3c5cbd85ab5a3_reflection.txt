Some people have a little inner voice that sometimes whispers, "My way is best." This has been known to be pride. Too much pride has a way of resisting God's leadership and believing that he or she is able to live without God's help. If you find yourself wanting to do it your way or looking down on other people, you are being controlled by pride. Only when you eliminate pride can God help you become all that He meant you to be.
