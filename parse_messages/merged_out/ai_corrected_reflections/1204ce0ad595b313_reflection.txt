The more you read the Psalms, the more you will realize that this book was written to help us worship God. We should realize that out of the 66 books of the Bible, the book of Psalms was given especially for this purpose. The other books were given as historical, or doctrinal, or practical. But the Psalms take us into the inner sanctuary of God's holy presence to enjoy the blessedness of fellowship with Him. It is a book of devotions inspired by the Holy Spirit.
