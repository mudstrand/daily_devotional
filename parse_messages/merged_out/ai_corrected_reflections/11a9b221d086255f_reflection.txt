Not only did Paul face beatings and dangers, he also carried the daily concern for the young churches. He worried whether they would stay true to the Good News and free from false teachings and inner strife. Paul was concerned for individuals in the churches he had served. If God has placed you in a position of leadership and authority, treat people with Paul's kind of empathy and concern.
