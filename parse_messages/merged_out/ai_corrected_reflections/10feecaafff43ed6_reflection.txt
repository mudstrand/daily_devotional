In the Old Testament, the high priest was the mediator between God and His people. His job was to regularly offer animal sacrifices according to the law and to intercede with God for forgiveness for the people's sins. Jesus Christ is now our high priest. He came to earth as a human being; so, He understands our weaknesses and shows mercy to us. He has once and for all paid the penalty for our sins by His own sacrificial death (atonement), and He can be depended on to restore our broken relationship with God. We are released from sin's domination over us when we commit ourselves fully to Christ, trusting completely in what He has done for us.
