God wants us to identify with the needy, not ignore them. The second part of this proverb could be restated positively: "Those who open their eyes to the poor people will be blessed."

Paul promises that God will supply all our needs (Philippians 4:19); He usually does this through other people. What can you do today to help God supply someone's needs?
