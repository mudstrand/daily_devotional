This is a thought that may come to our minds too. Yes, living for God in a deceitful world can be a difficult and lonely battle. At one time, the great prophet Elijah felt so lonely he wanted to die. But God told him that there were 7,000 other faithful servants (1 Kg. 19:4, 14, 18). Let us remember we are never alone in our battle against evil—when you feel alone, seek out other believers for strength and support.
