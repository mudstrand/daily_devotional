These verses contain one of the most comforting promises in all the Scriptures. Believers have always needed to face hardships in many forms: persecution, illness, imprisonment, and yes, even death. But of course, this sometimes causes believers to think they have been abandoned by Christ. But Paul says: "This is impossible." He says it is impossible to be separated from Christ. How can we be sure of this? Christ's death for us is proof of His unconquerable love. Nothing can separate us from Christ's presence. God tells us how great His love is so that we will feel totally secure in Him. If we believe these overwhelming assurances, we will not be afraid.
