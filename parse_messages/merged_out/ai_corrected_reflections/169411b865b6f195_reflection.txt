When life has you down—whether through sorrow that seems too hard to bear or circumstances that make each day a morning-to-night grind—my friend's advice can help. But first, let God pull you up by His power (Psalm 54:1-4). Then, hold on to His hand. Trust His power and hold on. HE WILL GIVE YOU THE STRENGTH TO KEEP FROM FALLING. (ISA. 40:31)
