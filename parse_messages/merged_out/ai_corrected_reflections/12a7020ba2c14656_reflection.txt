Are you always fully prepared to allow God to grip you by His power and allow Him to do a work in you that is truly worthy of Himself? Sanctification is not our idea of what He wants to do in us. But He has to get us into the state of mind and spirit where we will allow Him to sanctify us completely, whatever the cost. (see 1 Thessalonians 5:23, 24)
