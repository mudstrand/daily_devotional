Our ultimate hope when we are experiencing a terrible illness, persecution, or pain is the realization that this life is not all there is. Let us remember there is life after death! Having the assurance that we will live forever with God in a place without sin and suffering can help us live above the pain we face in this life. Let us pray that we will be joined by all our family members in that place.
