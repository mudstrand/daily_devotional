Verse 12 seems like a tall order in our troubled world today: "Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction." But the next three words hold the answer to how this is possible: "Be faithful in prayer." Yes, we can take our problems to the Lord. But there is one important lesson we need to learn; we need to learn to leave them there. How often have we taken a certain problem to God, but then have picked it up again and taken it with us? The Bible says: "Cast all your cares upon Him [God]; for He careth for you." Are you among the people who believe in the latter part of this verse but never do the first? Whatever your problem, it is not too big for God to handle.
