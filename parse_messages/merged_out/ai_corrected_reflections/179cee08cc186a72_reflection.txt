I think we all know that the farmer cannot rush the growth of his crops. But he does not take the summer off. There is a lot of work to do to ensure a good crop. In the same way, we must wait patiently for Christ's return. We cannot make Him come back any sooner. But while we wait, there is much work that we can do to advance God's Kingdom. Both the Christian and the farmer must look toward the future reward for their labors.
