The power of music to heal and help is a gift from God that comforts many. Perhaps that is why the Psalmist speaks so deeply to us. There we find lyrics that connect with our hearts, allowing us to speak to God from the depth of our hearts. May our God give us a song today that will remind us of His greatness, no matter what we may face.
