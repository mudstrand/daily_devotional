Because of Christ's death and resurrection, His followers need never fear death. That assurance frees us to enjoy fellowship with Him and to do His will. This will affect all our activities: work and worship, play, Bible study, quiet times, and times of caring for others. When you know that you do not have to fear death, you will experience a new zest for life.
