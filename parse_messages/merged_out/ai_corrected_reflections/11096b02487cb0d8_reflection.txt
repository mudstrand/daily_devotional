What Paul was saying here is that these Jewish Christians were immature. Paul says that by this time they should have been teaching others, but they had not applied the basics to their own lives. They were reluctant to move beyond their old traditions, their established doctrines, and discussions of the basics. Paul is saying they would not be able to understand the high-priestly role of Christ unless they moved out of their comfort zone. They would have to cut some of their Jewish ties and stop trying to blend in with their culture. If we are truly committed to Christ, He will move us out of our comfort zone.
