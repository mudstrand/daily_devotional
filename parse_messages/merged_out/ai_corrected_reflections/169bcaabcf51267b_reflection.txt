We need to remember that we were fashioned from dust in the hands of our Creator, and led like sheep into green pastures (vs. 5). We, His people, have a loving Savior. What a picture we have of a good, loving, and faithful God we have. No wonder it will take forever to enjoy His greatness. Let us thank God for life, for joy, for protection, and for promising us a future with Him forever.
