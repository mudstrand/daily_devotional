At the end of our life, it will be too late to ask for advice. When desire is fully activated, people don't want advice, they want satisfaction. The best time to learn the dangers of foolishness, of going after forbidden sex (or anything else that is harmful) is long before temptation comes. Resistance is easier if the decision has already been made. Don't wait to see what happens. Prepare for temptation by deciding now how you will act when you face it.
