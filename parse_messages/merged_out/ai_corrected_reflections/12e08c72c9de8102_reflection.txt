"Love your enemies" ~ What Jesus commands is not about emotions but as loving actions. Remember when Jesus Himself was stripped, beaten, and blasphemed by the soldiers, scribes, Pharisees, officers, and priests. Not even then did He pronounce any maliciousness against them. Do you remember what He did and said? He prayed, saying: "Father, forgive them."
