Here is the corrected text:

Here is what we are to glean from this: In this passage, Paul shows how the Jews and the Gentiles benefit from each other. Whenever God shows mercy to one group, the other shares the blessing. In God's original plan, the Jews would be the source of God's blessing to the Gentiles (Genesis 12:3). When the Jews neglected this mission, God blessed the Gentiles anyway through the Jewish Messiah. He still maintained His love for the Jews because of His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But someday, all faithful Jews will share in God's mercy. God's plan will not be thwarted: He will have mercy on everyone.
