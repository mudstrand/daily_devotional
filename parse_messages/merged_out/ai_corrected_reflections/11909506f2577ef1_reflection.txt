Because Christ rose from the dead, He is a life-giving spirit. This means that He entered into a new form of existence. He is the source of the spiritual life that will result in our resurrection. Christ's new glorified human body now suits His new glorified life, just as Adam's human body was suitable to his natural life. When we are resurrected, God will give us transformed, eternal bodies suited to our new eternal life.
