When you read the words "on your heart," it means you should always remember and let them be inwardly treasured. "Teach them diligently" is a reminder that parents are to teach God's Word faithfully and repeatedly to their children so that God will continually dwell with His people. We are also reminded that we have numerous opportunities to talk with our children about what God has done. As Christians, we should take every opportunity to discuss what God has done through Christ, no matter where we are or what we are doing.
