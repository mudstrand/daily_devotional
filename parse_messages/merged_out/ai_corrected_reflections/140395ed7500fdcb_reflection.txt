David was not sitting on his throne in a place of power, but he was running for his life from his rebellious son, Absalom, and a group of traitors. When circumstances go against us, it is tempting to think that God is also against us. But David reminds us that the opposite is true. When everything seems to go against us, God is still for us. So if circumstances have turned against you, don't blame God—seek Him.
