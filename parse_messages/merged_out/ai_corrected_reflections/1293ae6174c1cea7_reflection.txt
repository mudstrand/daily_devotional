Have you ever thought that because you aren't good enough for God, He will not save you? Do you ever feel as if salvation is for everyone else but you? Then this verse is especially for you. If God gave His Son for you, He isn't going to hold back the gift of salvation. If Christ gave His life for you, He isn't going to turn around and condemn you! He will not withhold anything you need to live for Him. The book of Romans is more than a theological explanation of God's redeeming grace; it is a letter of comfort and confidence addressed to you.
