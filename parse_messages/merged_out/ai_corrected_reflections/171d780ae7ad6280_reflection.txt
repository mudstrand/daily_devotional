No one is beyond His reach. Every person who has accepted the Lord's salvation needs to be interceding for a person's salvation. When we are together with a loved one, we should draw the Lord's name into the conversation. Will the Lord grant this person eternal life? There is no way to know. Jesus alone decides who, what, why, and when of each soul's destiny. Each of us needs to be willing to step aside as He leads, waiting and watching, in hope and faith.
