A few days ago, someone questioned a remark I made about the work of the Holy Spirit. I think this will answer your question. What verse 6 is saying is that humans cannot turn up their noses at God and expect to get by with it. That is what is meant by "God cannot be mocked." The immutable law built into creation, illustrated by sowing and reaping, is really saying that our actions have consequences. Those who "Sow to the Holy Spirit" are living under the Holy Spirit's power and direction and "will reap eternal life."
