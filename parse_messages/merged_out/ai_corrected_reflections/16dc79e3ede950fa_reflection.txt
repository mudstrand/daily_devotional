There is much more to the question that is asked in Matthew 6:31. If Jesus would not have come as our Savior, we would have asked, "What shall we wear?" with regard to the spiritual clothes we need as we stand before God on the Last Day and every day. Thank God we know His answer to the question, "for He has clothed me in garments of salvation and arrayed me in a robe of righteousness" (Isaiah 61:10). The Gospel bids us to trust in the atoning merit of Jesus Christ and be clothed in the robes of righteousness.
