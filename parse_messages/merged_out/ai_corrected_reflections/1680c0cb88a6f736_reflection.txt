One of the functions of angels is to watch over believers. (Hebrews 1:14) There are many examples of guardian angels throughout Scriptures, (1 Kings 19 -- Daniel 6 -- Matthew 18 -- Luke 16 -- Acts 12) Angels can also be God's messengers (Matthew 2 -- Acts 27:23, 24). I believe it is very comforting to know that God watches over us in times of great stress and fear. With this fact, we should realize we always have God's attention.
