Let's quit dwelling on the faults of others. The church needs builders and workers—not a wrecking crew. Let's work on our own faults, then seek to help others in a spirit of gentleness. Remember, it is easy to make a mountain out of a molehill; all we need to do is add a little dirt. prayer: Lord, tame my tongue and humble my heart so I don't magnify others' faults. Build in me a gentle spirit that works on my own weaknesses first and restores others with compassion. Make me a builder in Your church, not part of a wrecking crew.
