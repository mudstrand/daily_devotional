Christ's Word on Holy Baptism is backed by His sin-atoning work. "Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God" (1 Peter 3:18). By virtue of His all-sufficient atonement, as verified by His resurrection, Baptism saves because it creates and confirms faith in the merit of Jesus Christ as Savior. Let me say: The water of Baptism cleans up the messes that floods of sin create.
