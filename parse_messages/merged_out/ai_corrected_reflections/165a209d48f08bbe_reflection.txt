Works and troubles do not merit justification, but other payments. The fulfilling of the law earns a reward, for a reward properly relates to the law. Yet we should be mindful of the Gospel, which freely offers justification for Christ's sake. We neither obey the Law, nor can we keep it, nor can we obey it, before we have been reconciled to God, justified, and reborn. Nor would the fulfilling of the Law please God. We are accepted by faith.
