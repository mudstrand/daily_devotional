God used many approaches to send His message to people in the OT times. He spoke to Isaiah in visions (Isaiah 6), to Jacob in a dream (Genesis 28:10-22), and to Abraham and Moses personally (Genesis 18; Exodus 31:18). Jewish people familiar with these stories would not have found it hard to believe that God was still revealing His will, but it was astonishing for them to think that God had revealed Himself by speaking through His Son, Jesus Christ. Jesus is the fulfillment and culmination of God's revelation through the centuries. When we know Him, we have all we need to be saved from our sin and to have a perfect relationship with God.
