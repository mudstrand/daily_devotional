The poor should be glad because riches mean nothing to God; otherwise, these people would be considered unworthy. The rich should be glad that money means nothing to God because money is easily lost. We find our true wealth by developing our spiritual life, not by developing our financial assets. God is interested in what is lasting (our soul), not in what is temporary (our money and possessions). Read (Mark 4:18-19) for Jesus' words on this subject.
