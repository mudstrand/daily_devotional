When sacrificing an animal according to God's law, a priest would kill the animal, cut it in pieces, and place it on the altar. Sacrifice was important, but even in the Old Testament, God made it clear that obedience from the heart was much more important. God wants us to offer ourselves, not animals, as living sacrifices, daily laying aside our own desires to follow Him, putting our energy and resources at His disposal and trusting Him to guide us. We are to do this out of gratitude that our sins have been forgiven.
