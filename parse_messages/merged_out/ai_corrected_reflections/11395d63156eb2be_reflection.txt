What we should be aware of is that there are three groups of rebellious persons mentioned here. 1) Those who are factious, causing divisions by their insistence that their way is the only way. 2) Those who are disobedient to the truth; this includes all manner of waywardness, lethargy, and rebellion against God; and 3) Those who obey unrighteousness, consenting to evil works, for they sin deliberately. Now remember our "food for thought?" Everyone has a responsibility before God for wrongdoing in whatever degree. But we also need to remember that one having the advantages of a Christian home, possessing the light of the Gospel, will be held more highly responsible before God than the one having less advantage in Christian nurture and less opportunity to know the will of God.
