God alone is worthy of being worshipped. What is your attitude toward worship? Do you willingly and joyfully come into God's presence, or are you just going through the motions, reluctantly going to church? This Psalm tells us to remember God's goodness and dependability, and then to worship with thanksgiving and praise.
