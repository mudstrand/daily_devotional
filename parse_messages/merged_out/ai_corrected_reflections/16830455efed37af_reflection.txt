We don't receive spiritual blessings because we're strong; we get them (the secret is) because we believe in Jesus. These blessings come only through God's undeserved grace. The penalty of sin and its power over us were miraculously destroyed by Christ on the cross. Through faith in Christ, we stand acquitted, or not guilty before God.
