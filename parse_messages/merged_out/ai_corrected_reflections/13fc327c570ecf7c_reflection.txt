Yes, it is Jesus Christ who saves His people from their sins, who rules over a people willing in the day of His power and proves in them that He enables them to say, "I delight to do Thy will, O my God," who says, "Lo, I am with you always." The abiding presence of the Savior from sin is promised to all who have accepted Him in the fullness of His redeeming power and who preach by their lives as well as by their words what a wonderful Savior He is.
