Have you ever felt far from God, separated by feelings of failure and personal problems? Remember, God stands ready to hear His people, to forgive their sins, and restore their relationship with Him. God is waiting and listening for our confession of guilt and our recommitment to obey Him. He hears us when we pour out our needs and problems to Him and is ready to forgive us and restore us to fellowship with Him. Don't wait to experience His loving forgiveness.
