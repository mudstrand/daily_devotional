God says wisdom is primary and fundamental. It is the foundation on which all life is built. Paul and John in the N.T. alluded to Solomon's statements about wisdom to describe Christ's presence at the creation of the world. (John 17:5, 24) Let us always seek first God's Kingdom and His righteousness, and this wisdom will be added unto us.
