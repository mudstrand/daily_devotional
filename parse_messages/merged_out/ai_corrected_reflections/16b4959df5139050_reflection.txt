Do you ever wake up in the morning to discover feelings of dread clouding your mind? Some mornings we do wake up to a very difficult day. When this happens, we can either give in to despair or follow the example of David. Faith, gratitude, and expectation will enable us to face the most trying day with strong confidence in God. Remember, that every day is a good day when you are in God's word.
