The complaining we often hear is: "There is nothing new under the sun!" Let's not be negative today and focus on what God's Word says for today: "God seeks for what has been driven away." The one searching for meaning in life should read this verse again. To avoid a meaningless life, one needs to seek a closer relationship with God. Justification based on God's favor toward us is on account of Christ and received through faith in Him.
