In this lifetime, it may not be possible to adequately seek the depths of the book of Psalms. Yet we need to start digging. The Psalms teach us to pray, encourage us to trust, and invite us to dine at the table of God's endless goodness. Starting this week, I want to take us through the Psalms, one verse of each chapter, day by day.
