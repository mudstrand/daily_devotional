The true atheist is either foolish or wicked—foolish because he ignores that God exists, or wicked because he refuses to live by God's truths. The truth of the matter is, we all become atheists in practice when we rely more on ourselves than on God. The fool mentioned here is someone who is aggressively perverse in his actions. To speak in direct defiance of God is utterly foolish, according to the Bible.
