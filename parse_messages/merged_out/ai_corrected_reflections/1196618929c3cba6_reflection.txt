Paul explains that it was time to forgive the man who had been punished by the church and had evidently repented. Now he needed forgiveness, acceptance, and comfort. Satan would gain an advantage if they permanently separated this man from the congregation rather than forgiving and restoring him. Church discipline should seek restoration. There are two mistakes the church often makes: being too lenient and not correcting mistakes, or being too harsh and not forgiving the sinner. There is a time to confront and a time to comfort.
