Jesus was "born of a woman," He was human. He was born a Jew. He was subject to God's law. He fulfilled it perfectly. Thus, Jesus was a perfect sacrifice because, although He was fully human, He never sinned. His death brought freedom for us who were enslaved to sin so that we could be adopted into God's family. If Christ had not come, there would not be a Christian in the world. Imagine that!
