God called the universe into existence out of nothing; He declared that it was to be, and it was. Our faith is to be in the God who created the entire universe by His word. God's word has awesome power. When He speaks, do you listen and respond? How can you better prepare yourself to respond to God's word? We need to continually pray for sensitive hearts.
