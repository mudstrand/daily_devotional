It is an awesome privilege to be able to approach God with freedom and confidence. Most of us would be apprehensive in the presence of a powerful ruler. But thanks to Christ, by faith we can enter directly into God's presence through prayer. We can have the assurance that we will be welcomed with open arms because we are God's children through our union with Christ. Don't be afraid of God. Talk to Him about everything. He is waiting to hear from you.
