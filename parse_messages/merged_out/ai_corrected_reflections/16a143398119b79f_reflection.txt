Our choices are truly revealing. Of course, God doesn't need to wait to see our choices in order for Him to know what's in our hearts. Yes, the things that occupy our time and attention are telling. Regardless of what we want Him to think of us, the true condition of our heart becomes clear based on how we use our time, money, and talents. When we invest these things in things He cares about, then it reveals that our hearts are in tune with His.
