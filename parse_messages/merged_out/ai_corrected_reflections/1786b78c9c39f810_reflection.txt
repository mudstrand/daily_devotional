Our Lord Jesus used water for spiritual healing when He instituted the Sacrament of Baptism. The Word and the waters of Baptism heal spiritually because the Holy Spirit works through them. It causes a sinner, even a very young one, to come to saving faith. In Baptism, the water and the Word flow like a refreshing, healing spring, bringing with them all that our Savior earned for us on the cross: forgiveness of sins, life, salvation, and spiritual renewal.
