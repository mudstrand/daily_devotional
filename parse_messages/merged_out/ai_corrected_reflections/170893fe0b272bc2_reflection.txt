The great cloud of witnesses are the people of faith described in chapter 11. Their faithfulness should be an encouragement to us. We do not struggle alone, and we are not the first to struggle with problems we face. Others have run the race and won, and their witness should stir us to run and win. The Christian life involves hard work. It requires us to give up whatever endangers our relationship with God, so let us keep our eyes on Jesus. We should be running for Him, not ourselves.
