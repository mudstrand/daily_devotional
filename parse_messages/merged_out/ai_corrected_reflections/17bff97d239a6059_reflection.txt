Does that mean we should never borrow? No, but it warns us never to take on a loan without carefully examining our ability to repay it. A loan we can handle is enabling; a loan we cannot handle is enslaving. The borrower must realize that until the loan is repaid, he is a servant to the individual or institution that made it.
