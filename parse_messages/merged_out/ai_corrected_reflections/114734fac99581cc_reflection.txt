We need to take note here that all three members of the Trinity are involved in salvation. The Father loved us so much that He sent His Son to bridge the gap between us (John 3:16). The Father and the Son send the Holy Spirit to fill our lives with love and to enable us to live by His power (Acts 1:8). With all this loving care, how can we do less than serve Him completely?
