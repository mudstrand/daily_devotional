It is true that Jesus is with us through, but are we going on with Him? Many of us turn back from going on with Jesus the very moment we have an experience of what He can do. Watch when God changes your circumstances to see whether you are going on with Jesus, or siding with the world, the flesh, and the devil. We wear His name, but are we going on with Him? "From that time many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more." (John 6:66) Are you going on with Jesus? His voice is still calling, "Follow Me." (Matthew 4:19)
