Jesus says that our Christ-like love will show we are His disciples. Do people see petty bickering, jealousy, and division in your church? Do they know you are Jesus' followers? Or do they know you are Jesus' followers by your love for one another? Let us remember love is more than simply warm feelings; it is an attitude that reveals itself in actions.
