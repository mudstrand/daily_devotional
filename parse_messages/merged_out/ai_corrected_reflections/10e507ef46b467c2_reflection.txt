Jesus had been teaching, preaching, and healing. These were the three main aspects of His ministry. Teaching showed Jesus' concern for understanding; preaching showed His concern for commitment; and healing showed His concern for wholeness. His miracles of healing authenticated His teaching and preaching, proving He was from God. Jesus is the authentic Christ—the Savior of the world. Everything He accomplished proved Him to be all that the Bible says He is.
