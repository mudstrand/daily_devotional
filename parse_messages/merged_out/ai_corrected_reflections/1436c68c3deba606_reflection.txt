Because the wicked have no fear of God, nothing restrains them from sinning. They charge ahead as if nothing will happen to them. But God is just and is only delaying their punishment. This knowledge should hold us back from sinning. Let the fear of God do its work in you to keep you from sin. If you have any gratitude for God's love, don't ignore His justice.
