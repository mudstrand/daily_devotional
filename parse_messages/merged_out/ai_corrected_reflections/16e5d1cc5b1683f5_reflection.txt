Paul was sent to the Greeks and barbarians, to the wise and the foolish. Today, we may be tempted to keep the Gospel to ourselves or limit it to people like us. But Jesus did not limit His work. He redeemed the whole world—even barbarians and fools like us. He has commissioned us to reach out to all people. So let us remember to thank our Heavenly Father for trusting us to be His witnesses.
