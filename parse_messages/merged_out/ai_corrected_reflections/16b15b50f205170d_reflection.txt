Prayer is our approach to God, and we are to come "boldly." Some Christians approach God meekly with heads hung low, afraid to ask Him to meet their needs. Others pray flippantly, giving little thought to what they say. Come with reverence because He is your King. But also come with bold assurance because He is your friend and counselor. When life knocks you down, you are in a perfect position to pray.
