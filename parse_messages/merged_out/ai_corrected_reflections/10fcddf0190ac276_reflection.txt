"God testified to the message of salvation," this is a continuation of vs. 3. Those who had heard Jesus speak and then had passed on His words also had the truth of their words confirmed by "signs and wonders and various miracles and by giving gifts of the Holy Spirit." In the book of Acts, miracles and gifts of the Spirit authenticated the Good News wherever it was preached (see Acts 9:31ff; 14:1ff). Paul, who discussed spiritual gifts in Romans 12, I Corinthians 12-14, and Ephesians 4, taught that their purpose is to build up the church, making it strong and mature. When this is fulfilled, we know that God is truly present. As we receive God's gifts, we should thank Him for them and put them to use in the church.
