"The wicked" are people who try to make their own way in the world either as a law to themselves (Psalm 31:18) or by relying on false gods (Jeremiah 13:9-10). "fallen-thrown down." Success and prosperity of the ungodly are fleeting. This Psalm ends with the nature and ultimate destiny of wickedness. God has already overthrown all evil and wickedness through His Son, our Savior.
