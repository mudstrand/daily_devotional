This "fullness" is fully expressed in Christ (Colossians 2:9-10). In union with Christ and through His empowering Spirit, we are complete. We have all the fullness of God available to us. But we must appropriate that fullness through faith and through prayer as we daily live for Him. Paul's prayer for the Ephesians, and also for us, is let us ask the Holy Spirit to fill every aspect of our life to the fullest.
