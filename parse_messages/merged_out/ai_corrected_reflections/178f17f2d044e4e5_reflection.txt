Sometimes this change is very dramatic, a great miracle of divine grace. For many, however, spiritual birth is not as dramatic but is, nevertheless, miraculous. Baptized in infancy and given Christian instruction as they grew, they have believed in Jesus Christ as their sole Savior all along, loving and serving Him in response. That was the experience of Timothy, St. Paul's coworker, to whom the apostle wrote, "From infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus" (2 Timothy 3:15).
