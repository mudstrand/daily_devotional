In an increasingly chaotic world, what a hopeful thought that this could be the year that Jesus returns. More comforting still is the anticipation that all who trust Him for salvation will be gathered together, relieved from this world's suffering, sorrow, and fear. Best of all, we'll be with the Lord forever. New Year's resolution: share faith, offer prayer, gather hope.
