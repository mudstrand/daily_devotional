Sin may try to entice us by tempting us with a new experience, convincing us that right doesn't matter, or appealing to our physical senses. However, there is a way for us to rule over sin instead of letting it consume our lives. The Bible says, "Walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh." (Galatians 5:16). When we face temptation, we don't face it alone. We face it with supernatural assistance. Relying on God's Spirit supplies the power to live for Him and others.
