True love is as strong as death; it cannot be killed by time or disaster, and it cannot be bought for any price because it is freely given. Love is priceless, and the richest king cannot buy it. Love must be accepted as a gift from God and then shared within the guidelines God provides. Accept the love of your spouse as God's gift, and strive to make your love a reflection of the perfect love that comes from God.
