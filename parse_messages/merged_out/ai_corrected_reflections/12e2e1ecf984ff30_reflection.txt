The thing to remember here is, we are not saved by our love for God but by the love of God for us in sending Christ to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins. Luther once said, "Provide yourselves with armor from Scripture concerning justification which takes place through faith. If you put your reliance on these passages, you will be able to stand even after a fall."
