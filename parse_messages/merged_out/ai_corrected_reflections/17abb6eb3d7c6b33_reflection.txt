You have not mastered self-control if you do not control what you say. Words can cut and destroy. James recognized this truth when he said, "The tongue is a small thing, but what enormous damage it can do" (James 3:5). If you want to be self-controlled, begin with your tongue. Stop and think before you react or speak. If you can control this small but powerful member, you can control the rest of the body.
