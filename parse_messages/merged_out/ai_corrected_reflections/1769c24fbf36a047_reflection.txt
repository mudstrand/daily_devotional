The psalmist sings out his praises to God, overwhelmed by all that God has done. As we reflect on God's majesty and His goodness to us, we cannot help telling others about Him. Witnessing comes naturally when our hearts are full of appreciation for what He has done. God has chosen to use us to "publish His glorious deeds among the nations." Praise for our great God overflows from His creation and should overflow from our lips. How well are you doing at telling others about God's greatness?
