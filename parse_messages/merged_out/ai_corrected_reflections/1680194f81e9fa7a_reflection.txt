We need to keep this verse as a reminder: "Now is the day of salvation." Why? Have you asked Jesus into your heart? Do you have the assurance that you will have another day? Has the Holy Spirit alerted you to your need to put your trust in Jesus? Don't put it off! Run to Jesus. The Apostle Paul reminds us: "Now is the day!" Remember, there's no better day than today to enter into God's family! Have a happy and blessed new year in the Lord's favor!
