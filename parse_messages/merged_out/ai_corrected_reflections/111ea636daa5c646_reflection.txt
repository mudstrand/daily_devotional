Sin always blocks our vision of God; so if we want to see God, we must renounce sin and obey Him. Holiness is coupled with living in peace. A right relationship with God leads to a right relationship with fellow believers. Although we will not always feel loving toward other believers, we must pursue peace as we become more Christ-like.
