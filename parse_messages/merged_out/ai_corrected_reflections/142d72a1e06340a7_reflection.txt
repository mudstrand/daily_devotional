David called upon God to deliver him. He wanted God to stop those who were unjustly causing trouble. David made his request based upon what he knew of God's name or character. In times like these, God alone is our comfort and strength. Even when we are too weak to fight, we can lean on Him. Often, it is when we recognize our weakness that God's greatest strength becomes available.
