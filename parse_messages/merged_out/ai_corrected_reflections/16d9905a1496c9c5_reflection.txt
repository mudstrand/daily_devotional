The quiet procedure of Jesus is so different from the publicity-seeking actions of many would-be reformers and crusaders. Matthew records the Messianic prophecy of Isaiah, "He will not quarrel or cry out; no one will hear His voice in the streets . . . till He leads justice to victory" (Matthew 12:19-20). The Messiah is presented as the Servant who, without self-promotion and fanfare, quickly, gently, and tenderly did His work of healing the sick and nurturing faith. Are we like that?
