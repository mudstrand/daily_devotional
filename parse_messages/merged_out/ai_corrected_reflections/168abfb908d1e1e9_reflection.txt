Sometimes it doesn't take much to get us down, does it? Oh yes, life can seem unbearable at times. But don't let circumstances keep you down. Meditate on God's goodness to you, and talk to Him. Knowing that He loves and "accepts [your] prayer" (Psalm 6:9) will give you strength to help you get up when you're down. When things are looking down, try looking up!
