What Paul is saying is that our wickedness does not invalidate the faithfulness of God. But instead, it confirms it. But there is a danger in the interpretation that is sometimes offered, and that is that our unrighteousness is good since it can be used to throw greater light on God's truth and faithfulness. Such interpretation suggests that the more of sin the better, since the sinner can be the recipient then of greater grace and compassion. But this is a false belief, and a total perversion of Paul's words. And in verse six, we will see his disapproval of this thought.
