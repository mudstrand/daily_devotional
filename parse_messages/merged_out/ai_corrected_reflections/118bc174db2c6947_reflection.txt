Everything done in a worship service must be beneficial to the worshipers. This principle touches every aspect—singing, preaching, and the exercise of spiritual gifts. Those who are contributing to the services, such as singers, speakers, and readers, must have love as their chief motivation, speaking useful words or participating in a way that will strengthen the faith of other believers.
