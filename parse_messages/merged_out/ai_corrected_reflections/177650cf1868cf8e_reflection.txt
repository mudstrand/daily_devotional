Let us remember that there is a beauty in God's people, in that they serve with the variety of gifts given to them by the Holy Spirit. Paul mentioned some: "To one there is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, to another the message of knowledge, to another faith, to another the gifts of healing" (1 Corinthians 12:8) and so on. The Holy Spirit has one purpose in distributing the spiritual gifts in so great a variety, and that is that Christians not only profess but also proclaim that "Jesus is Lord" (1 Corinthians 12:3). What a privilege!
