All of God's promises of what the Messiah would be like are fulfilled in Christ ("He is the divine Yes"). Jesus was completely faithful in His ministry; He never sinned (1 Peter 3:18). He faithfully died for us (Hebrews 2:9); and now He faithfully intercedes for us (Romans 8:34; Hebrews 4:14). Because Jesus Christ is faithful, Paul wanted to be faithful in his ministry. Christ's example should also be our directive, our guiding light.
