Now because of their desire to serve Christ, some people in the Corinthian church thought they ought to divorce their pagan spouses and marry Christians. But we see in these verses that Paul affirms the marriage commitment. God's ideal is for husbands and wives to stay together — even when one spouse is not a believer. The Christian spouse should try to win the other to Christ. Yes, it would be easy to rationalize leaving, but Paul makes a strong case for staying with the unbelieving spouse and being a positive influence on the marriage. Paul, like Jesus, believed that marriage is permanent (see Mark 10:1-9).
