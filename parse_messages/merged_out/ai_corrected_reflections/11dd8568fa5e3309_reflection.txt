We need to remember that we can bring sorrow to the Holy Spirit by the way we live. Paul warns against unwholesome language, bitterness, improper use of anger, harsh words, slander, and bad attitudes toward others. Instead of acting that way, we should be forgiving, just as God has forgiven us. Are you bringing sorrow or pleasing God with your attitude and actions? Let us act in love toward our brothers and sisters in Christ, just as God acted in love by sending His Son to die for our sins.
