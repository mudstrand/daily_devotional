Like the discomfort of the shots the nurse gave me before the doctor began to remove my cancer, the discomfort of God's anger is just for a moment, but the good effects go on for a long time. Let God's anger be a sharp pain that warns you to turn from sin. When we are called home to heaven, by God's grace we will be ready to go.
