In contrast to evil people and their wicked plots that end in failure, God is faithful, righteous, and just. His love is as vast as the heavens—His faithfulness reaches beyond the clouds—His righteousness is as solid as the mountains—and His judgments are as full of wisdom as the oceans are with water. We need not fear evil people because we know God loves us, judges evil, and will care for us throughout eternity.
