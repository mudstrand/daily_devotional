Pride is our inner voice that whispers, "My way is best." It is resisting God's leadership and believing that you are able to live without His help. Whenever you find yourself wanting to do it your way or looking down on other people, you are being controlled by pride. Only when you eliminate pride can God help you become all that you were meant to be.
