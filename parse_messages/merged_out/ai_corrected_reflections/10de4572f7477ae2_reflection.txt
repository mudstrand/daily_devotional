The greatest sin we can commit is to reject Christ. When Jesus says "they have no excuse," He is referring to the work of the cross. When we think about His sacrifice for us, rejecting Him is unforgivable. Jesus' teaching, preaching, and miracles all plainly reveal who He was, but yet much of the world rejects Him and also hates the Christian. It is pretty plain to see by what is happening in the Muslim countries.
