Many things strive for our affection, and time, and attention, and it seems we continually need to evaluate where we're focusing our lives. Because of this, God's people are exhorted to find their security in Him and not other gods (Judg. 18:13-16). Jesus reiterated this in His discussion of the commandments: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind" (Matthew 22:37). The Lord alone is our "help and shield" (Psalm 115:9). May we reserve our worship for Him. God is most worthy of our affection.
