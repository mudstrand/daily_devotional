The "path... that seems right" may offer many options and require few sacrifices. Easy choice, however, should make us take a second look. Is this solution attractive because it allows me to be lazy—because it does not ask me to change my lifestyle—because it requires no moral restraints? The right choice often requires hard work and self-sacrifice. Don't be enticed by apparent shortcuts that seem right but end in death.
