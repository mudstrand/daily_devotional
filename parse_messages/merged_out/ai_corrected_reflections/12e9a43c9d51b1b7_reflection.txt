Praise to the God of all comfort. Paul begins verse 3 with worship to the God who brings grace and peace. Yes, our Lord is worthy to be praised and worshiped. Who comforts us? Let us remember that a Christian's comfort comes through the message of reconciliation with God through the work of Jesus Christ. This letter also shows how believers are agents of God's consolation and comfort for others.
