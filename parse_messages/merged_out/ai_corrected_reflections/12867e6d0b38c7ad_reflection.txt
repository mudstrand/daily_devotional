Do you hear what He promises you? Just think of it! He who keeps the whole world running and the whole human race alive, promises that He will especially bless and keep you. "We are the apple of [His] eye," He reminds us in (Psalm 17:8). "The sheep of His pasture" (Psalm 100:3). What can be more precious to Him than those whom He has made His beloved children in Christ? What can be more wonderful than what the true God offers: "[I will] bless you and keep you."
