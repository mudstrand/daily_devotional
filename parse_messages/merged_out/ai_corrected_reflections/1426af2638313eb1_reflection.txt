Seventy-two Psalms—almost half the book—speak about enemies. Enemies are those who oppose not only us, but also God's way of living. Give this some thought—we can view temptations—money, success, prestige, lust—as our enemies. Of course, Satan is our greatest enemy. David asked God to keep his enemies from overcoming him because they opposed what God stood for. If his enemies succeeded, David feared that many would think that trusting God was futile. We too should not want our enemies' success to be an obstacle to the faith of others.
