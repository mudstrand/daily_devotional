If you are facing battles you feel you can't possibly win, don't give up. In the midst of numerous problems, pray for God's help, admit to Him that you are powerless. The secret of victory is to first admit to the futility of unaided human effort and then to trust God to save. His power works best through those who recognize their limitations (2 Corinthians 12:9). It is those who think they can do it all on their own who are in the greatest danger.
