While waterfalls can provide a measure of power and electricity, we know that Jesus is mightier than the waters He created. All of nature is merely a limited expression of His supreme majesty, and here is some good news. Nobody has to go on vacation to see the natural wonder of the Lord's glory. We see Him in the stars, a rose petal, and a butterfly. We see the Lord's face in the morning sun.
