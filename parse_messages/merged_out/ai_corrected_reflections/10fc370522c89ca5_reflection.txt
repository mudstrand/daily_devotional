What does it mean that Christ is changeless ("You will remain the same")? It means that Christ's character will never change. He persistently shows His love to us. He is always fair, just, and merciful to us who are so undeserving. Be thankful that Christ is changeless; He will always help you when you need it and offer goodness when you fall.
