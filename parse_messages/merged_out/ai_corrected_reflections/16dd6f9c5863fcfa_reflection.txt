The well-being of the people was always to be of the utmost importance to the Lord. The Sabbath Law, Jesus taught, was never intended to prevent works of love or needful action when someone was in need. The law of love always takes precedence. For us as New Testament people, our freedom is clearly established. Jesus eliminated the ceremonial dos and don'ts. He fulfilled the whole law of God for us by His obedience, His death on the cross, and His resurrection.
