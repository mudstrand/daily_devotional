Because David trusted in God, God would not let him stumble (be removed from his throne). When we trust in God, we have permanence and stability. We may lose a great deal, such as families, jobs, material possessions, but we cannot be shaken from God's favor. He will be our foundation, our solid rock. He will never leave or desert us.
