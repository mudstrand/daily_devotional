The "path of the upright" doesn't always seem easy (15:19), but look at the alternatives. Hatred (15:17), dissension (15:18), and laziness (15:19) all cause problems that an upright person does not have to face. By comparison, his or her life is a smooth, level road because it is built on a solid foundation of love for God.
