God supplies us with more so we can give more. In addition, giving helps us gain a right perspective of our possessions. We should come to realize they were never ours to begin with, but they were given to us by God to be used to help others. So what do we gain by giving? Freedom from enslavement to our possessions, the joy of helping others, and God's approval!
