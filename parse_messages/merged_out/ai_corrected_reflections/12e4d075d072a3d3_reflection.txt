What Paul is doing is encouraging the regenerate to do good works. He clearly presents them with the 10 Commandments. Then he adds, "Love your neighbor." Jesus similarly identifies this as an apt summary of the Law (Matthew 22:37-40). How can this be? It is because love is to place another person before self; this is to be a "living sacrifice."
