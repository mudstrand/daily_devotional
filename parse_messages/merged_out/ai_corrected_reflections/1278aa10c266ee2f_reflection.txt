They praised Jesus with their lips and hands that first Palm Sunday. The disciples did it by following Jesus' orders and fetching the donkey. The people did it by rolling out the red carpet of their own cloaks and palm branches. Yes, they eagerly praised Him, even though few fully knew the right reason why. Today, we celebrate this event on Palm Sunday. That day should remind us to guard against superficial acclaim of Christ.
