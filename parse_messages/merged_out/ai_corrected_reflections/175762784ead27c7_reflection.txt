With this verse, let us start thinking and ask ourselves: "What does money mean to me?" Jesus showed genuine love for this man, even though He knew this man may not follow Him. True love is able to give tough advice; it does not hedge on the truth. Remember, Christ loved us enough to die for us, and He also loves us enough to talk straight to us. If His love were superficial, He would give us only His approval; but because His love is complete, He gives us life-changing challenges.
