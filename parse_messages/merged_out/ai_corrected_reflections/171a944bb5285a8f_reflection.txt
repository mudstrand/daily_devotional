Jesus looked at people and knew exactly what they needed. He confronted the Pharisees' hypocrisy (Matthew 23). He knew the woman who touched His robe needed a personal encounter besides physical healing (Luke 8:43-48). Jesus wants to pinpoint the cause of our painful symptoms and show us the cure. He is waiting for us to consult Him.
