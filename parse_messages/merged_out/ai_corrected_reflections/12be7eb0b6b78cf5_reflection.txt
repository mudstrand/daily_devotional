A missionary is someone sent by Jesus Christ just as He was sent by God. The great controlling factor is not the needs of the people, but the command of Jesus. The source of our inspiration in our service to God is behind us, not ahead of us. The tendency today is to put the inspiration out in front—to sweep everything together in front of us and make it conform to our definition of success. But in the New Testament the inspiration is put behind us, and is the Lord Jesus Himself. The goal is to be true to Him—to carry out His plans.
