Eternal life is a gift from God. If it is a gift, then it is not something we have earned, nor something that must be paid back. Our salvation is a gift of God, not something of our own doing (Ephesians 2:8, 9). He saved us because of His mercy, not because of any good things that we have done (Titus 3:5). Oh, how much more we should accept with thanksgiving the gift that God has freely given us.
