Offending others when standing for the truth is inevitable. We can't control how others receive our words, but we can control the manner in which we present them. Jesus never stooped to name-calling or verbally tearing apart the character of anyone who disagreed with Him. Neither should we. Our role is to follow His example and trust His Holy Spirit to change the hearts of those who take offense.
