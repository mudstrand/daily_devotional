Prayer is a two-way conversation, not a monologue. Jesus wants to speak to us and calm our fears, offer guidance, and assure us of His loving presence. We can miss His voice if we're solely focused on our own agenda. But Jesus knows us intimately; He also knows what our day holds. So when it comes to prayer, we should be glad to let Him dominate the conversation.
