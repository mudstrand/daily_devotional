Being born again takes a moment of faith, but becoming like Christ is a lifelong process. As Paul has been emphasizing since the beginning of this letter, no one in the world is innocent. No one deserves to be saved, not the pagan who doesn't know God's laws, not the Christian or Jew who knows them and tries to keep them. All of us must depend totally on the work of Christ for our salvation. We cannot earn it by our good behavior.
