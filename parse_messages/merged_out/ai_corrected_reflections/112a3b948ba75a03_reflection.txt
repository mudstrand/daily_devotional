Through the ages, the sin of pride has been unpleasing to God. Very often, the most judicious minds and the most learned philosophers have fallen into gross foolishness when they have cast aside the fear of God in their claim to be wise. They have made fools of themselves, substituting all manner of idolatry in an effort to satisfy their religious hunger. One needs to be careful not to fall into the sin of pride, because more often than not, that person will also cast aside God for some material object.
