Jesus is talking about a new relationship between the believer and God. Before this, people approached God through priests. After Jesus' resurrection, any believer could approach God directly. A new day has dawned, and now all believers are priests, talking with God personally and directly. This is what we see in Hebrews 10:17-23. We approach God, not because of our own merit, but because Jesus, our great High Priest, has made us acceptable to God.
