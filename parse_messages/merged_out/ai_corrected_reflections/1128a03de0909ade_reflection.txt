There are many who regard the Gospel of Jesus Christ as foolishness. To be identified as a witness of the Gospel means that one may be counted as foolish, and persecution may follow. Paul knew the consequences of this identity with the Gospel, and he was not ashamed. The Gospel of Christ demands unconditional surrender of the intellect and the will. Of course, this is not pleasing to the nature of man. The independence that he loves so much is threatened. The Gospel is not loved by the unbelieving world. The main reason for Paul's boldness regarding the Gospel was that "it is the power of God for salvation." The benefit of this power is received by "everyone who has faith."
