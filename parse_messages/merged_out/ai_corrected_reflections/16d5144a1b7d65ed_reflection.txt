God's commission to our first parents is still in effect. We, their descendants, are still to exercise a wise dominion over all nature. Beyond good stewardship of our natural resources, God calls us to an even greater responsibility and privilege, that is to be witnesses to all the world concerning His saving love in Christ Jesus, His Son and our only Savior. [What a joy and privilege.]
