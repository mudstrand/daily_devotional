Paul says that those who become Christians are invited by Jesus to (1) belong to God's family and (2) be His very own people. What a wonderful expression of what it means to be a Christian! In being reborn into God's family, we have the greatest experience of love and the greatest inheritance. Because of all that God has done for us, we should strive to be His holy people.
