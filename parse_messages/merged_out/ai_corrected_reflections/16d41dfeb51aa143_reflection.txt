God desires that we be faithful and thoughtful stewards of all His creation. Also belonging to God as His precious possessions are the people inhabiting the earth. Christians recognize God's ownership of them as His people. He has not only made them, He has redeemed them. "You are not your own. You were bought with a price" (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). St. Peter told us what that price was: "The precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect" (1 Peter 1:19). God is our Landlord; we are mere renters, tenants, stewards.
