It should be natural for children to trust their parents, even though parents sometimes fail to keep their promises. Our Heavenly Father, however, never makes promises He won't keep. But we need to remember His timing is different from ours, so His plan may take longer than we expect. So instead of acting like impatient children as we wait for God's will to unfold, we need to have confidence in God's perfect timing and wisdom.
