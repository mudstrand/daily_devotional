God is the Creator. The Bible begins with the majestic story of His creation of the universe, and it concludes with His creation of a new heaven and a new earth. This is a tremendous hope and encouragement for the believer. When we are with God, with our sins forgiven and our future secure, we will be like Christ. We will be made perfect like Him.
