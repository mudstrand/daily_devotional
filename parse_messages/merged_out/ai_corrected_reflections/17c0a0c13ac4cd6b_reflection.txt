What we see in this proverb is an excuse a lazy person might use to avoid going to work. To me, this excuse is truly ridiculous if you live in northern Minnesota. Yes, the excuse sounds silly to us, but that's how our excuses may sound to others. Let us not rationalize laziness. Let us take our responsibilities seriously and get to work. Let us never be lazy, but let us serve the Lord enthusiastically.
