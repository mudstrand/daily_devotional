Before Jesus came to earth, He was one with God. At this point, when His mission on earth was almost finished, Jesus was asking His Father to restore Him to His original place of honor and authority. Jesus' resurrection and ascension—and Stephen's dying exclamation (Acts 7:56)—give evidence to the fact that Jesus did return to His exalted position at the right hand of God. The fact that this took place is the assurance that a believer will one day inherit eternal life.
