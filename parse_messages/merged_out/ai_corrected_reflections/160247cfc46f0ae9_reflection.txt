Only Christ's crucified body can effect so great a task as to reconcile and reunite hostile members of the human race. Christ is the world's only hope. Christ's body, the church, is the one new man, made up of new men (2 Corinthians 5:17). Christ puts an end to hostility between God and man and between man and man.
