When and if we allow God, our Shepherd, to guide us, we will have contentment. When we choose to sin and go our own way, we cannot blame God for the environment we create for ourselves. Our Shepherd knows the "green meadows" and "peaceful streams" that will restore us. We can only reach these places by obediently following Him. (Think about this) - rebelling against the Shepherd's leading is actually rebelling against our own best interests. Let us remember this the next time we are tempted to go our own way rather than the Shepherd's way.
