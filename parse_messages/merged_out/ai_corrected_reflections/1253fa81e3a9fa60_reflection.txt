YES, JESUS WANTS US TO BE READY TO TRAVEL WITH HIM. HOW? HE WANTS US TO KEEP OUR LAMP OF FAITH BURNING. HOW? "BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO HEAR THE WORD OF GOD AND OBEY IT," HE SAYS (LUKE 11:28). THROUGH HIS APOSTLE, HE URGES, "LET THE WORD OF CHRIST DWELL IN YOU RICHLY" (COLOSSIANS 3:16). CONSTANT CONTACT WITH GOD'S WORD KEEPS FAITH'S STRENGTH UP, ITS EYES OPEN, ITS ATTITUDE EXPECTANT. MY FAITH NEEDS ITS OIL REGULARLY REPLENISHED WITH THE MESSAGE OF GOD'S SAVING LOVE IN CHRIST JESUS. MY FAITH NEEDS REGULAR STRENGTHENING BY THE SPIRIT'S WORK THROUGH THAT GOSPEL IF I'M TO BE READY TO TRAVEL. HOW TO STAY AWAKE? THE ANSWER'S SO SIMPLE: LIVE IN HIS WORD. IT WILL PROVIDE THE OIL FOR YOUR LAMP OF FAITH.
