Jesus is talking about a new relationship between the believer and God. Previously, people had to approach God through priests. Since Jesus' resurrection, any believer can now approach God directly. Yes, a new day has dawned, and now all believers are priests, talking with God personally and directly (see Hebrews 10:19-23). Now, we also need to remember, we do not approach God because of our own merit, but because Jesus, our great High Priest, has made us acceptable to God.
