In the Christian life, we battle against rulers and authorities (the powerful evil forces of fallen angels headed by Satan, who is a victorious fighter, see 1 Peter 5:8). To withstand their attacks, we must depend on God's strength and use every part of His armor. Paul is not only giving this counsel to the church, the body of Christ, but to all individuals within the church. The whole body needs to be armed. As you do battle against the "mighty powers of darkness," fight in the strength of the church, whose power comes from the Holy Spirit.
