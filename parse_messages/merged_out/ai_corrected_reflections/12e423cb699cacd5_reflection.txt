What kind of love is this? Despite all our selfishness and sinfulness, He has loved us. In (1 John 3:1), we are even called His own children. God's love is unique because it is not what our corrupt, sinful nature deserves; it is not what our thoughts, words, and deeds have earned. God has even promised that He has made us His children. Despite the lies, deceptions, and partial truths of the world, God has never lied to us, and He has never failed to do what He has promised. You can count on Him.
