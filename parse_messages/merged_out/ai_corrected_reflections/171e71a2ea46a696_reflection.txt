John's willingness to decrease in importance shows unusual humility. Many Christian leaders are often tempted to focus more on their own success than on the God who gives us the ability. Beware of those who put more emphasis on their own achievements than on God's Kingdom. A question we need to ask ourselves is: Are there any parts of my life where I need to invite Jesus to increase?
