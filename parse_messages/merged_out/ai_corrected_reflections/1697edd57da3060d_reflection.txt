It is so easy to become spiritually bowed down by the burdens of life. So often we find ourselves discouraged by the problems we face and the needs of those we love. But if we consider God's care, His great power, and His loving heart, we can begin to look up and praise Him. We can walk through each day knowing that the "Lord reigns forever." (Psalm 146:10) He lifts us up when we are bowed down. Praise the Lord.
