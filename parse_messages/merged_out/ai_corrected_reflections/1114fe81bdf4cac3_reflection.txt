To neglect Christian meetings is to give up the encouragement and help of other Christians. We should gather together to share our faith and to strengthen one another in the Lord. As we get closer to the day when Christ will return, we will face many spiritual struggles, and even times of persecution. Anti-Christian forces will grow in strength. But difficulties should never be an excuse for missing church service. Rather, as difficulties arise, we should make an even greater effort to be faithful in attendance.
