In order to pray, being led by the Holy Spirit, we need to build up the foundation of our faith. To pray as we are directed by the Holy Spirit means to pray in the power and strength of the Holy Spirit. He prays for us (Romans 8:26, 27). He opens our mind to Jesus (John 14:26), and He teaches us about Him (John 15:26). John warns us to live close to God and His people, not listening to false teachers who would try to pull us away from Him (1 John 2:19, 20).
