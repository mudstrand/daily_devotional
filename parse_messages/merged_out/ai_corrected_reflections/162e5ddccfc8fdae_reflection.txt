"Ways used for a pattern of behavior or custom." "The way of the Lord" is twofold: He punishes sinfulness, but He also shows mercy to the repentant. Jesus describes Himself as the "way" in (John 14:6). "Granting an inheritance to those who love Me." This is the riches that come to those who follow God's Wisdom, the Christ, are celebrated in several NT passages. Paul speaks of the rich inheritance of those who are in Christ (Ephesians 1:3-14).
