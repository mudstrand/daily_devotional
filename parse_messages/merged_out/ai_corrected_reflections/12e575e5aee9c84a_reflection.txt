The material blessings enjoyed by families should be pursued by prudent and diligent work done honestly. God blesses such labor and uses it to provide for the needs of His people. We should be careful to not forget that it is God who provides us with all that we need to support our body and life. We should also never resort to wickedness or dishonesty in an attempt to secure a better life for ourselves. The righteousness that comes through faith in Jesus not only delivers from death, but it also ensures that our Heavenly Father will provide us with everything we need.
