We should notice that this doxology is a prayer of praise to God for the wisdom of His plan. Even though God's methods and means are beyond our comprehension, God Himself is not arbitrary. He governs the universe and our life in perfect wisdom, justice, and love. He governs us by His love—that is why we don't receive what we deserve.
