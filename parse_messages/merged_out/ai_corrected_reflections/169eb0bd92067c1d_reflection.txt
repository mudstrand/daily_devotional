We see that God gave Jeremiah a direct call, "Before you were born I set you apart." (Jeremiah 1:5) God did protect Jeremiah, but his ministry never thrived because his people never repented. Jeremiah knew that God did not call him to success but to faithfulness. He trusted the God who called him. Jeremiah shows us the heart of the Father, who yearns for everyone to turn to Him. BEWARE OF GIVING UP TOO SOON. OUR EMOTIONS ARE NOT RELIABLE.
