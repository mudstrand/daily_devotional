The Jews were proud of the fact that their lineage came from Isaac, whose mother was Sarah (Abraham's legitimate wife), rather than Ishmael, whose mother was Hagar (Sarah's servant). Paul makes it very clear that no one can claim to be chosen by God because of his or her heritage or good deeds. God freely chooses to save whomever He wills. In the doctrine of election, we are taught that God's sovereign choice to save us is by His goodness and mercy, not by our own merit.
