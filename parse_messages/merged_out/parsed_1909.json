We can prepare the soil, fertilize\nit, irrigate, and sow the seeds. But that is all we can do.\nWe cannot put the germinating power into the seed itself.\nThat is the way it is with the Word of God, the Gospel of\nJesus Christ. As Christians we proclaim it in our\nneighborhoods and to the world at large. We prepare\nourselves, speak words people can understand, use the media\nat our disposal, and the like. But there is a limit to what\nwe can do. When it comes to producing results in\npeople—creating the saving, heart changing faith—we can do\nnothing at all. “No man can redeem the life of another or\ngive God a ransom for him” (Psalm 49:7). The Gospel has\nwonderful Power “ for the salvation of everyone who\nbelieves” (Romans 1:16). It is the Triune God who effects our\nsalvation.",
