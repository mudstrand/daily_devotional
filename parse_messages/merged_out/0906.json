When he said: \"I have been crucified with Christ, \" it was not only an inner spiritual truth, but an actual, practical experience in relation to the world and its temptations. Paul boasts that he lives as one crucified to the world, and that now the world as a powerless enemy was crucified to him. It was this that made him glory in the cross of Christ. O Christian friends, when the world crucified Christ, it crucified you with Him. When Christ overcame the world on the cross, he made you an overcome too. He calls you now, at whatever cost of self-denial, to regard the world in its hostility to God and His Kingdom as a crucified enemy over whom the cross can ever keep you conqueror. What a different relationship to the pleasures and attractions of the world the Christian has who by the Holy Spirit has learned to say: \"I have been crucified with Christ; the crucified Christ liveth in me\"!",
