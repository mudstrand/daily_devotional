But it seems that all do not appear to consider that the very last command, not to preach until they had received the power from on high is equally binding on us as it was on the disciples. The Church appears to have lost possession of that which ought to be to her a secret of secrets ~ the abiding consciousness, day by day, that it is only as she lives in the power of the Holy Spirit that she can preach the Gospel in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.

Lets remember they were simple, unlearned men with many faults, but whom the Lord had called to forsake all and follow Him. And oh yes we must also remember, They had done this, as far as they could: they followed Him in the life He led and the work He did. Oh yes like us there was much sin in them and they had as yet no power to fully deny themselves, but at the same time their hearts clung to Him in deep sincerity. Even in the midst of much stumbling they still followed Him to the cross. They shared with Him His death; unconsciously but most really, they died with Him to sin and were raised with Him in the power of new life.

Think of your own neighborhood and all the saints you know; think of our whole country and praise God for all who are His saints; think of all Christian nations of the world and the saints to be found in each of these; think of all the heathen nations and the saints of God to be found among them in ever-increasing numbers. Think of all the different circumstances and conditions in which these are to be found and all the varying needs which call for God's grace and help. Think of the many, oh, so many, who are God's saints and yet through ignorance or sloth, through worldly-mindedness or an evil heart of unbelief are walking in the dark and bringing no honor to God. Think of so many who are in earnest and yet conscious of a life of failure, with little or no power to please God or to bless man. And then think again of those who are found everywhere, in solitary places or in companies, whose one aim is to serve the Lord who bought them to be the light of those around them.

Are there not many who confess that they desire to live wholly for God? Are there not many who acknowledge that Christ gave Himself for them? Are there not many who say that In His love He watches over them and works in them without ceasing? And aren't there many that admit that nothing less than the measure of the love of Christ to us should be the measure of our love to Him? Don't they also feel that this ought to be the standard of their life? If this be true, shouldn't they welcome every opportunity for proving day by day that they are devoting their heart's strength to the interest of Christ's Kingdom and to the prayer that can bring down God's blessing?

But in many cases there is a lack of that largehearted and universal love that takes up all the saints of God and their service into His embrace. There is not the boldness and the strength that comes from the consciousness of being part of a large and conquering army under the leadership of our conquering King.
