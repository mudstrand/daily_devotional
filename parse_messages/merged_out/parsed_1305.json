Some of us overestimate ourselves-the key to an honest and accurate self-evaluation is knowing the basis of our self-worth-our identity in Christ. Apart from Him, we aren't capable of very much by eternal standards; in Him, capable of worthy service. Evaluating ourselves by the worldly standards of success and achievements can cause us to think too much about our worth in the eyes of others and so miss our true value in God's eyes.",
