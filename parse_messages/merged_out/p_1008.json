    "reflection": "I'm afraid that our peace often is based simply on our own ignorance. But when we are awakened to the realities of life, true inner peace is impossible unless it is received from Jesus. When our Lord speaks peace, He creates peace, because the words He speaks are always, \"spirit, and they are life\" (John 6:63). Are you severely troubled right now? ~ Are you afraid and confused by the waves and the turbulence God sovereignty allows to enter your life? Have you left no stone of your faith upturned, yet still not found any well of peace, joy, or comfort? ~ Does your life seem completely barren to you? ~ Then its time to look up and receive the quiet contentment of the Lord Jesus. ~ Reflecting His peace is proof that you are right with God, because you are exhibiting the freedom to turn you mind to Him. If you are not right with God, you can never turn your mind anywhere but on yourself. If there is a problem pressing in on you right now, are you \"looking unto Jesus\" (Hebrews 12:2) and receiving peace from Him? Lay everything out before Him, and when you are faced with difficulty, bereavement, and sorrow, listen to Him say, \"Let not your heart be troubled.\"",
