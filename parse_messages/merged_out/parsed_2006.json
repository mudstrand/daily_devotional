I can no longer pray “lead us not into temptation.” I now pray, “Do not allow us be led into temptation by Satin.” I do believe a lot of people who live for God often wonder why they still have temptations. Does God tempt them? God tests people, but He does not tempt them by trying to seduce them to sin. However, God, does allow Satin to tempt people, in order to refine\ntheir faith and to help them grow in their dependence upon Christ. We can resist the temptation to sin by turning to God for strength and by choosing to obey His Word.",
