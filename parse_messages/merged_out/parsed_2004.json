Her world ended with Jesus’ death.\nHe was her teacher, but much more, Jesus\nloved her not only for what she was, but who she wanted to be. The world looks at the outside—God sees the heart. I believe Jesus saw her desperation, how lost she was without Him. And though He felt compassion, He wanted her to move on from that place. From now on she needed to learn to walk in communion with the Holy Spirit. Are there aspects of your faith you need to release in order to move onward and upward with Jesus?",
