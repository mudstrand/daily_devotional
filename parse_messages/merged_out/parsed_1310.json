    "original_reflection_text": "Was David saying he was sinless? Far be it-for a proud assumption of purity. David's claim was an understanding of his relationship with God. In Psalm 32 and 51, David freely acknowledged his own sins. Nevertheless his relationship with God one of close fellowship and constant repentance and forgiveness. His claim to goodness, therefore was based on his continual seeking after God. Let's always examine our own relationship with God does it result from constant repentance resulting in the assurance of forgiveness?",

They worry that they may have committed a sin unknowingly-or have done something good with selfish intentions-or failed to put their whole heart into a task-or have neglected what they should have done- Guilt can play an important part in bringing us to Christ and keeping us behaving properly-but it should not cripple us or make us fearful.
