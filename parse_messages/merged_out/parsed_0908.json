    "reflection": "What do you do with a hammer? ~~~ It depends doesn't it? You can use it to tear down ~~~ or to build up? When walls need replacement, first you hammer away at the old. When its knocked down, you pound into place the new. Its the same with fire ~~~ you can use it to destroy debris or to ignite a jet engine. Have you ever thought about God's Word as a hammer or a fire? Like some hammer it pounds away the sin-hardened heart. Nothing but the force of God's gospel can make a dent in an unbeliever's heart. Only its mighty blows can tear down the unbelief that rules in the sinful heart inherited from our parents ~~~ Like some fire God's gospel reduces to ashes the self -righteousness that packs the human heart. Only the gospel's purifying flames get rid of the human instinct to earn one's own salvation. So let us not use God's Word like some unused tool on the workbench of life ~~~ Lets reach for this hammer and fire regularly.",

And we'll thank God even as we try to harness those means to get His Word out. But the message will still be the same. It'll still be, \"See what God has done.\" It will point at the sinner with the chilling reminder of Gods law ~ what man has done can only doom him.

The word Jesus uses means a change of heart. Like with the cheating tax collector Zacchaeus. Repentance means admitting our sins, recognizing the hurt we have caused to our neighbor and Jesus, then making amends for those sins, and then fighting against them, (or turning from them). We need to understand the connect between repentance and salvation. It is only those who truly repent of their sins that will find in the gospel the good news they need. To those who don't feel their sins, repentance is only a term, not a treasure. Before we can enjoy Jesus' forgiveness, we need to understand His call to repentance.",
