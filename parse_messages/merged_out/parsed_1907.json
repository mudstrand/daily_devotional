    "original_reflection_text": "A man was having a little chat with his young son. He was trying to tell him what a Christian should be like and how he should act. When he was finished talking, his son looked at him and asked a stunning question. The boy asked, \"Daddy have I seen a Christian?\" What a telling commentary on the life of the father, and any other father. How would we feel if our children were to ask us this same question. Psalm 78 gives us some help in making sure that doesn't happen. It sets forth a pattern for parenting. Be sure to read the first 7 verses of Psalm 78. Here is a point to remember: CHILDREN MAY CLOSE THEIR EARS TO ADVICE, BUT THEY KEEP THEIR EYES OPEN TO EXAMPLE.",
