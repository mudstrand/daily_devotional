I was recently reminded that while I can do all things through Jesus, He never said I had to do it all. I’m the one who puts the pressure on myself. Sometimes the thing He wants to give me is strength for speaking that powerful little word, “No.”\nJesus wants us to get our value from Him. Not from doing all things. But from resting in His love for us and letting His strength shine through our weakness. But how can we do that if we never admit we have a weakness? What’s the hardest thing you have to do today?",
