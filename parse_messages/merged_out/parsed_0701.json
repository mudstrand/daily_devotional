    "reflection": "Have you ever wondered how Jesus was made perfect through suffering? Well the suffering that Jesus accepted on our behalf made Him a perfect leader or pioneer, of our salvation. Jesus Himself did not need to suffer for His own salvation, because He was God in human form. His perfect obedience (which led Him down the road of suffering) demonstrates that He was the complete sacrifice for us. Through suffering, Jesus completed the work necessary for our own salvation. Our suffering can make us more sensitive servants of God. People who have known pain are able to reach out with compassion to others who hurt. If you have suffered, ask God how your experience can be used to help others.",

In both cases, the difficulties of the present moment overshadowed the reality of God's promise, and the people doubted that God would fulfill His promises. The problem many have today is that they trust in their own efforts instead of Christ's power, then they are in danger of turning back. They will eventually see that their own efforts are never adequate; because only Christ can see us through.",

    "reflection": "Jesus was in great agony as He prepared to faced death (Luke 22:41-44). Although Jesus cried out to God, asking to be delivered, He was prepared to suffer humiliation, separation from His Father, and death in order to do God's will. At times we will undergo trials, not because we want to suffer, but because we want to obey God. Let Jesus' obedience sustain and encourage you in times of trial. You will be able to face anything if you know that Jesus Christ is with you. Have you ever felt that God didn't hear your prayers? Be sure you are praying with reverent submission, willing to do what God wants. God responds to His obedient children.",
    "prayer": "Dear Heavenly Father, I can not even imagine what You felt as You approached the time of Your separation from Your Father, but I do thank You for being obedient to the Father's will. I pray for a greater sensitivity and obedience to His will. I pray for obedience that I may become a better witness for Him, in Jesus name Amen.",
