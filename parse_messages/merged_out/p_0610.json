    "reflection": "Jesus knew all along who would be the one to betray Him. Judas was the “one headed for destruction, ” who was lost because he betrayed Jesus and never sought forgiveness. Judas chose his own path and suffered the consequences, just as we will if we chose not to seek forgiveness. One of the most common themes of Jesus' teachings is 'joy'. He wants us to be joyful--I think the saddest thing is to see Christians walk around with long faces. What kind of witness is that??? The key to immeasurable joy is living in intimate contact with Christ, the source of all joy. If we have an intimate relationship with Christ, we will experience God's special care and protection and see the victory He brings even when defeat seems certain. Do you want to be a better witness??? “SMILE”",

    "reflection": "It is strange how these Jewish leaders were more concerned about their ceremonial laws than they were about putting to death an innocent person. They kept the ceremonial requirements of their religion while harboring murder and treachery in their hearts. When asked what the charges were, they couldn't even give an answer. But is our sin any less, when we neglect to attend worship—or when we neglect to give thanks, or when we neglect to give to the poor??? Didn't Jesus Himself say, “Whatever you do to the least of these, you do to Me”? When we neglect to do these things, we are really disobeying our Lord. We may not have outright murder in our heart, but being disobedient is the same as saying the Lord's will is unimportant.",

The sign that Pilate had placed about Jesus' head read, “JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS,” was meant to be a mockery. A king stripped nearly naked and executed in public view would seemingly cause most to believe that He had lost His kingdom forever. BUT Jesus, who turns the world's wisdom upside down, was just coming into His Kingdom. His death and resurrection would strike the deathblow to Satan's rule and would establish Jesus' eternal authority over the earth.
