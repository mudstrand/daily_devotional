    "reflection": "What's a person to do? The world in which we have to live and breath is becoming increasingly polluted. All around us ~ in movies and TV ~ in adds and commercials ~ and even within some churches, beats the appealing chant that man can have it all ~ do it all ~ ignore it all. SO what are we supposed to do??? Do we just shrug our shoulders and ask what else is new? ~ Do we just throw in the towel and surrender? Do we just say, thank God we have gray hair and won't see what our grandchildren will have to face??? Or should we join David in today's verse? He raised his face to heaven, and what he saw comforted him. The sinful efforts of the world aren't enough to make the One who sits on heaven's throne even leave His seat. Their feeble attempts to war against Him and His own are only enough to make Him laugh. The Almighty Ruler of all has never heard anything so humorous as man's empty boasting. He's never seen anything so funny as mankind's incompetent attempts to get along without Him. Yes we must all agree, times are evil. But we're not going to give up. Why should we? We're going to win! He who sits in the heavens is laughing, and we with Him. His Word still stands. His ways will still endure. And when the dust settles in the future as in the past, it will be victory that we shall see.",

They are efforts we should put forward in a willing, grateful response to what the Savior has done for our salvation. Of course, such actions cover our whole lives. We want everything in word and deed to be done to His glory. But one privilege stands out above all others. That's the work the risen Savior has given us ~ to be His witnesses. We who have seen His cross and empty tomb need to tell others. We need to share with the needy the Good News of the forgiveness of sins. On the job??? Perhaps we can't all become a pastor or a teacher. Perhaps we can't all fly to distant continents or move to expanding areas of our country. But we can still witness. We can tell the child on our lap, we can tell the neighbor down the street, we can tell a coworker on the job about the Jesus who loves them. We can speak our prayers and we can bring our offerings for the spreading of the gospel.",
