    "reflection": "From An Embarrassed Waitress: A young girl sat at the counter of an ice cream store. “How much is an ice cream Sunday?” she asked. “Fifty cents,” the waitress answered with hardly a glance at the child. The girl opened her fist and counted her coins. She asked, “how much is a dish of plain ice cream?” Annoyed, the waitress snapped, “thirty five cents!” The girl counted out 35 cents and handed it to the waitress. “I’ll take the plain Ice cream.” The waitress took the money without a word and brought the ice cream. After the small customer had eaten and left, while the waitress was cleaning up, suddenly became flushed with shame. There, neatly beside the dish were two nickels and five pennies-her tip.
