Jesus calls the man in the parable a \"fool\" not because of his laboring but because all he could talk about was \"I\" and \"Mine\". All that man could think about was how much he could get. The same temptation is there for us. We eat vitamin-enriched foods, ride in air-conditioned cars, whatch TV programs beamed across the miles, lose our anxieties by taking pills, die without pain because of modern drugs, and are laid to rest in park-like cemeteries. All this we have and most of it is good. But what good is my life if it revolves only around these things. As the man in the parable ~ we cannot prolong our life a single second, pay God for a single sin, or buy one square inch of heaven. Are you too asking the wrong question, one about getting instead of giving??? To be rich toward God means to treasure the pardon He has prepared for us in Christ, to use our earthly treasures for the spreading of His Word, to look forward to our rich inheritance with Him in heaven. Labor? For what? The question is simple, deceptively so. The answer is serious, eternally so.",

It's at the root of all the worlds problems.\nSin is the soil in which the troubles of man grow ~ all his pains,\ntemptations, even death...\n\nEvery day the dandelions of sin shoot up in my heart, threatening to\nchoke out all else. Daily I must confess that I sin much and deserve \nnothing but punishment...\n\nSo what do I do? ~ Pick up the cell phone and call 911?\n\nMan can't help me, but God did. He sent His Son to pay sin's penalty\nand destroy sin's curse...\n\nOn the cross he provided the only help that works, His Son's blood\nin payment for all my sins and as power against sin's temptations...\n\nThrough His Word He stands at my (our) side with that forgiveness.\nHis Word is our \"cell phone.\"\n\nPrayer Suggestion:\nBe near me Lord Jesus, to help me with my sins and \nbless me with Your forgiveness...Amen.\n\nPs.

Life is a gift that only God can give ~ Every moment of our life is His gift to us. Just as with other gifts from God, life has a purpose, In fact, it purpose makes life a most precious gift. It's the time a loving God grants each individual to learn of the Savior Jesus and be readied for heaven through Him. Because of this purpose, God carefully protects life, commanding others to keep their sinful hands off the time of grace He gives each person. Only the blood of God's own Son could pay the ransom required to restore sinful man to his Creator. That God should send His Son to pay the ultimate price of His atoning death plainly indicates what value God has attached to people.

Unfortunately, some still misunderstand that salvation is something done for us not by us. We need to note that Jesus uses the word inheritance. An inheritance is a gift from the donor not some wage earned by my efforts. So the kingdom of heaven is God's free gift, graciously willed to me because of what His Son has done.
