The same temptation is there for us. We eat vitamin-enriched foods, ride in air-conditioned cars, whatch TV programs beamed across the miles, lose our anxieties by taking pills, die without pain because of modern drugs, and are laid to rest in park-like cemeteries. All this we have and most of it is good. But what good is my life if it revolves only around these things. As the man in the parable ~ we cannot prolong our life a single second, pay God for a single sin, or buy one square inch of heaven. Are you too asking the wrong question, one about getting instead of giving??? To be rich toward God means to treasure the pardon He has prepared for us in Christ, to use our earthly treasures for the spreading of His Word, to look forward to our rich inheritance with Him in heaven. Labor? For what? The question is simple, deceptively so. The answer is serious, eternally so.",

We need to remember, Jesus doesn't talk about taking up a pillow and following Him ~ He mentions a cross. Jesus doesn't promise that the road of discipleship will be without a bump or danger from competing traffic. He describes our life as a race that requires every ounce of our endurance and every minute of faith's concentration.

That's how the world entices us to feel. But how soon my muscles turn to flab. It may be an illness that pushes me on the ropes, and I throw in the towel.

Deep down I realize when my end comes, I must give an accounting to Him. Speak about weakness ~ here's an area where I have no strength or muscles at all.\"I am weak but He is strong, \" an old spiritual says. Yes God is the strength of my life ~ He helps me climb the steepest mountain, cross the deepest river, cross the widest desert of life. God is the rock of my salvation.
