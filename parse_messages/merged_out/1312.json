    "prayer": "Heavenly Father, we confess that we are often tempted to find security in the fleeting things of this world, rather than in You alone. Forgive us for the times when our wealth, power, or status have made us feel invincible, causing us to drift from dependence on You.

Wealth, power, and fame usually have an intoxicating effect on people, making them feel self-secure and independent from God. But this false security can be easily shattered. Don't be trapped by the false security of prosperity. Instead, depend on God for your security, and you won't be shaken when worldly possessions disappear.",
