BUT then he also points us to the only detergent that can wash sin's stain completely out of our souls. That's the precious blood of Jesus, God's Son. His blood doesn't just brush off sin's outward stain but removes it completely. It doesn't leave any ugly residue but lifts it out totally. How is this possible? It is because that blood comes from the veins of Him who is not only man but God from all eternity. God who promised forgiveness is faithful. At Calvary's cross we see that He did not merely sweep sin under the carpet but demanded full payment from His Son as our substitute. That Son's suffering and death is the miracle whitener that cleanses even the most corrupt sinner and the most crimson stain.",
