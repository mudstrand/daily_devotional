The desire to keep up appearances and to accumulate more drives them to spend every penny they earn, and they stretch their credit to the limit. But anyone who spends all he has is spending more than he can afford. A wise person puts money aside for hard times. God approves of foresight and restraint. God's people need to examine their lifestyle to see whether their spending is God-pleasing or merely self-pleasing.",

    "prayer": "Heavenly Father, we confess that at times we are tempted to envy the prosperity of the wicked, who seem to flourish without regard for Your ways. Yet, we know that their success is fleeting, and their future is bleak. Help us to keep our hearts and minds fixed on You, for You are always with us, guiding and sustaining us. Grant us the wisdom to trust in Your plan, and the hope of a wonderful future that awaits those who follow You. May we find our true joy and security in Your presence, now and forevermore. Amen.",

    "reflection": "How easy it is to envy those who get ahead, unhampered by responsibility to God's laws. For a time, they do seem to prosper without paying any attention to what God wants, but they have no future. To those who follow Him, God promises a hope and a wonderful future, even if they do not realize it in this life.",
