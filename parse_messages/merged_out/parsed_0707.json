Paul presented to them the information of a righteous and holy God whose judgment is just. Contrasting to God's holiness he present the hypocrisy and ungodliness which was theirs. As responsible people of God he explains their advantages: 1) They bear the name of God's chosen people; 2) They possess God's written law; 3) The true God has be revealed to them; and 4) They have knowledge of God's will. They had been entrusted with the written law of God and had sufficient knowledge to distinguish between good and evil. However Paul does not count them so well qualified, and rendered a crushing blow to their supposed pride by questioning their fitness to lead the blind.",

If He saved the righteous, was Christ's sacrifice unnecessary? Paul shows that God forgave all human sin at the cross of Jesus. Old Testament believers looked forward in faith to Christ's coming and were saved, even though they did not know Jesus' name or the details of His earthly life. Unlike the Old Testament believers you know about God who loved the world so much that He gave His own Son (John 3:16). Have you put your trust in Him???",

Christianity is unique in that no good deed that we do will make us right with God. No amount of human achievement or personal goodness will close the gap between God's moral perfection and our imperfect daily performance. Good deeds are important, but they will not earn us eternal life. We are saved only by trusting in what God has done for us. (see Ephesians 2:8-10)",
