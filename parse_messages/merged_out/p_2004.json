    "prayer": "Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, reflecting on the profound encounter between Mary and the risen Lord. Like Mary, we have experienced the pain of loss and the longing for Your presence. Yet, in Your infinite wisdom, You call us to move forward, to walk in communion with the Holy Spirit. Help us to release the aspects of our faith that hold us back, that we may press onward and upward, ever growing in our relationship with You. May we see with the eyes of our heart, and find comfort in the knowledge that You see us, not for what we are, but for who we can become in You. We trust in Your perfect plan, and pray that Your Spirit would guide us, even as we navigate the uncertainties of this life. Amen.",

    "reflection": "Can you imagine what it would have been like to be Mary on that day? Her world ended with Jesus' death. He was her teacher, but much more. Jesus loved her not only for what she was, but who she wanted to be. The world looks at the outside—God sees the heart. I believe Jesus saw her desperation, how lost she was without Him. And though He felt compassion, He wanted her to move on from that place. From now on, she needed to learn to walk in communion with the Holy Spirit. Are there aspects of your faith you need to release in order to move onward and upward with Jesus?",
