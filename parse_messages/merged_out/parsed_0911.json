    "reflection": "No matter how tall my mountain of sin becomes, God's mountain of grace stands taller that He built on Calvary. I dig the pit of punishment for my sin so deep that, lying on its bottom, I can't even see the top. But God's hand of grace is always long enough to reach down to me. I earn death over and over again as the wages for my sins till I'd have to spend a zillion years in hell if eternity had time. But God's grace always has more than enough to cover my enormous debt. I simply cannot outsin His Grace. But I dare not let such a thought encourage me to sin all I want. Rather, God's more-than-enough grace is my comfort when I do fall into sin. Each night when I pray on my pillow, \"Forgive my sins, \" I don't have to add, \"If they aren't too many for Your grace.\" When my final night comes on this earth, I don't have to worry, \"Are some of my sins still there, not covered by His grace.\" No God's grace is always more than enough to cover all my sins.",

While looking at the\npicture, one little girl asked her father, \"Did He get in?\"\n\nGood question. Before I answer, I need to look at the one knocking. See the nail \nwounds in His hands? They tell me He has done what no one else could do for me. \nHe was wounded for my transgressions. With His stripes I am healed...\n\nLook at the door again ~ notice how overgrown it is with branches and vines? \nThey tell me what I couldn't do. The power of unbelief was something I couldn't chop away.\nI realize this because Christ Himself said, \"You did not choose Me, but I chose you,\" (Jn. 15:16).\n\nHe not only stands knocking at the door of my heart; He opens it with the power of the \ngospel.
