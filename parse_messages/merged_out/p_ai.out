FULL CORRECTED TEXT:
"Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, acknowledging that true security is found not in the wealth and possessions of this world, but in You alone. Help us to not be deceived by the false sense of security that material things can provide, but to instead place our trust fully in You, the source of all true and lasting riches. May we seek first Your kingdom and Your righteousness, knowing that all else will be provided for us. In Jesus' name, Amen."

"Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, seeking Your guidance and wisdom. As we read the words of the Psalmist and the wisdom found in Proverbs, we are reminded of the importance of steadfast love and faithfulness. Lord, help us not to grow weary in our prayers, but to trust in Your perfect timing and sovereign plan. May our faith be strengthened, even in the midst of unanswered prayers, for we know that You hear our cries and will answer according to Your will. We surrender ourselves to You, Lord, and pray that Your love and truth would be the foundation of our lives. Amen."
