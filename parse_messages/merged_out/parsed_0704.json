    "reflection": "apparently some were teaching that keeping the Old Testament ceremonial laws and rituals (such as not eating certain foods) was important for salvation. But these laws were useless for conquering a person's evil thoughts and desires (Colossians 2:23). Laws can influence conduct, but they can not change the heart. Lasting changes in conduct begin when the Holy Spirit lives in each person.",

I pray that the insurgents would have a change of heart and see that living in peace with one another will make for a brighter future. Amen.",

    "verse": "The high priests carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place as a sin offering, but the bodies are burned outside the camp. And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gates to make the people holy through His own blood. Let us, then. go to Him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace He bore. (Hebrews 13:11-13)",
    "reflection": "The Jewish Christians were being ridiculed and persecuted by the Jews who didn't believe in Jesus the Messiah. Most of the book of Hebrews tells them how Christ is greater than the sacrificial system. Here the writer drives home the point of his lengthy argument; it may be necessary to leave the \"camp\" and suffer with Christ. To be outside the camp meant to be unclean--in the days of the Exodus, those who were ceremonially unclean had to stay out side the camp. But Jesus suffered humiliation and uncleanness outside the Jerusalem gates on their behalf. The Time had come for Jewish Christians to declare their loyalty to Christ above any other loyalty, to choose to follow the Messiah whatever suffering, that might entail. They needed to move out side the safe confinement of their past, their traditions, and their ceremonies to live for Christ. What has been holding you back from complete loyalty to Jesus Christ.",
