To be outside the camp meant to be unclean--in the days of the Exodus, those who were ceremonially unclean had to stay out side the camp. But Jesus suffered humiliation and uncleanness outside the Jerusalem gates on their behalf. The Time had come for Jewish Christians to declare their loyalty to Christ above any other loyalty, to choose to follow the Messiah whatever suffering, that might entail. They needed to move out side the safe confinement of their past, their traditions, and their ceremonies to live for Christ. What has been holding you back from complete loyalty to Jesus Christ.",

But Jesus suffered humiliation and uncleanness\noutside the Jerusalem gates on their behalf...\n\nThe Time had come for Jewish Christians to declare their loyalty\nto Christ above any other loyalty, to choose to follow the Messiah\nwhatever suffering, that might entail...\n\nThey needed to move out side the safe confinement of their past,\ntheir traditions, and their ceremonies to live for Christ...\n\nWhat has been holding you back from complete loyalty to Jesus Christ.\n\nOur Prayer for Today:\nThank You Lord for the sacrifice You made on my behalf\nthat I might inherit eternal life. I pray that I would forever\nremain faithful to You. Bless my e-mail friends with good\nhealth and safety...Amen.\n\nKeep looking up, to the Son!!!\nYou're in the prayers of two who care...\nPastor Al & Marcie Sather",

    "verse": "The Jewish Christians because of their witness to the Messiah, no longer worshiped with other Jews, they were to consider their praise and acts of service their sacrifice--ones which they could offer anywhere at anytime. This probably reminded them of the prophet Hosea's words.\"Forgive all our sins and graciously receive us, so that we may offer you the sacrifice of praise.\" (Hosea 14:2)",
    "reflection": " A \"sacrifice of praise\" today would include thanking Christ for His sacrifice on the cross and telling others about it. Acts of kindness and sharing are particularly pleasing to God, even when they go unnoticed by others.",
