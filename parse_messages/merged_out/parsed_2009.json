But Jesus\n\ndid not directly answer their question because the\n\namount of faith is not as important as its genuineness. *What is faith?*\n\n*It is complete trust and loyalty to God that results in a willingness to\ndo His **will. ** Faith *is not* something we\n\nuse to put on a show for others. It is a complete and humble obedience to\nGod’s will, readiness to do what-\n\never He calls us to do. This amount of faith is not as important as the\nright kind of faith—*Faith in our all-powerful God.*\n\n*Pastor Sather*\n",
