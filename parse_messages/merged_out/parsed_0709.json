So you should consider yourselves dead to sin and able\nto live for the glory of God through Christ Jesus...\n\nWhat Paul is saying is that we should regard our old sinful nature\nas dead and unresponsive to sin~~that is if we identify ourselves \nwith Christ...\n\nIf and when we started a new life in Christ, the Holy Spirit is there\nto help us become all Christ wants us to be...\n\nOur Prayer for Today:\nDear Heavenly Father, I do confess that my greatest wish\nis to become more like Christ, however, the old nature keeps\ncreeping back.

It is the same for a new believer, he or she gains all the privileges and responsibilities of a child in God's family. One of these outstanding privileges is being led by the Spirit (see Galatians 4:5, 6). We may not always feel like we belong to God, but the Holy Spirit is our witness.
