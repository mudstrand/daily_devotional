Help us to live with a heavenly perspective, not being weighed down by the cares and possessions of this world. May we hold loosely to the things of this life, keeping our focus on serving You and doing Your will. Guide us, Lord, to simplify our lives and manage our earthly responsibilities with wisdom, so that we may be unhindered in our devotion to You. In Jesus' name, Amen.",
    "reading": "Matthew 6:33",
    "reflection": "Paul urges believers not to regard marriage, home, or financial security as the ultimate goals of life. As much as possible, we should live unhindered by the cares of this world, not getting involved with burdensome mortgages, budgets, investments, or debts that might keep us from doing God's work. A married man or woman, as Paul points out (7:33, 34), must take care of earthly responsibilities but make every effort to keep them modest and manageable. Ask Jesus to show you if there are possessions or activities that distract you.",
