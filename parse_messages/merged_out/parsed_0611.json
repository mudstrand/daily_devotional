    "verse": "Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance. So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, \"They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put Him!\" So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb. Both were running, but the other disciple out ran Peter and reached the tomb first. He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but didn't go in. Then Simon Peter, who was behind him, arrived and went into the tomb, he saw the strips of linen lying there, as well as the burial cloth that had been around Jesus' head. The cloth was folded up by itself, separate from the linen. Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed. (John 20:1-8)",

Some people who hear about the Resurrection for the first time often need time to comprehend the amazing story. often due to our daily walking in the world we become accustomed to seeing before believing.

So the question that stands before us today is, \"Do you have faith?\"",

So the other disciples told him, \"We have seen the Lord!\"\n\nBut he told them, \"Unless I see the nail marks in His hands and put my finger\nwhere the nails were, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe it.\" (Jn 20:24, 25)\n\nOur Thought for Today:\n\nHave you ever wished you could actually see Jesus, touch Him, and hear His words?\n\nAre there times you would like to sit down with Him and get His advice?\n\nThomas wanted Jesus' physical presence. But God's plan is wiser. He has not limited\nHimself to one physical body; He wants to be present with you at all times...\n\nEven now He is with you in the form of the Holy Spirit...\n\nYou can talk to Him, and you can find His words to you in the pages of the Bible.\nHe can be as real to you as He was to Thomas...\n\nOur Prayer for Today:\n\nDear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the avenue of prayer and that the line is \nalways open. I thank You that You know our needs before we even open our\nmouth. But I truly have to confess, that there are times when it would be really\nnice to talk to someone with skin on...Bless and protect our service men, and \nbe with their families...Give wisdom to our countries leaders...Amen.\n\nKeep looking up, He is waiting to hear from you...\nYou're in the prayers of two who care...\nPastor Al & Marcie Sather",
