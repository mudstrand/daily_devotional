Three times Jesus asked Peter if he loved \nHim...When Peter answered yes, Jesus told him to feed His sheep...\n\nIt is one thing to say you love Jesus, but the real test is a willingness to serve Him...\n\nPeter had repented, and here Jesus was asking him to commit his life. Peter's life \nchanged when he finally realized who Jesus was. \n\nHis occupation changed from fisherman to evangelist; his denial changed from \nimpetuous to \"rock' and his relationship to Jesus changed--he was forgiven and \nhe finally understood the significance of Jesus' words about His death and resurrection.\n\nHow would you respond if Jesus asked you, \"Do you love Me?\" Do you really love\nJesus?
