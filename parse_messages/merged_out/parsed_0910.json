Like a master carpenter, God uses the sandpaper of trouble to bring out the grain in our faith. Far better than the question \"Why falling rocks?\" is \"What should I do when rocks fall?\" \"Cry to the Lord, \" the psalmist tells me. And he even tells me where to start ~ with my sins. Lets not misunderstand. He is not saying that troubles come because of our sins. That would sure leave me comfortless as a rock-bruised believer.

    "original_reflection_text": "How often have we passed up a sign which said, \"Historical marker ahead.\"? Rather than speeding by maybe we should stop and read what the marker has to say ~ The few that I have taken the time to stop for, I've learned much about the past. If I were to set up a sign on the road of my life, what would it say? Like the Ebeneezer stone Samuel put up for Israel, would it detail what the Lord has done to save me? God had blessed the Israelites beyond measure, but success had fogged their minds. They forgot the Lord, blasphemed His house, and lost His Word in the dust of neglect ~ until that day at Mispah when the enemy army surrounded them. Finally the Israelites realized how far they had strayed. Penitently they confessed, \"We have sinned against the Lord.\" In answer, the Lord crushed the enemy and assured the Israelites of forgiveness. Up went their Ebeneezer stone for all who passed by to read, \"Thus far has the Lord helped us, \" forgiving our sins. So I have thought what would my Ebeneezer stone say? Wouldn't it be something about victory in the greatest battle of all? How God through Christ has given me victory over sin, death and the devil? Looking at Jesus' filled cross and emptied tomb, wouldn't I want my stone to say, \"Thus far the Lord has helped me, forgiving my sins?\"",

As the bodies of the Egyptian soldiers wash ashore, the Israelites sang. Let out of Egypt by the Lord, they had camped, rejoicing beside the Red Sea. Of course we know it wasn't long before their balloon of joy popped. Pharaoh's troops had been right behind them. The situation looked hopeless till the Lord led them to safety through the dammed up waters of the sea. Those walls of water became a weapon wiping out Egypt's strike force.

    "original_reflection_text": "\"My how you have grown.\" Remember how embarrassed you felt when some aunt at a family gathering would make that comment? \"Yes, \" mom would say, \"I just can't keep him in jeans.\" Yes there has come a time when I stopped growing, except around the middle where I don't want it. In one area, though, I'm never done growing. I can never learn to much about the \"Knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\" \"Knowledge\" is my understanding of the Bible's truths. I hadn't learned it all when I finished catechism class. I didn't even understand fully what I had learned. Now as an adult I ask different questions and need fuller answers. I also need to keep growing in \"the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\" Grace refers to undeserved gifts from a loving God. What could be more undeserving than His gift of salvation in Jesus? He prepared that gift for an undeserving world. That's salvation in general. He prepared that gift for me. That's salvation in particular. Until my life ends, I need to grow in appreciating His grace. How can I grow? My body does so through regular feeding. So does my soul. I need a steady diet of God's Word if I'm to keep growing in the knowledge and grace of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.",
