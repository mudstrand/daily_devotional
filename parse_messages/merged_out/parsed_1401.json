It doesn't make much difference what number we write for the year. Thank God one thing never changes. Would we want a Lord who changes His mind and issues a recall for promises He made yesterday? A Lord who forgets His full payment for all our sins and now demands that we cover sin's debt? A Lord who closes the door to heaven He once opened with His resurrection? More of the same!
