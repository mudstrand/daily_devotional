Now to feel small Is a healthy way to get back to reality, but God does not want us to dwell on our smallness. Remember this, humility means proper respect for God, not self-depreciation. The next time you question your worth as a person, remember that God considers you highly valuable. We have great worth because we bear the stamp of the Creator. Remember God considered us so valuable that He sacrificed His own Son so that the debt for our sins was paid in full. .",
