Heavenly Father, we come before you with grateful hearts, seeking your comfort and healing for your people. As your servants minister to the ailing and failing, grant them the wisdom and strength to proclaim the forgiveness found in Christ, the Lamb of God. We ask that the elders and deacons of the church would faithfully lift up the sick in prayer, that they may be restored and renewed by your grace. May all members of the communion of saints offer words of hope and cheer to our brothers and sisters in need, that we may be strengthened and encouraged in our faith. We trust in your unfailing love and mercy. Amen.
