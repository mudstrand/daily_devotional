Heavenly Father, we thank You for the example of Your Son, Jesus Christ, who, though He was rich, yet for our sake became poor, that we through His poverty might become rich (2 Corinthians 8:9). Help us to have the same mindset as Christ, who emptied Himself and took on the form of a servant, humbling Himself to the point of death on a cross (Philippians 2:5-8). May we find our true wealth and satisfaction in the riches of Your grace and not be entangled by the fleeting pleasures and possessions of this world. Amen.
