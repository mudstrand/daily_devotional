Gracious Heavenly Father, we give thanks for Your boundless kindness and compassion towards us. Help us to follow the example of Your Son, who was gentle and humble in heart, and to extend that same kindness and forgiveness to one another. May our words and actions reflect Your love, that the deaf may hear and the blind may see Your goodness at work in our lives. We pray this in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.
