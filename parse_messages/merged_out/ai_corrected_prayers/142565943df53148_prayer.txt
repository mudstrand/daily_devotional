Heavenly Father, we give thanks for your steadfast love and protection, even when we are surrounded by enemies. Your provision and guidance are a constant comfort, leading us through the darkest valleys. We look forward to the day when we will dwell in your house, where a place has been prepared for us, to enjoy your presence forever. May we trust in your promises and find rest in your care. Amen.
