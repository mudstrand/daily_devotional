Heavenly Father, we thank You for the encouragement found in the Book of Hebrews. Help us to fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith. May we lay aside every weight and sin that so easily entangles us and run with endurance the race set before us. Keep our hearts centered on Christ, the superior and sufficient Savior. In His name we pray, Amen.
