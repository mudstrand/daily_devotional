Heavenly Father, we give thanks for the promise of triumph over sin and death through the power of Your Son, Jesus Christ. Help us to embrace the cost of being identified with Christ, that we may also share in His glory as Your heirs and co-heirs. May we endure any sufferings in this world, knowing that the glory to come far outweighs our present trials. We cling to the hope of the restoration of all things, when creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay. Lord, strengthen our faith and grant us perseverance, that we may reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ. Amen.
