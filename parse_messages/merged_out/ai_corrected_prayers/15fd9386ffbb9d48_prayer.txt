Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, acknowledging that faith is the bridge that connects us to Your Son, Jesus Christ. We thank You for the good news that we have heard, the Word that has stirred our souls and led us to put our trust in You. Lord, help us to be faithful messengers, that others may hear the gospel and be drawn to the saving knowledge of Christ. May our lives be a reflection of Your love, that we may point the way to the One who is the source of all life and hope. In Your Son's name, we pray. Amen.
