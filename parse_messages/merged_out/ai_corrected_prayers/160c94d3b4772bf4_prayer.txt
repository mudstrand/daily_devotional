Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, seeking to align our lives with Your perfect will. Help us to put to death the sinful desires that so easily entangle us—anger, wrath, malice, slander, and abusive language. Cleanse us from these vices, that we may clothe ourselves in the new self, renewed in knowledge after the image of our Creator. May our lives be a reflection of Your love and grace. Amen.
