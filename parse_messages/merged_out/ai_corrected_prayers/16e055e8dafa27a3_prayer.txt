Heavenly Father, we are grateful for the gift of Your Son, Jesus, who took on a true human nature and experienced the weariness and trials that we face. Thank you that we have a Savior who can sympathize with our weaknesses, having been tempted in every way, yet without sin. May we find comfort and strength in Your Son's example, and may we trust in Your unfailing love and care for us, even in the midst of life's storms. Amen.
