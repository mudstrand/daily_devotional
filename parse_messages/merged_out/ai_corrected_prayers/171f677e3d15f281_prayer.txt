Heavenly Father, we come before you with grateful hearts, for your love has cast out all fear. Help us to dwell in your perfect love, which surpasses all understanding. May we find our security and confidence in the knowledge that nothing can separate us from your unfailing love. Lord, empower us to love others as you have loved us, that we may be a reflection of your compassion and grace. We trust in your steadfast love, now and forever. Amen.
