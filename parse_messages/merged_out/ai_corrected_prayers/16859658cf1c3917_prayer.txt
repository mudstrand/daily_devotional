Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, seeking Your wisdom and guidance. Help us to trust in You with all our hearts and not lean on our own understanding. May we acknowledge You in all our ways, that You may direct our paths. Give us the discernment to walk according to Your statutes and not to play with fire that can consume us. Grant us the patience to wait upon Your perfect timing, for Your ways are not arbitrary but filled with love and purpose. In Jesus' name, Amen.
