Heavenly Father, we come before You, acknowledging that temptation is a reality we face in this fallen world. Help us to understand that You do not tempt us, but rather, You allow trials to refine our faith and deepen our dependence on You. Grant us the wisdom to resist the devil's schemes and the strength to choose obedience to Your Word. May we not be quick to blame You for our own foolishness, but instead, turn to You as the source of our salvation. In Your name, we pray. Amen.
