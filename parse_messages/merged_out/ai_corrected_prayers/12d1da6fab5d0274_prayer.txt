Heavenly Father, we thank You for the good news of Your Son, Jesus Christ. Like the shepherds, may we eagerly seek to see and experience the truth of who You are for ourselves. Open our eyes to behold the glory of the Christ child, and fill our hearts with wonder at Your great love. May we joyfully proclaim the truth we have seen and heard, that others may come and see as well. In Jesus' name, Amen.
