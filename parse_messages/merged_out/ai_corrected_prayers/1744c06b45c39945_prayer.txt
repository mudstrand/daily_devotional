Heavenly Father, we come to you, the Good Shepherd, weary and in need of your restoration. Renew our strength and focus our hearts on you, the source of living water. Replenish our souls, that we may wake refreshed, comforted by your abiding love. Fill us with your perfect peace, Lord, that we may dwell securely in your presence. Amen.
