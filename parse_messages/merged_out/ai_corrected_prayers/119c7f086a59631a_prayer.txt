Heavenly Father, we give thanks for the gift of Your Holy Spirit, which dwells within us and is the guarantee of our eternal inheritance (Ephesians 1:13, 14). May this truth fill our hearts with unwavering hope, even as we groan inwardly, longing for the day when we will be clothed with our heavenly dwelling (2 Corinthians 5:4, 5). Grant us the courage and patience to endure all things, knowing that our eternal home awaits. In Your Son's name, we pray. Amen.
