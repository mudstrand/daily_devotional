Heavenly Father, we come before You, grateful for the gift of Your Holy Spirit. May the fruit of the Spirit—love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control—be evident in our lives. Help us to abide in Christ, that we may walk in the light and bear the fruit that pleases You. Guide us to know You more, love You deeper, and imitate Your Son, that we may fulfill the law of love. In Your name, we pray. Amen.
