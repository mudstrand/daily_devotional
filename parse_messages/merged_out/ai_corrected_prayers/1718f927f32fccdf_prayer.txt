Heavenly Father, we come before you, seeking the quiet solitude that you so often modeled for us. Amidst the clamor of the world and the demands on our time, we long to withdraw and be alone with you, to be strengthened by your presence and to find our rest in you. Grant us the discipline to make time for prayer, that we may be renewed and empowered to serve you faithfully. In your Son's name, we pray. Amen.
