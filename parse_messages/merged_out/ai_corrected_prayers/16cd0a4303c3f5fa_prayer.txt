Heavenly Father, we come before you, acknowledging that without you, our efforts are in vain. Help us to make you the foundation of our lives, our families, and our communities. May we not rely on our own strength, but instead, trust in your guidance and provision. Grant us the wisdom to seek your will and the courage to follow it, that our lives may bear the fruit of your eternal purpose. In your name, we pray. Amen.
