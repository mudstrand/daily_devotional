Heavenly Father, we praise You for the wisdom and discernment You offer through Your Word. Help us to walk the path of righteousness, turning away from the ways of the wicked. Though we may face troubles and trials, we trust that You will rescue us from the traps of sin and death. Grant us the strength to persevere and the courage to stand firm in Your truth. May our lives be a reflection of Your goodness and grace. Amen.
