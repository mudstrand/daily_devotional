Heavenly Father, we come before You, acknowledging that our hearts can so easily be drawn away from the things that truly matter. Help us to set our minds on the things above, not on the things of this world. May Your kingdom and Your righteousness be our primary concern, as we trust in Your provision and seek to honor You in all we do. Guide us, Lord, to keep our focus on the eternal, that we may walk in a manner worthy of You. Amen.
