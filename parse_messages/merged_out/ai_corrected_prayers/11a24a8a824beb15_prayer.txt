Heavenly Father, we thank You for the example of the Apostle Paul, who remained steadfast in his faith despite facing hardships and persecution. Help us, like him, to stand firm in Your truth and not be swayed by the shifting opinions of the world. Grant us the strength and courage to wield the spiritual armor You have provided, that we may withstand the schemes of the devil and remain faithful to You. May our lives be a testament to Your goodness and grace, even in the midst of life's difficulties. In Jesus' name, Amen.
