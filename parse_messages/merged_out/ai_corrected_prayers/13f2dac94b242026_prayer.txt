Heavenly Father, we give thanks that You have kept us here on earth, not for our own sake, but to live for You and to bring others to know Your love. Help us to be faithful sowers, plowmen, and heralds, that we may glorify Christ in our daily lives and work together with You for the salvation of the world. Until the day when we are called home to be with You, may our lives answer the purpose for which You have kept us here. Amen.
