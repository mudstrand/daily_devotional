Heavenly Father, we come before you seeking your wisdom and understanding. Help us to examine our hearts and actions, that we may walk in the way of true wisdom. May our words and deeds reflect the peace, gentleness, and goodness that come from you. Empower us to be peacemakers, sowing seeds of unity and reconciliation, rather than fueling discord. Guide us, Lord, that we may live in a manner worthy of your calling. Amen.
