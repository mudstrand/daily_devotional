Heavenly Father, we give thanks for the living hope You have given us through the resurrection of Your Son, Jesus Christ. We rejoice in the inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, which You have reserved in heaven for us. In the midst of trials and tribulations, may we cling to the promise of eternal life and the assurance that our final destination will be life with You. Guide us by Your Spirit to walk worthy of this glorious inheritance. Amen.
