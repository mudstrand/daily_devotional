Heavenly Father, we give thanks for your mighty deeds and your eternal promises. Though we may be tempted to focus only on our present troubles, help us to keep our eyes fixed on the glorious future you have prepared for us in the new heavens and the new earth. May the song of Moses and the Lamb ever be on our lips, as we rejoice in the victory won by your Son, our Savior. Amen.
