Heavenly Father, we humbly come before You, acknowledging that our unrighteousness can never commend Your perfect righteousness. Help us to shun any distortion of Your Word and instead recognize that Your judgment is righteous and just. May we tremble at the thought of Your divine judgment against all ungodliness and wickedness. Grant us the grace to live in reverence of Your sovereign authority as the Judge over all the earth. In Your name, we pray. Amen.
