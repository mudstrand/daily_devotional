Heavenly Father, we stand in awe of Your Son, Jesus, who resolutely set out for Jerusalem, knowing the suffering that awaited Him. His love for sinners like us compelled Him to the cross, where He poured out His life-blood to save us from our sins. We are humbled by the depth of His sacrifice and the unwavering determination of His heart. May we be inspired by His example to follow You with the same resolute spirit, trusting in Your perfect plan, even when the path is difficult. We give thanks for Your great love, Lord. Amen.
