Heavenly Father, we come before You in the midst of the storms that rage within our souls. Like the disciples in the boat, we are tossed by the waves of sin and fear, longing for Your calming presence. Lord, we trust in Your sovereignty and power to still the tempests that threaten to overwhelm us. Strengthen our faith, that we may approach You with confidence, knowing that You are our Savior, the Sovereign of our lives. Deliver us from all our faults, and fill us with the peace that only You can provide. Amen.
