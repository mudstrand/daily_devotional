Heavenly Father, we praise You for the power and life that Jesus Christ offers to all who believe in Him. Thank You for the assurance that death cannot conquer those who have faith in the One who is the Resurrection and the Life. Lord, may we cling to the promise that in You, we will live again, even when our earthly bodies fail. We commit our lives to You, the Giver of eternal life. Amen.
