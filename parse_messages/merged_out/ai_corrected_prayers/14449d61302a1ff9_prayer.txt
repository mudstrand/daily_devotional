Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, humbled by the example of Your Son, Jesus, who found joy in doing Your will. Help us to follow in His footsteps, to proclaim the Good News of Your righteousness and forgiveness, and to be ever-ready to witness to those around us. May we not make excuses, but instead, see the continual harvest that waits to be gathered and boldly share Your Word. Guide us, Lord, to be faithful servants who delight in doing Your will. Amen.
