Heavenly Father, we give thanks for the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ. Stir our hearts to share this message with those who have not yet heard, that they may come to believe and be saved. Grant us courage and wisdom to proclaim your truth, that more may know the hope found in you. Use us as your instruments to bring the light of the gospel to our loved ones and neighbors. In your Son's name, we pray. Amen.
