Heavenly Father, we come before You, seeking Your strength and guidance as we navigate the spiritual battles we face. Grant us the wisdom and discernment to recognize the schemes of the enemy and the courage to stand firm in our faith, clinging to the promise of victory that is ours through Christ. May we persevere in righteousness, living as those who follow You, that we may receive the great rewards You have prepared for us. In Your mighty name, we pray. Amen.
