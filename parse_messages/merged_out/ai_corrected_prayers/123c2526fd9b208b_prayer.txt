Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, acknowledging the weight of our sins that have shattered our relationship with You. Yet, we are grateful for the gift of Your Son, Jesus Christ, who serves as our Mediator, speaking on our behalf and securing our forgiveness. Through Him, we can approach You with confidence, calling You "Father," and finding peace and restoration in Your presence. May we always cherish this precious gift of grace. Amen.
