Heavenly Father, we come to you with grateful hearts, knowing that you are ever-present and eager to hear our prayers. As your Word declares, we ask, seek, and knock, trusting that you will answer and provide for us according to your perfect will. Open our eyes to recognize your blessings, even when they come in unexpected ways. Grant us the faith to believe that you will always work for our good and your glory. In Jesus' name, Amen.
