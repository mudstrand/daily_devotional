Heavenly Father, we come before you with grateful hearts, seeking to know you more deeply. Help us to walk in obedience to your commands, that our actions may reflect the love of Christ. May our lives be a testament to the faith we profess, that we may have the assurance of belonging to you. Guide us, Lord, to love one another as you have loved us. In Jesus' name, Amen.
