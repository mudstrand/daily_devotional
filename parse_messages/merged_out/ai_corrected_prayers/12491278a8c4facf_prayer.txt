Heavenly Father, we give thanks for Your steadfast love and faithfulness. You have been our Ebenezer, our help and salvation, time and again. Forgive us when we have strayed from You, neglecting Your Word and forgetting Your blessings. May our lives be a testament to Your power to redeem and restore, that all who pass by may see the victory You have won for us through Christ. Thus far, O Lord, You have helped us. Amen.
