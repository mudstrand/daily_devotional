Heavenly Father, we come before you, acknowledging that our true security and safety can only be found in you, the eternal and all-powerful God. Help us not to put our trust in the fleeting and uncertain wealth of this world, but to find our refuge in the strong tower of your name. May we ever seek to abide in your presence, for you alone are our ever-present help in times of trouble. We give thanks for your unfailing love and faithfulness. Amen.
