Heavenly Father, we give thanks for the gift of family and the wisdom You have imparted to us through the words of Scripture. Help us to not merely obey our parents, but to truly honor them with reverence and love, recognizing the blessing they are in our lives. May we heed the instruction of Your Word and wear the adornment of honor as a crown of splendor. We ask this in the name of Your Son, Jesus Christ. Amen.
