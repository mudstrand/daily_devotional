Heavenly Father, we thank You for the sacrifice of Your Son, Jesus Christ, who died for us while we were still sinners. We praise You for His victory over sin and death, and for the gift of the Holy Spirit, who convicts the world of its sin, reveals Your righteousness, and demonstrates the judgment over Satan. May we humbly receive the Spirit's work in our lives and turn to You in repentance and faith. In Jesus' name, Amen.
