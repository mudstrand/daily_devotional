Heavenly Father, we praise You for the new birth into a living hope that we have through the resurrection of Jesus Christ (1 Peter 1:3). Thank you for granting us peace with You and access by faith into Your grace, in which we now stand (Romans 5:1-2). Even in the midst of trials and tribulations, we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God, for our eternal life has already begun through our trust in Christ. May we hold fast to this wonderful expectation, Lord. Amen.
