Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, acknowledging that our future is in Your loving hands. Help us to trust in You with all our hearts and not lean on our own understanding. Guide us in Your paths, for we know that You will make our ways straight. May we find strength and peace in the knowledge that our lives are secure under Your watchful care. We surrender ourselves to Your perfect will, O Lord. Amen.
