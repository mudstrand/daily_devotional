Heavenly Father, we are humbled by the sobering truth that the wages of sin are death, yet Your grace offers eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Forgive us for the times we have turned away from Your light, leaving ourselves vulnerable to the overwhelming powers of evil. Grant us the wisdom and strength to always give You the glory that is due, that we may walk in obedience to Your will and find true life in Your presence. Amen.
