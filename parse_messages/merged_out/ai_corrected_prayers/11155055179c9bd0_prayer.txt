Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, acknowledging the gravity of rejecting Your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and the salvation He offers. Help us to heed the warning in Hebrews 10:26 that there is no other sacrifice for sin than the precious blood of Christ. May we never turn away from the Good News of Your saving love, but instead cling to the truth that eternal life is found in Christ alone. Guide us by Your Holy Spirit that we may walk faithfully in the light of Your Word. Amen.
