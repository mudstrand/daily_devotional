Heavenly Father, we come before You, acknowledging that we are all members of Your body, the Church. Help us to humbly and gently care for one another, correcting and encouraging those who need it, just as You have commanded us. May we never think ourselves independent or excused from the task of serving our brothers and sisters. Instead, let us work together for the common good, bearing one another's burdens and fulfilling the law of Christ. In Your name, we pray. Amen.
