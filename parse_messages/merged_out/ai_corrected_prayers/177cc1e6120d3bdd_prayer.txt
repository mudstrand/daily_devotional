Heavenly Father, we give thanks for your relentless pursuit of the lost, for your joy in the recovery of a single soul. May we share in your delight when the prodigal returns home, remembering that each person is of infinite value, redeemed by the blood of your Son. Grant us wisdom and compassion to seek the wandering, that we may join in the celebration when the lost are found. Amen.
