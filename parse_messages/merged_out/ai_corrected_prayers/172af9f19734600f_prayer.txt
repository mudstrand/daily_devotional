Heavenly Father, we come before You with hearts that sometimes waver in the face of life's storms. Like Peter, we are often afraid, and our faith falters. Yet, we know that You are the only one who can truly help us in our time of need. Help us to keep our eyes fixed on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, and to reach out to Him when our courage fails. May we never lose sight of Your constant presence and unwavering power to rescue us. In Your Son's name, we pray, Amen.
