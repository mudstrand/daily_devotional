Heavenly Father, we come to you with humble hearts, seeking to know you more. As your Word in Matthew 7 instructs, we ask, seek, and knock, trusting that you will open the door and grant us the wisdom and understanding we need. Like the guidance in James 1, we ask for the wisdom to navigate the complexities of life, to grow in our faith, and to persevere in our pursuit of you. Lord, fill us with your steadfast love and unwavering presence, that we may never give up in our journey to know you more deeply. Amen.
