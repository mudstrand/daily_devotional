Heavenly Father, we praise You for the glory of Your new covenant, which surpasses the glory of the old. Though the law condemned us, it pointed us to the grace and mercy found in Your Son, Jesus Christ. By faith in His finished work, we are made righteous and given new life through the power of Your Spirit. We stand in awe of Your boundless love and the glorious freedom we have in Christ. Amen.
