Heavenly Father, we come before you with hearts longing to worship you in truth. Help us to sing with sincerity, not merely with our lips, but with the genuine affection of our souls. May our hymns and songs reflect the depth of our love and devotion to you, the one true God. Empower us by your Spirit to live out the words we sing, that our lives may glorify your name. We ask this in the precious name of Jesus. Amen.
