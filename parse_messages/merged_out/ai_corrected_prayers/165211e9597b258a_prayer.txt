Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, acknowledging that our words hold power—the power to build up or tear down. Help us, Lord, to use our speech to bring forth Your light and love, rather than to indulge in violence or treachery. May our lips speak words of life, that we may reap the bountiful harvest of Your goodness. Guide us, O God, to walk in the way of the righteous, that our lives may bear witness to Your grace. Amen.
