Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, seeking to live for Your eternal kingdom. Help us to remain steadfast in our faith, even in the face of trials and tribulations. May we be faithful unto death, that we may receive the crown of life You have promised to those who love You. Guide us, Lord, that we may not lose the reward and the crown, but instead, may we find eternal honor and glory in Your presence. Amen.
