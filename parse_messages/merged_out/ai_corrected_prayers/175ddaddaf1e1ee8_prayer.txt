Heavenly Father, we come before you with grateful hearts, for you have showered us with countless blessings. Like the one leper who returned to give thanks, may we never take your grace for granted. Help us to recognize that our faith plays a role in the miracles you perform in our lives. May our responsiveness to your goodness deepen our understanding of your love and mercy. We give you all the glory, for you alone are worthy of our praise. Amen.
