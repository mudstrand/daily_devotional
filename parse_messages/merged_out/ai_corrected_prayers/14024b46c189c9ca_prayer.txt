Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, acknowledging that Your judgment is not based on outward appearances, but on the faith and obedience that resides within us. Help us to be like the healthy, fruit-bearing trees planted by the river, with strong roots that draw nourishment from Your living waters. May we walk in the path of righteousness, guided by Your wisdom, and find eternal life in Your presence. Amen.
