Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, acknowledging our tendency to be self-centered and indifferent to the joys and sorrows of our brothers and sisters in Christ. Forgive us for the times we have been jealous of those who are honored and apathetic towards those who suffer. Help us to truly rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep, for we are all members of one body in You. May we be a people who are deeply invested in the lives of others, sharing in their triumphs and trials, and reflecting Your love and compassion to a world in need. In Your Son's name we pray, Amen.
