Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, acknowledging the depths of our sin and the need for Your cleansing. Search us, O God, and know our hearts; test us and know our anxious thoughts (Psalm 139:23-24). Reveal to us the areas where we have fallen short, that we may turn from our wicked ways and walk in obedience to Your will. Forgive us, Lord, and create in us a clean heart (Psalm 51:10). May our prayers be marked by sincerity and a desire to grow in holiness. Amen.
