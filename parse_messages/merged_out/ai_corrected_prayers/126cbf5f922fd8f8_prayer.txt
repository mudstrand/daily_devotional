Heavenly Father, we are in awe of Your unfailing love that is poured out upon us each and every day. Thank you for the countless ways You demonstrate Your care and compassion, from the support of loved ones to the strength to overcome temptation. Most of all, we are grateful for the ultimate expression of Your love - the sacrifice of Your Son, Jesus, who willingly took our place on the cross to pay the full penalty for our sin. May we live each day in grateful response to Your steadfast love. Amen.
