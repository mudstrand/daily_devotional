Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, acknowledging that Your timing is always perfect. When we grow impatient, help us to remember the example of Your Son, who came in the fullness of time to redeem us and make us Your children. Grant us the wisdom to wait upon You, trusting that in Your perfect plan, all things will be revealed in due season. Give us the patience to endure and the faith to persevere as we hope in the promises You have made. Amen.
