Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, acknowledging our inability to love You with the fullness and sincerity that You deserve. Our minds are often clouded by doubts, and our affections divided, unable to give You the complete devotion that Your perfect law demands. Lord, we pray that by Your Spirit, You would ignite in us a fervent love for You, that we may love You with all our heart, soul, and strength, and that this love would overflow into loving service for others. Forgive us for our shortcomings, and empower us to walk in obedience to Your commands. Amen.
