Heavenly Father, we give thanks for the new covenant that You have established through Your Son, Jesus Christ. We recognize that the old system of sacrifice was but a shadow of the true sacrifice to come—the perfect and final offering of Your Son on our behalf. Help us to walk in obedience to Your moral law, not out of duty, but out of a heart transformed by the power of Your Spirit living within us. May we ever seek to honor You and glorify Your name. Amen.
