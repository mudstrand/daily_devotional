Heavenly Father, we give thanks for the privilege and responsibility of being called by Your name. Forgive us for the times we have fallen short of witnessing to Your good news. Empower us by Your Spirit to live as ambassadors for Christ, fully committed to the new life You have begun in us. May our lives reflect the transformative power of the gospel, that others may come to know You as Lord. Amen.
