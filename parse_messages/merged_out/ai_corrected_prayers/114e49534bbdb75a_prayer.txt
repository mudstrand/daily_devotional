Heavenly Father, we are humbled by the choice before us—to serve sin and face eternal death, or to receive the gift of eternal life through Your Son, Jesus Christ. We acknowledge the foolishness of trying to earn or pay for Your gracious gift, and instead come before You with grateful hearts, accepting the new life You freely offer. May we always choose to walk with You, our loving Savior, and live according to Your will. Amen.
