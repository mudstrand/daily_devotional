Heavenly Father, we come before you with grateful hearts, filled with the joy of your salvation. As we reflect on the promise of your Son's reign, we lift our voices in praise, for you have turned your anger away and become our salvation. We give thanks to you, Lord, and proclaim your goodness to all the world. May our lives be a testament to the Good News, that others may know the reason for our joy. Amen.
