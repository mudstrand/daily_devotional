Heavenly Father, we come before you with grateful hearts, humbled by the privilege of being part of your eternal purpose in Christ. Thank you for revealing the mystery of your grace, that through Jesus, all people may be reconciled to you. Lord, fill us with your wisdom and understanding, that we may faithfully proclaim the good news of your love to all. May your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Amen.
