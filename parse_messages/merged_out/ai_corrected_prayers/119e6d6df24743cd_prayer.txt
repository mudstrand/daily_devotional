Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, acknowledging that all we do should be to honor and glorify Your name. May the love of Christ control our lives, as it did for the Apostle Paul, that we may no longer live for ourselves but for the One who died and rose again for our sake. Help us to present our bodies as living sacrifices, holy and acceptable to You, and to be transformed by the renewing of our minds, that we may discern Your good, pleasing, and perfect will. In Jesus' name, Amen.
