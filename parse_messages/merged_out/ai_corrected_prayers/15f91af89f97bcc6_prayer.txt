Heavenly Father, we come before you with grateful hearts, acknowledging that our thoughts and meditations should be centered on you. Help us to be ever mindful of your presence, seeking to align our lives with your will. May the peace that transcends all understanding guard our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus, as we cast our cares upon you. In the stillness of the night, may our souls find rest and rejoice in your steadfast love. Amen.
