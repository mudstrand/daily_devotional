Heavenly Father, we come to you with grateful hearts, acknowledging that you are the source of all peace and comfort. In the midst of our worries and anxieties, we cast our cares upon you, for you promise to sustain us (Psalm 55:22). Help us to rejoice in you always, as Paul instructs, and to present our requests to you with thanksgiving (Philippians 4:4-7). May we find rest in your steadfast love and the assurance that you are in control. We trust in your perfect plan for our lives. Amen.
