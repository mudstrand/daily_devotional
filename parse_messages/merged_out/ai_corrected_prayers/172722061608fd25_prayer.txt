Heavenly Father, we come before you as members of the body of Christ, united in your Son. Help us to grow in love and truth, following the lead of our Head, Jesus. May our words and actions build up the body, working together for your glory. Guide us to serve one another and the world around us, that your kingdom may come. Amen.
