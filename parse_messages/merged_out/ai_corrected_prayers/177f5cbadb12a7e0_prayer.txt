Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, acknowledging the profound truth that even the most gifted among us can stray from Your ways. Like the ox that knows its owner and the donkey its master's crib, we too often fail to recognize Your sovereignty and the abundant blessings You have bestowed upon us. Forgive us for the times we have become lost in the darkness of our own desires, and grant us the wisdom and discernment to seek Your guidance, that we may find our way back to the path of righteousness. Lord, restore our minds and our souls, that we may glorify You in all that we do. Amen.
