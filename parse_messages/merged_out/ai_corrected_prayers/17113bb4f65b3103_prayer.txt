Heavenly Father, we come before you with grateful hearts, knowing that in you we find healing and true fellowship. Help us to turn our minds and hearts towards you, the One who has made us a dwelling place for your Spirit. May we confidently put our trust in the eternal life you have promised, for in you alone do we find our true home. Guide us, Lord, to abide in your presence and to be the living stones that build your temple. Amen.
