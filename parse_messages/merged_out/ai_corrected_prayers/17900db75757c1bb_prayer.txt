Heavenly Father, we come before you, acknowledging that the idols of this world can never satisfy the deepest longings of our hearts. Help us to turn away from the false promises of earthly treasures and instead, worship and serve you, the one true God. In Jesus Christ, we have found the fulfillment and peace that no earthly possession can provide. May we always choose to serve you, the source of our salvation and the giver of eternal life. Amen.
