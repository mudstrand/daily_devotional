Heavenly Father, we come to You, the Almighty God, seeking Your protection and comfort in the midst of life's crises. Just as Psalm 91:1 promises, we find refuge under the shadow of Your wings. When we are overwhelmed by the darkness of this world, remind us to call upon Your name and abide in Your presence. May we always remember that You are our 911, our ever-present help in times of trouble. We trust in Your unfailing love and faithfulness. Amen.
