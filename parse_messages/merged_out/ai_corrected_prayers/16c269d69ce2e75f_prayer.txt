Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, acknowledging the mystery of the trials and tribulations we face in this life. Though we may not always understand the reasons behind the pain and loss we experience, we trust in Your wisdom and goodness. Lord, help us to remember that You are our Shepherd, guiding us through the ups and downs of our journey. Give us the strength to continue to put our faith in You, even when the path ahead is unclear. We give thanks that You are a God who does not forsake us, but remains faithful and true. Amen.
