Heavenly Father, we are in awe of Your servant, the Messiah, who came not with self-promotion or fanfare, but with quiet, gentle, and tender care. Help us to follow His example, to quickly and compassionately minister to the needs of others, without seeking our own glory. May we, like the Messiah, lead justice to victory, not through loud demands, but through humble service. We pray this in the name of Your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
