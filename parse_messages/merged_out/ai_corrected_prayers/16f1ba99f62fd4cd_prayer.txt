Heavenly Father, we give thanks that You have sent Your only begotten Son, the Word made flesh, to dwell among us. May the truth of Immanuel, God with us, fill our hearts with joy and inspire us to share the simple gospel story through our lives. Help us to find new ways this Christmas to demonstrate Your presence and love to all those around us. In the name of Jesus, we pray. Amen.
