Heavenly Father, we come to you in humble dependence, recognizing that true power and faith are found in prayer. Like the disciples, we face difficult circumstances that can only be resolved through reliance on you. Fill us with the strength and courage to persistently seek your will, knowing that you are able to do far more than we can ask or imagine. May our prayers demonstrate our complete trust in you, the source of all wisdom and might. Amen.
