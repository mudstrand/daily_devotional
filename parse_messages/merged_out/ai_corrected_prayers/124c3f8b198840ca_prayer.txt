Heavenly Father, we give thanks for the eternal life that You have promised to all who believe in Your Son, Jesus Christ. We rejoice that through faith in Him, we have the assurance of Your protection, the promise of a permanent home in Your heavenly kingdom, and the ability to enjoy the benefits of this wonderful life. Lord, help us to live each day in the confidence of Your salvation, resting in the knowledge that the cost has been paid in full by the sacrifice of Your Son. Amen.
