Heavenly Father, we come before You with hearts of gratitude for the promise of Your kingdom. Though our faith may feel small, we trust in Your power to grow it and use it for Your glory. Help us to remember that we are not alone, but part of a worldwide community of believers united in Your love. May our lives bear witness to the transformative work of Your Spirit, that others may be drawn to the hope found in Your Son, Jesus Christ. Amen.
