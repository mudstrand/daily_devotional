Heavenly Father, we come to You with hearts that are often troubled by the trials and tribulations of this fallen world. Yet, Your Word reminds us to cast all our anxieties upon You, for You care for us (1 Peter 5:7). Help us to trust in Your perfect plan, to find peace in Your presence, and to reflect the joy of knowing that You are in control (Philippians 4:6-7). May our faces shine with the light of Your love, and our lives be a testament to the transformative power of faith in Jesus. Amen.
