Heavenly Father, we come to You with grateful hearts, acknowledging that even in the midst of tribulations, Your Son has overcome the world. Lord, grant us the strength and courage to face the strains of life, for it is through these trials that we are made stronger. Help us to be of good cheer, even when we feel defeated, for we know that victory is possible through Jesus Christ. May we cling to the promise of the Tree of Life, and may our lives be a testament to Your faithfulness. Amen.
