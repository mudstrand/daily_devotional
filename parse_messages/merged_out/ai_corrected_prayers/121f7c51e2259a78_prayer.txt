Heavenly Father, we thank You for the profound truth that in Christ, we are dead to sin and freed from its power. Help us to live in the consciousness of our union with the crucified Christ, that the power of His life in us may make us truly free from the dominion of sin. May we grow in this understanding and experience the reality of our death to sin and life in You. Amen.
