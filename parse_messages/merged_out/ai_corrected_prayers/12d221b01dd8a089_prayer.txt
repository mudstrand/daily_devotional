Heavenly Father, we give thanks for the gift of Your Son, the Wonderful Counselor and Mighty God, who has come to deliver us from the darkness of sin and death. In Your great love and mercy, You have made us alive in Christ, that we might walk in the light of Your eternal kingdom. May we ever hold fast to the hope found in Your Son, the Prince of Peace, and worship Him as the true King of kings. Amen.
