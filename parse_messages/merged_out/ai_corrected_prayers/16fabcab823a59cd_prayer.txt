Heavenly Father, we come to You with grateful hearts, knowing that in Christ, we are a new creation. Though fear may linger, we cling to the truth that You have called us by name and have given us the power to overcome. Help us to walk in the assurance of Your love and the security of our eternal home in heaven. May we find our strength in You, the One who has conquered all. Amen.
