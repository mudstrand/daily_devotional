Heavenly Father, we stand in awe of Your great love, displayed on the cross of Jesus Christ. We are humbled that Your Son would suffer and die, taking the punishment for our sins, that we might be forgiven and reconciled to You. We rejoice that His sacrifice is sufficient to cover the sins of the whole world, including our own. May we cling to the assurance of salvation found in the cross and live each day in gratitude for Your boundless grace. Amen.
