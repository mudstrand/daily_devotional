Heavenly Father, forgive us for the times we have brought sorrow to Your Holy Spirit through our unwholesome language, bitterness, and harsh words. Help us to put away all malice and, instead, be kind, tenderhearted, and forgiving towards one another, just as You have forgiven us through Your Son, Jesus Christ. May our attitudes and actions reflect Your love and grace. Amen.
