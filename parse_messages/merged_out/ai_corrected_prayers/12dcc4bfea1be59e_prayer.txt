Heavenly Father, we come before you, seeking to follow you as our Captain, our Master, and our Trusted Counselor. Help us to walk in the light of your Word, obeying your commands and living according to the laws of your Kingdom. May we never stray into darkness, but remain steadfast in our commitment to follow Christ, the Light of the world. Guide us, Lord, that we may bring glory to your name. Amen.
