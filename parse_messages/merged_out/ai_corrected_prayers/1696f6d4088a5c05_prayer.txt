Heavenly Father, we come before you, acknowledging the challenges and obstacles that often cloud our vision and tempt us to give up. Yet, we are reminded by your Word to run with perseverance the race marked out for us, keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith. Grant us the strength and courage to press on, even when the path seems difficult, for you are with us, helping us to endure until the day we see you face to face. May we finish strong, focused on your steadfast love and unwavering guidance. Amen.
