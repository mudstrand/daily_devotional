Heavenly Father, we are grateful for the reassurance of Your watchful care over us, as Your angels encamp around those who fear You. (Psalm 34:7) When we face times of great stress and fear, we take comfort in the promise that You will answer us and be with us in our trouble. (Psalm 91:15) May we always remember that we have Your constant attention and protection. In Your Son's name, we pray, Amen.
