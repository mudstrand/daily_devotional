Heavenly Father, we come before You with hearts filled with the desire to persevere in prayer. Grant us the wisdom and the will to take the time to seek Your will for the state and the needs of the body of Christ. May Your love and the power of the Holy Spirit fill our hearts, that we may be equipped to do Your work in this sinful world. We yield ourselves to You, Lord, that Your purposes may be accomplished. Amen.
