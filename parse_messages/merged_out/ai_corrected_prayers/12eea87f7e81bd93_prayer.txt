Heavenly Father, we acknowledge that the wages of sin are death, and that we can never earn Your grace through our own good deeds. Yet, in Your great love, You sent Your Son, Jesus, to die on the cross and rise again, freeing us from the bondage of sin. We are no longer slaves, but now have the freedom to serve You, the one true God. May we live as Your redeemed children, grateful for the gift of eternal life. Amen.
