Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, acknowledging that the work of transformation in our lives is Yours alone. Like the Philippians, we trust that You who have begun a good work in us will bring it to completion. When we grow weary or discouraged, grant us patience and perseverance, that we may fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith. Empower us by Your Spirit to press on toward the goal, confident that You will complete the work You have started. Amen.
