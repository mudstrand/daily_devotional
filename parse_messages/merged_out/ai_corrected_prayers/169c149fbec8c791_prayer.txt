Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, seeking Your wisdom and guidance. Help us to not lean on our own understanding, but to acknowledge You in all our ways, that You may direct our paths. May we not be led astray by the temptations of the world, but instead find joy and fulfillment in walking according to Your precepts found in the Book of Proverbs. Lead us, O Lord, that we may avoid the snares of life and follow the way of righteousness. Amen.
