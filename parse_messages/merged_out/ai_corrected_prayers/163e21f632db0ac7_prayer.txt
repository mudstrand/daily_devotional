Gracious Heavenly Father, we come before you, acknowledging the power of our words and the need for self-control. Help us to be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry, as your servant James has taught us. May our tongues be instruments of life, not death, that we may honor you and build up one another. Guide us to pause and reflect before we react, that our words may be seasoned with wisdom and grace. In your Son's name, we pray. Amen.
