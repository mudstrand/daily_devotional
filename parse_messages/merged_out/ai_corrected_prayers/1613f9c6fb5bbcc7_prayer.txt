Heavenly Father, we come before you with grateful hearts for the opportunity to partner with those who faithfully proclaim your gospel. May we be generous in our support, both financially and through our prayers, that your message may continue to spread and transform lives. Guide us, Lord, to be faithful stewards of the resources you have entrusted to us, that we may glorify your name. Amen.
