Heavenly Father, we come before You, seeking to honor and serve You above all else. Help us to set aside our own desires and willfulness, that we may build up and encourage our neighbors with our words and actions. May we not be people-pleasers, but rather servants of Christ, seeking to please You and to love others as You have loved us. Guide us by Your Spirit, that our convictions may be rooted in Your truth and our hearts may be softened toward those around us. In Jesus' name, Amen.
