Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, acknowledging that all we have is a gift from Your hand. Help us to have a right perspective on our possessions, understanding that they are not ours to hoard but to use for the benefit of others. Give us the courage to give freely of our time, talents, and resources, knowing that when we do, You will supply us with more so that we may continue to bless those around us. May our generosity reflect Your own generous heart, and may it bring glory to Your name. Amen.
