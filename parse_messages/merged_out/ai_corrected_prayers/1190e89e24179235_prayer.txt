Heavenly Father, we come before You, acknowledging the limitations and disabilities that we or our loved ones may face. Yet, we find hope in Your promise of a new, glorified body when Christ returns. Help us to see beyond our present struggles and cling to the assurance that our earthly afflictions are temporary, and that one day, we will be freed from all that binds us. May we walk in Your love, hear Your good news, and live as Your redeemed children. In Your Son's name, we pray. Amen.
