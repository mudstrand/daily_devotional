Heavenly Father, we thank You for the gift of Your unending grace and mercy. Just as the Apostle Paul felt a deep obligation to share the good news of Your Son's redemption, may we too be compelled by Your love to proclaim the Gospel to all people. Stir in our hearts a fervent passion to see the lost come to know the transforming power of Your salvation. May we be bold witnesses of Your truth and grace. Amen.
