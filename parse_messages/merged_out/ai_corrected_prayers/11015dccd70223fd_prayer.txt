Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, acknowledging the deceitfulness of sin and the danger of unbelief. Grant us new hearts, new desires, and new spirits, that we may cling to You, the living God, and walk in obedience to Your ways. May we encourage one another daily in the faith, spurring one another on toward love and good deeds. Keep us from hardening our hearts, and help us to remain steadfast in our trust in You. Amen.
