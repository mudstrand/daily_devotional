Heavenly Father, we thank You for the example of Timothy, who, despite his youth, lived with integrity and godliness, earning the respect of those around him. Lord, help us, too, to be examples of Your love and grace, regardless of our age or stage in life. May our speech, our actions, and our very lives reflect the transforming power of Your Spirit within us. Use us, Lord, to point others to the hope and salvation found in Jesus Christ. Amen.
