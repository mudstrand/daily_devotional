Heavenly Father, we give thanks for the new commandment of love that You have revealed to us through Your Son, Jesus Christ. May the light of His gospel shine brightly in our hearts, dispelling the darkness of this world and empowering us to love one another as You have loved us. Help us to be Your beloved children, born of God, that we may reflect Your love to all. In Jesus' name, Amen.
