Heavenly Father, we come before You, weary and worn from the trials of this world. Yet, we are reminded of Your promise in 2 Corinthians 4:16 that though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. Lord, we pray that by the power of Your Holy Spirit, as described in Ephesians 3, You would strengthen us from within, that Christ may dwell in our hearts through faith. Grant us the courage to persevere, even when the pain and criticism seem overwhelming. May Your resurrection power sustain us, moment by moment, as we seek to serve You faithfully. Amen.
