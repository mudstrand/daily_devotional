Heavenly Father, we praise You for Your perfect timing and sovereign plan. Though we may not understand the trials and tribulations we face, we trust that You work all things together for the good of those who love You (Romans 8:28). In Your perfect time, You sent Your Son to redeem us from sin and death (Galatians 4:4, 5). Help us to wait patiently for Your timing, knowing that Your judgments are wise and Your love is unfailing. May we never doubt Your goodness or give up hope in Your perfect plan. Amen.
