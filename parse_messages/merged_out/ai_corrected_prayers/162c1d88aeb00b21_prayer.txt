Heavenly Father, we give thanks for the treasure of Your Word, which You have graciously entrusted to us. Help us to hide Your commands in our hearts, that we may not sin against You. May our love for Your law be our delight, and may we walk in the way of Your statutes, for in keeping them there is great reward. Guide us by Your Spirit, that we may fear, love, and trust in You with all our heart. Amen.
