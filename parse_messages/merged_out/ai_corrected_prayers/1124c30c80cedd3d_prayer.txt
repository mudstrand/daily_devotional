Gracious Heavenly Father, we lift up our Christian leaders before you, for they are in great need of your protection and guidance. Grant them boldness to proclaim the gospel, even in the face of opposition. Strengthen their faith and keep them humble, that they may faithfully serve you and your people. May their lives and ministries be a testimony to your power and love. We ask this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
