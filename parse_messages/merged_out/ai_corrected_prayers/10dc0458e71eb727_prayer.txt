Heavenly Father, we thank You for the gift of joy that transcends our ever-changing circumstances. Help us to remain steadfast in our relationship with Your Son, Jesus Christ, that we may walk through both prosperity and adversity with a level-headed spirit, rejoicing always in Your constant love and presence. May our lives be intertwined with Yours, that we may experience the true and lasting joy that comes from abiding in You. Amen.
