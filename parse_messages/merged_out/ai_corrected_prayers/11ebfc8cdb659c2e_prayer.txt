Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, seeking the courage to face the challenges in our lives and relationships. Give us the strength to have difficult conversations, to fight for the growth of our marriages, families, and friendships. May we not shrink back in fear but stand firm in Your truth, trusting that You are with us. Lord, empower us to be bold and courageous, that we may bring glory to Your name. Amen.
