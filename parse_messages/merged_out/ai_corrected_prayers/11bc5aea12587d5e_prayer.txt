Heavenly Father, we come before You, seeking to walk in the Spirit and not gratify the desires of the flesh. Help us to discern Your leading, that our desires may align with the fruit of the Spirit—love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. May we crucify our sinful nature and live by the Spirit, keeping in step with Your will. Guide us, Lord, that we may honor You in all we do. Amen.
