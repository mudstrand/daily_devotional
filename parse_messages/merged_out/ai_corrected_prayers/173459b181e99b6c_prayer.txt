Heavenly Father, we recognize the urgency of the times in which we live. As the last days continue until Your Son's return, grant us wisdom to make the most of the time You have given us. May we walk carefully, not as unwise but as wise, redeeming the time, for the days are evil. Help us to discern the signs of the times and to live with diligence, purpose, and faithfulness, that we may bring glory to Your name. In Jesus' name, Amen.
