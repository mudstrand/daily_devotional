Heavenly Father, we come before you with grateful hearts, acknowledging that all we have is a gift from your gracious hand. Help us to honor you with our possessions and our talents, using them to bring glory to your name. May we never forget that our success, our prosperity, and our very lives are blessings from you. Fill us with joy as we seek to serve you faithfully. In Jesus' name, Amen.
