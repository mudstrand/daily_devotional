Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, inspired by the faith of those who have gone before us. Like the people in Hebrews 11, we too long for the heavenly homeland You have promised, even when our earthly desires and expectations remain unfulfilled. Grant us the perseverance and vision to keep our eyes fixed on the eternal prize, trusting in Your perfect timing and plan. May we never lose hope, but continue to believe in Your goodness and faithfulness, even in the face of earthly disappointments. We pray this in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Amen.
