Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, acknowledging our sinfulness and the judgment we deserve. Yet, we are in awe of Your grace, for You sent Your Son, Jesus, to the cross, that our names might be written not in the dust, but in the Lamb's Book of Life. We rejoice in the salvation and security we have in Christ, for no enemy can snatch us from Your loving hands. May we walk in the fullness of life that You have graciously provided. Amen.
