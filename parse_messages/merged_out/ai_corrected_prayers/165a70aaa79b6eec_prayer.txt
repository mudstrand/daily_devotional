Heavenly Father, we give thanks for your steadfast love and favor upon those who walk uprightly before you. May we ever seek to dwell in your presence, delighting in the way of righteousness and finding our joy in serving you. Guide us, Lord, that we may know the blessings you have promised to those who trust in you. In your name, we pray. Amen.
