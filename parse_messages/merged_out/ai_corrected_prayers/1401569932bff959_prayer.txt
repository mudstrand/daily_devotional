Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, acknowledging our need to draw near to You. Help us to resist the temptations of the devil and to lead lives of purity, cleansed from sin. May we express our heartfelt sorrow for our wrongdoings and bow down before You, recognizing that our worth comes from You alone. Lord, lift us up and give us the dignity that only You can provide. In Your name, we pray. Amen.
