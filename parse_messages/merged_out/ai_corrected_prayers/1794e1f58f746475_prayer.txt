Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, seeking Your wisdom and guidance. Help us to be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry, as Your Word instructs. May our righteous anger be directed toward the injustices and sins that harm others, not the selfish desires of our own egos. Grant us the self-control to respond with compassion and understanding, rather than with hurtful words or actions. Cleanse our hearts, Lord, and fill us with Your perfect peace. Amen.
