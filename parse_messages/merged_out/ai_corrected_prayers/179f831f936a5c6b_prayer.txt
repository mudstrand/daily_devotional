Heavenly Father, we thank You for the wisdom found in Your Word, which guides us to walk in the path of righteousness. Grant us discernment to recognize the temptations of the evil one, and the strength to resist the allure of wickedness. May we ever delight in Your ways and find our joy in following the righteous path that leads to life. In Jesus' name, Amen.
