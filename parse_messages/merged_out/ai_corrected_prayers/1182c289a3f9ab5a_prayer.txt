Heavenly Father, we come before you with grateful hearts, acknowledging the unity and fellowship we share through the sacrifice of your Son, Jesus Christ. As we partake of the bread and the cup, may we be reminded of the deep connection we have with you and with one another as the body of Christ. May this sacred meal strengthen our faith and deepen our commitment to live in harmony, serving one another with love. We thank you for this precious gift. Amen.
