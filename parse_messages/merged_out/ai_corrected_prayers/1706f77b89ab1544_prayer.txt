Heavenly Father, we come before You with hearts longing to see Your kingdom established and Your will done on earth as it is in heaven. Grant us the same zeal as the prophet Isaiah, that we may tirelessly pray and work for Your purposes to be fulfilled. May our petitions for others be persistent, trusting in Your perfect timing and sovereign plan. We surrender ourselves to You, that Your will may be done in our lives and in this world. Amen.
