Heavenly Father, we give thanks for Your unwavering love and faithfulness towards Your chosen people, Israel, and all who put their trust in Christ. May the veil be lifted from the eyes of the Jewish people, that they may recognize Jesus as their long-awaited Messiah. Pour out Your Spirit, that the fullness of Your salvation may be revealed to all who call upon Your name. In this way, may Your kingdom come and Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Amen.
