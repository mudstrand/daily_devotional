Heavenly Father, we confess our tendency toward pride and self-centeredness, which leads us to covet the things of this world. Forgive us for our greedy appetites and help us to humble ourselves before You, the giver of all good gifts. May Your Holy Spirit fill us, so that we may see the fleeting nature of earthly attractions and find our true satisfaction in You alone. We long to draw near to You, that You may draw near to us. In Jesus' name, Amen.
