Heavenly Father, we come before you, acknowledging the battle we face against the allure of sin. Help us to walk by your Spirit, not giving in to the desires of the flesh. Grant us the supernatural power to live for you and others, ruling over sin instead of letting it consume our lives. May we rely on your Spirit to guide us and empower us to do what is right. In Jesus' name, Amen.
