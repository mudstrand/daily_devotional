Heavenly Father, we give thanks for the example of the Apostle Paul, who boldly proclaimed the gospel even when chained and imprisoned. May we, like him, seize every opportunity to share the good news of Jesus Christ in our daily lives, unashamed of the power of the gospel to save. Use us as your witnesses, that many may come to know the salvation found in Christ. We pray this in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.
