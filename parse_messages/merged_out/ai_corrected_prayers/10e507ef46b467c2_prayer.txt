Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, for You have sent Your Son, the Anointed Christ, to teach, preach, and heal. Through His ministry, He has shown us the way to understanding, commitment, and wholeness. Lord, may we heed His teachings, respond to His call, and experience the transformative power of Your healing. We trust in Your Son, the Savior of the world, and we give You all the glory. Amen.
