Heavenly Father, we come before you with grateful hearts, seeking the wisdom that you so graciously offer. Help us to love you and your ways, that we may find the hidden treasures of your truth. Strengthen our resolve to diligently search for your wisdom, that we may grow in understanding and walk in the light of your counsel. May our lives be a reflection of your love and wisdom, that others may be drawn to the riches of knowing you. In Jesus' name, Amen.
