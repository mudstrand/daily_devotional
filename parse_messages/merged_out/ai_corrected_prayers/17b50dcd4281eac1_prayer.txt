Heavenly Father, we give thanks for the fountain of Your wisdom, which is a life-giving spring that washes away the deadly effects of sin and fills us with the hope of eternal life. Help us to live by Your Word, that we may be made happy, healthy, and alive forever in Your presence. May we choose to be enlightened by Your wisdom and not be dragged down by the weight of our own foolishness. Amen.
