Heavenly Father, we give thanks that Jesus is our Good Shepherd, who protects, guides, and provides for us. Thank you for the security we find in resting in your green meadows and being led beside your peaceful streams. Help us to hear your voice and follow where you lead, trusting in your care for us. Amen.
