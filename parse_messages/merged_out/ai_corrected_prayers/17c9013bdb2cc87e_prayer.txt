Heavenly Father, we thank You for the wisdom found in Your Word, especially in the Book of Proverbs. Help us to cultivate the qualities of the virtuous woman, who feared You and lived according to Your will. Grant us the diligence, foresight, and compassion to honor You in all we do, that we may find true success and worth in Your sight. May our lives be a testament to Your goodness and grace. Amen.
