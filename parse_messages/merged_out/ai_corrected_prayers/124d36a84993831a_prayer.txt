Heavenly Father, we give thanks that the work of faith in our hearts is not dependent on our own strength, but on Your steadfast love and mercy. Thank you for beginning the good work of salvation in us, and for Your promise to carry it through to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. Help us to remain faithful to Your Word and sacraments, that our faith may be strengthened and sustained by Your power. We trust in Your unwavering love, which nothing can separate us from. Amen.
