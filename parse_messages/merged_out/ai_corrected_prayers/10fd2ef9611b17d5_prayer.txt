Heavenly Father, we praise You for exalting Your Son Jesus to the highest place, giving Him authority over all things in heaven and on earth. Though we do not yet see Him reigning on earth, we trust in His sovereign power and the promise of His ultimate victory. When we are perplexed by the challenges of this world, help us to fix our eyes on the glory and majesty of our Lord Jesus Christ, the King of kings and Lord of lords. May this truth bring us stability, hope, and peace as we wait for the day when every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. Amen.
