Heavenly Father, we come before You with hearts filled with the desire to love one another as You have loved us. May our love not be mere words, but actions that demonstrate the truth of Your gospel. Help us to love our brothers and sisters, not for their usefulness or praise, but out of a sense of duty and care for their well-being. May we use the gifts and resources You have entrusted to us to serve those in need, regardless of their status or circumstances. Guide us, Lord, to love one another with genuine affection, as You have loved us. Amen.
