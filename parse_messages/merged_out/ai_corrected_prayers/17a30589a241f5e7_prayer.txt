Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, seeking the wisdom that You so graciously offer. Help us to heed the call of Proverbs 3:1, to listen attentively to Your words and store Your commands within our hearts. May we be those who love faithfully, trust in You, and turn away from evil. Grant us the discernment to distinguish right from wrong, and the courage to walk in the way of righteousness. Lord, we desire the abundant life that comes from living in Your wisdom, that we may enjoy Your favor, find success, and experience the peace and protection that only You can provide. In Your name, we pray. Amen.
