Heavenly Father, we come before you with grateful hearts, for you are the provider of all good things. Like the young lions, we too may face times of want and hunger, but we trust in your unfailing love and provision. Lord, help us to seek you first, to rely on your wisdom and strength, and to find our true satisfaction in you alone. May we never lack any good thing, for you are the source of all blessings. Amen.
