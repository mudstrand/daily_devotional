Heavenly Father, we give thanks for your mighty acts of deliverance, leading your people through the cloud and the sea, providing for their every need in the wilderness. Just as you were faithful to the Israelites, may we too be united with Christ, baptized into his death and resurrection, and sustained by the spiritual food and drink that nourish our souls. Guide us, Lord, as we journey through this world, that we may remain steadfast in your love. Amen.
