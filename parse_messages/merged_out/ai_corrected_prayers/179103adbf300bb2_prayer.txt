Heavenly Father, we thank You for the gift of Your Holy Spirit, which empowers and emboldens us to proclaim the Gospel. As the apostles were filled with wisdom and strength on the Day of Pentecost, we pray that Your Spirit would move in our hearts and lives, prompting us to speak of the salvation found in Your Son, Jesus Christ. May Your Spirit be the guiding light that illuminates the darkness, bringing the truth and love of Christ to all the world. Amen.
