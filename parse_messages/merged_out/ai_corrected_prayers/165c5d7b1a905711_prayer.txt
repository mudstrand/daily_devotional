Heavenly Father, we give thanks for the gift of children and the joy they bring when they walk in Your ways. May our homes be filled with the wisdom that comes from You, that our children may grow in understanding and honor You in all they do. Help us as parents to guide them with Your truth, that we may rejoice in their godly character more than any earthly success. In Jesus' name, Amen.
