Heavenly Father, we thank You for calling us out of darkness and into Your marvelous light. Help us to walk as children of the light, bearing the fruit of Your Spirit—goodness, faithfulness, and truth. May we live in the full radiance of Your presence, producing works that honor and glorify You. Guide us, Lord, to live as lights in this world, shining brightly for Your kingdom. Amen.
