Heavenly Father, we come before You with hearts full of faith, trusting in Your character and clinging to Your promises. Even when the fulfillment of Your Word is not yet seen, we choose to believe that You are faithful and true, that You will accomplish all that You have declared. Grant us the unwavering hope of Abraham, who against all hope believed and was fully convinced that You would do what You had promised. May our faith in You grow stronger each day as we wait with patient endurance for the manifestation of Your perfect plan. Amen.
