Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, acknowledging that You alone are worthy of all glory and praise. Help us to follow the example of John the Baptist, who willingly decreased so that Christ might increase. May we never be tempted to seek our own success or achievements above the advancement of Your kingdom. Lord, release us from all personal ambitions and selfish motives, that we may serve You with pure hearts and selfless love. In Your Son's name we pray, Amen.
