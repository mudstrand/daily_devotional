Heavenly Father, we come before you, acknowledging the power of our words and the impact they can have on others. Help us to be mindful of how we use our mouths, that they may be instruments of grace and not weapons of destruction. Grant us the wisdom to speak words that build up, encourage, and bring restoration to the relationships in our lives. May our tongues be tools for construction, not demolition. We ask this in the name of Jesus, the Word made flesh. Amen.
