Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, acknowledging that it is by Your grace alone that we are saved, not by our own works (Ephesians 2:8-9). Yet, we know that true faith in You must be accompanied by a changed life and good deeds (James 2:18). Help us, Lord, to live out our faith, not merely professing it, but demonstrating it through our actions. May our lives be a testament to Your transformative power, that others may see our good works and glorify You (Matthew 5:16). In Your name, we pray. Amen.
