Heavenly Father, we rejoice in the good news of great joy that the birth of Your Son, our Savior, Christ the Lord, has brought to all people. May the light of His presence dispel the darkness and fill our hearts with Your peace and joy, not just during this season, but every day of the year. Help us to treasure Your blessings and live in the wonder of Your love. In Jesus' name, Amen.
