Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, rejoicing in the birth of our Savior, Jesus Christ. May the Christmas cheer, bells, and carols fill us with the joy and peace that only You can provide. Help us to remember the glorious proclamation of Your Son's arrival and the song of the angels, that we may give "Glory to God in the highest." Guide us to keep our focus on Jesus, our King, throughout this season and always. Amen.
