Heavenly Father, we come to you this day with hearts that may be heavy, but also with the assurance that you are our shield and our strength. Like David, we take refuge in you, for you alone can sustain us through the trials and tribulations we face. Help us to rest in the knowledge that our safety and security are found in your loving presence, and that with you, we can face each new day with confidence and hope. In your name, we pray. Amen.
