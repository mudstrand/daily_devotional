Heavenly Father, we acknowledge that the earth and all it contains belong to You. You are the rightful Owner and sovereign Lord over all creation. Help us to be faithful stewards, recognizing that everything we possess is a gift from Your hand. May we never become devoted to the things of this world, but instead use our resources wisely to honor and glorify You. In Jesus' name, Amen.
