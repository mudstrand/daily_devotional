Heavenly Father, we come before you, acknowledging that we cannot serve both you and the ways of this world. Help us to fully surrender our lives to you, to commune with you at your table, and to reject any allegiance to the powers of darkness. May we walk in the freedom and victory that comes from being united with Christ and his sacrifice. We desire to give you our complete devotion, Lord. Amen.
