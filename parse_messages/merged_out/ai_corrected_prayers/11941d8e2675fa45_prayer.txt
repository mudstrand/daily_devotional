Heavenly Father, we confess that we often rely on our own strength and wisdom, forgetting that our true source of power and guidance is in You. Help us to trust in You with all our hearts and acknowledge You in all our ways, that You may direct our paths according to Your perfect will. When we feel weak and unable, draw us closer to Yourself, that we may find our strength and hope in Your unfailing love. In Your name we pray, Amen.
