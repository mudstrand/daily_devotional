Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, seeking to know You more deeply. As Your Word instructs, we desire the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom. Grant us understanding that we may revere You as our God and Father, worshiping You in spirit and in truth. May our lives reflect the reverence and awe that is due to Your holy name. We ask this in the precious name of Jesus. Amen.
