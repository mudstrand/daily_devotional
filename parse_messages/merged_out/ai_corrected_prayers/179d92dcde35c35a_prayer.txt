Heavenly Father, we come before You, seeking to honor You with our words and actions. Forgive us for the times we have been tempted to exaggerate or deceive, for we know that You desire us to be people of integrity, whose "yes" is yes and whose "no" is no. Help us to cultivate a reputation of trustworthiness, that we may be a reflection of Your truth and grace to all we encounter. May our lives be a testament to the power of Your Spirit working within us. Amen.
