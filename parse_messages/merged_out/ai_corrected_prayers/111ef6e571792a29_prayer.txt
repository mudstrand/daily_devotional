Gracious Heavenly Father, we come before You, acknowledging the tendency of our hearts to harbor bitterness and resentment. Help us to uproot the bitter roots that seek to take hold, lest they defile and divide us. Fill us instead with Your Spirit of compassion, kindness, and forgiveness, that we may extend the same grace to others as You have so freely given to us. May our relationships be marked by the unity and love that reflect Your heart. Empower us to walk in humility, gentleness, and patience, bearing with one another and forgiving as You have forgiven us. Amen.
