Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, acknowledging that true security is found not in the wealth and possessions of this world, but in You alone. Help us to not be deceived by the false sense of security that material things can provide, but to instead place our trust fully in You, the source of all true and lasting riches. May we seek first Your kingdom and Your righteousness, knowing that all else will be provided for us. In Jesus' name, Amen.
