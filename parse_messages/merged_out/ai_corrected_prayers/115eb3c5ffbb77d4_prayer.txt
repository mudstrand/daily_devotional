Heavenly Father, we give thanks for Your boundless grace and mercy, which extends to all people—both Jew and Gentile. We pray that the hearts of Your chosen people would be softened, that they may see the truth of Your Son, Jesus Christ, and find salvation in Him. May the reconciliation of the Jews to Your Kingdom bring great joy, as when the lost are found and the dead are made alive. Lord, use us as instruments to share the good news of the Gospel, that all may come to know You. Amen.
