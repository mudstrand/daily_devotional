Heavenly Father, we thank You for the glorious truth of the cross, where Christ took the curse of sin upon Himself and redeemed us from its power. We rejoice that in Him, we are no longer condemned, but have been set free from the law of sin and death. May we ever cling to the fellowship of His suffering, dying to self that we might live for You. We praise You for this everlasting redemption and the sure hope it provides to the lost and hopeless. Amen.
