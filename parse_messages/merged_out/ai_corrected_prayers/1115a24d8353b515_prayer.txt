Heavenly Father, we give thanks that in Christ, there is no condemnation for those who are in Him. Your perfect love has driven out our fear of judgment, for we are saved by Your grace through faith in Jesus. May we rest securely in the assurance of Your unfailing mercy and live each day in the freedom and joy of Your love. Amen.
