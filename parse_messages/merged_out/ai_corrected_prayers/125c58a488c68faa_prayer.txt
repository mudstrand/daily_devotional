Heavenly Father, we give You thanks for the indescribable gift of Your Son, Jesus Christ. Through Him, we have received everything we need for salvation—forgiveness, peace, power, comfort, and eternal life. We are humbled by Your great love that led You to send Your only begotten Son to this world, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. May we ever be grateful for this precious gift and live in the light of Your grace. Amen.
