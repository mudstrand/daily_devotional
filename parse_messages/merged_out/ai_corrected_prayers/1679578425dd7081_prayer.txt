Heavenly Father, we give thanks for the gift of true friendship, where love and truth go hand in hand. Help us to follow the example of Your Son, who laid down His life for His friends, that we may speak the truth in love to those around us. May our friendships reflect the depth of Your love and the courage to confront sin with compassion. In Jesus' name, Amen.
