Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, for Your Word is a lamp to our feet and a light to our path. As we meditate on the Scriptures, may our confidence in Your perfect plan for our lives grow stronger. Help us to diligently seek Your wisdom and guidance, that we may walk in the light of Your truth, ever trusting in Your unfailing love and care. May the lessons of the past instill in us a steadfast hope for the future. We thank You, Lord, for the precious gift of Your Word. Amen.
