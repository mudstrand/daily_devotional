Heavenly Father, we stand in awe of Your Son, who humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross (Philippians 2:8). We are humbled that while we were still weak, Christ died for the ungodly (Romans 5:6). Thank you for this incredible display of love, that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us (Romans 5:8). May we never take for granted the sacrifice of Your Son, who bore the curse that we deserved. In His name, we pray. Amen.
