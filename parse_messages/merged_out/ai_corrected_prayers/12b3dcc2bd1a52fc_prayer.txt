Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, acknowledging the unwavering determination of Your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, as He steadfastly set His face toward Jerusalem, where He would fulfill Your plan of salvation for all mankind through His death on the cross. Grant us the courage and the resolve to follow in His footsteps, to walk the path that leads to glory, even when it may be difficult or unpopular. May our watchword be, "I too go 'up to Jerusalem.'" In Your Son's name we pray. Amen.
