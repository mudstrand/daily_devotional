Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, acknowledging the power and wisdom of Your gospel. Though the world may see it as foolishness, we know that it is the very power of God for the salvation of all who believe. Grant us the courage and boldness of Paul, that we may proclaim the truth of Your Son's sacrifice without shame, even in the face of persecution. May our lives be a testament to the transformative power of Your love. In the name of Jesus, we pray. Amen.
