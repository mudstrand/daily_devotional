Heavenly Father, we come before You in humble gratitude, acknowledging that in Adam we have died to Your life and will, but in Christ, we are made partakers of a new spiritual life - a death to sin and a rising into Your divine will. Just as Christ died on the cross, we too have been crucified with Him, and it is no longer we who live, but Christ who lives in us. May we fully embrace the power and blessing that the crucified Lord has won, that our old nature may be put to death, and we may be raised to new life in You. Amen.
