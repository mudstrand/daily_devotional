Heavenly Father, we give You thanks for the glorious Gospel You have revealed to us. You have displayed Your majesty through the wonders of creation and sent Your Son to redeem us from sin. Yet, there are many who disregard Your Word and follow their own desires. Lord, open the eyes of those who have turned away, that they may know the truth and walk in Your ways. May Your Holy Spirit nurture the life of godliness within us, that we may honor You in all we do. Amen.
