Heavenly Father, we give thanks that You know the way of the righteous, and the way of the wicked will perish. Help us to discern Your truth and not be swayed by the allure of the world. May we walk in the way of the righteous, guided by Your wisdom and sustained by Your love. We trust in Your sovereign plan and pray that Your kingdom would come and Your will be done. Amen.
