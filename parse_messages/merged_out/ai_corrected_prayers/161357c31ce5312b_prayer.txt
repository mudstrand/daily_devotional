Gracious Heavenly Father, we come before you with grateful hearts, acknowledging your sovereignty and the promise of Christ's return. Help us to live with diligence and vigilance, ever mindful of the urgency of the times. May we be found faithful, walking in the light, and ready to welcome our Savior when he comes. We pray this in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Redeemer. Amen.
