Heavenly Father, we come before You in these perilous times, seeking Your wisdom and guidance. Help us to walk carefully, not as unwise but as wise, redeeming the time, for the days are evil. Strengthen us to not be conformed to this world, but to be transformed by the renewing of our minds, that we may discern Your good, acceptable, and perfect will. May our lives be a reflection of Your love and grace to a world in need of a Savior. Amen.
