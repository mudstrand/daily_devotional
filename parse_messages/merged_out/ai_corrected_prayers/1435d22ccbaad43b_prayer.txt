Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, seeking Your guidance and wisdom. As we read the words of the Psalmist and the wisdom found in Proverbs, we are reminded of the importance of steadfast love and faithfulness. Lord, help us not to grow weary in our prayers, but to trust in Your perfect timing and sovereign plan. May our faith be strengthened, even in the midst of unanswered prayers, for we know that You hear our cries and will answer according to Your will. We surrender ourselves to You, Lord, and pray that Your love and truth would be the foundation of our lives. Amen.
