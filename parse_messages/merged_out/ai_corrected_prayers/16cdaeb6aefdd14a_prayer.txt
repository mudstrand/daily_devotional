Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, for You have sustained Your people through times of persecution and hardship. Just as the Church has endured throughout the ages, we trust in Your promise that the powers of hell will not conquer it. When we face discrimination and trials, grant us the courage to stand firm in our faith, knowing that You will bring us through the tough times. May we always remember that our hope is in You, the unshakable foundation of Your Church. Amen.
