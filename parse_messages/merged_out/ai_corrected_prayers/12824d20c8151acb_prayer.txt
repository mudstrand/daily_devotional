Heavenly Father, we long for the day when we shall see You face to face, as You are. With eyes of faith, we glimpse Your glory in Your Word, but we eagerly await the moment when we behold Your spotless purity, Your splendid power, and Your saving grace in all their fullness. Thank You for adopting us as Your children through Your great love. We cannot wait to gaze upon the One who has redeemed us. Amen.
