Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, recognizing that our faith can sometimes become more about outward appearances than a genuine relationship with You. Help us to not be like the religious leaders who honored You with their lips, but whose hearts were far from You. Forgive us for the times we have limited Your power and presence by our own preconceptions and lack of faith. Lord, open our eyes to see Your work in unexpected ways, and fill us with a faith that is alive and pleasing to You. In Jesus' name, Amen.
