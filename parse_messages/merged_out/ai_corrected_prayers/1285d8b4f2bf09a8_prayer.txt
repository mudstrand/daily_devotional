Heavenly Father, we come before You, acknowledging that You alone know the future and the plans You have for us. Help us to trust in You with all our hearts and not lean on our own understanding. Guide us in Your paths, and may Your presence be our constant companion, even when the way ahead is uncertain. For we know that You will never leave us nor forsake us, but will come to us and reveal Yourself to us. In Your steadfast love, we find our security and peace. Amen.
