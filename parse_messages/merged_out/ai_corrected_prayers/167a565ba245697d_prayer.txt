Heavenly Father, we rejoice in the good news of great joy that You have brought to all people—the birth of our Savior, the Messiah, the Lord. In this season and always, may the headline of our lives be the glorious truth that Christ the Savior is born. Fill our hearts with gratitude and our lives with the light of Your salvation. Amen.
