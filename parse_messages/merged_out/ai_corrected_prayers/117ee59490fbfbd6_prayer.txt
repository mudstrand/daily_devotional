Heavenly Father, we thank You for the gifts and callings You have bestowed upon us. Like the Apostle Paul, may we be driven by a desire to honor You and serve Your kingdom through the unique talents and abilities You have entrusted to us. Help us to recognize and cultivate these gifts, that we may use them faithfully to spread the Good News and bring glory to Your name. May our hearts be filled with the same passion and commitment that compelled Paul to preach the gospel, even when it was difficult. Guide us, Lord, to steward our gifts for Your purposes. Amen.
