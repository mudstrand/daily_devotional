Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, for Your Word is true and unchanging. We thank You for the good news of salvation through Your Son, Jesus Christ. Guard our hearts and minds against any false teachings or deceptions that would twist the truth of the gospel. May we stand firm in the faith once delivered to the saints, never wavering or compromising Your eternal message of grace and redemption. Let us boldly proclaim the power of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes. Amen.
