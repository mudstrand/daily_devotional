Heavenly Father, we come before You, acknowledging that You are a righteous and holy God. You are just in Your judgment of the wicked, for their ways are evil and displeasing in Your sight. Yet, we are in awe of Your compassion, for You are near to the brokenhearted and save the crushed in spirit. We humbly seek Your mercy, Lord, that You would deliver us from our sins and grant us the grace to walk in Your ways. May our hearts be contrite before You, that we may find refuge in Your steadfast love. Amen.
