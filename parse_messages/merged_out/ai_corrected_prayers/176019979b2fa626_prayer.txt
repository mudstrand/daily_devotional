Heavenly Father, we come to You with grateful hearts, acknowledging the many blessings You have bestowed upon us. Help us to shift our focus from our troubles and trials, and instead count the joys, the gains, and the kind deeds that fill our lives. Remind us to find our strength and hope in You, rather than in ourselves. May we rejoice in Your presence and cast our anxieties upon You, knowing that Your peace surpasses all understanding. In Your name, we pray. Amen.
