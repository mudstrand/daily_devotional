Heavenly Father, we come before you, seeking the wisdom that comes from above. Help us to turn away from the empty promises of worldly wisdom, which only leads to ruin. Grant us the understanding that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, for in knowing and revering you, we find the true path to life. May we walk in your ways, guided by the light of your Word, that we may bring glory to your name. Amen.
