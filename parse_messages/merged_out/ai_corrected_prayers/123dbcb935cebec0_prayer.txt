Heavenly Father, we come to You, the ever-present help in times of trouble. We confess that we are sinful and deserve punishment, but we are grateful that You have sent Your Son to pay the penalty for our sins and break the curse of sin. Through Your Word, You stand by our side, offering forgiveness and power against temptation. We cling to Your promise that the wages of sin are death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen.
