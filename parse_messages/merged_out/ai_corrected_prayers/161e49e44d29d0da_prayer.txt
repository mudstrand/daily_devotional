Heavenly Father, we give thanks for the promise of the Resurrection and the transformation of our weak mortal bodies into glorious, imperishable forms like that of our Savior, Jesus Christ. We eagerly await the redemption of our bodies, longing for the day when we will be freed from the struggles and sufferings of this world. Lord, strengthen our hope and fill us with joy as we anticipate the day when we will be raised to new life in Your eternal kingdom. Amen.
