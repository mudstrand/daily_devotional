Heavenly Father, we come before You, longing to be free from the power of sin that so easily entangles us. We thank You that in Christ, there is no condemnation, and that as we abide in Him, we can be enabled by Your Spirit to live in a way that pleases You. Help us to continually fix our eyes on Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith, that we may walk in newness of life and do what is right in Your sight. May Your work in us bear fruit that glorifies Your name. Amen.
