Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, longing to dwell in Your presence, as David did. May our greatest desire be to live each day in the light of Your temple, where we find the fullness of joy and eternal pleasures at Your right hand. Lord, ignite in us a passion to seek Your face and to delight in the wonders of Your dwelling place. We pray that You would guide us and protect us, that we may worship You without fear, now and forevermore. Amen.
