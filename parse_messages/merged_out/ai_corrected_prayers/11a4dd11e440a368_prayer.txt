Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, recognizing that Your kingdom is advanced through the generosity and compassion of Your people. Just as the churches in Macedonia and Achaia joined together to support the saints in Jerusalem, may we too seek opportunities to link arms with believers beyond our own circles, that we may increase Christian unity and further Your work in the world. Give us open eyes to see the needs around us, and open hands to share the blessings You have entrusted to us. May our giving be a tangible expression of Your love. Amen.
