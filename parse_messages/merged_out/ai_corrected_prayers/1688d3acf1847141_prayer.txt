Heavenly Father, we come before You, weary and discouraged, yet clinging to the truth that in You, we can do all things. Like those who have gone before us, we face hardship and struggle, but we know that this is the training ground where our patience is forged and our victory in You made sweeter. Grant us the strength and perseverance to endure, that we may not grow weary or lose heart, but press on toward the prize of our high calling in Christ Jesus. In Your mighty name, we pray. Amen.
