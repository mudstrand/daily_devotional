Heavenly Father, we give thanks for the example of the early church, where the believers were united in heart and mind, and Your power was evident through their witness. Lord, grant us the same spirit of unity and devotion, that our church may be a beacon of Your love and grace, drawing others to know the salvation found in Jesus Christ. May our lives and our community reflect the transformative work of Your Spirit, that many may come to know You. Amen.
