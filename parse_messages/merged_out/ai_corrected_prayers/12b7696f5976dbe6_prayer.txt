Heavenly Father, we are humbled by your personal invitation to be your holy people. Though we have wandered and sinned, you have sought us out and offered us forgiveness through your Son, Jesus Christ. We gratefully accept your call, trusting in the work of the cross to cleanse us and welcome us into your glorious kingdom. May we live as citizens worthy of your name. Amen.
