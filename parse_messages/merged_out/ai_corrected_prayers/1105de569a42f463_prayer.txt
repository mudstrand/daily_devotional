Heavenly Father, we come before you, humbled by the power and authority of your living Word. May it pierce our hearts, revealing our true selves, both the good and the evil. Help us to not merely listen, but to let your Word transform us, conforming us to the image of your Son. Grant us the wisdom and courage to make the decisions necessary to align our lives with your perfect will. We surrender ourselves as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to you. Amen.
