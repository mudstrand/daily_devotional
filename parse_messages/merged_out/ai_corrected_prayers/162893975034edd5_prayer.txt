Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, seeking Your wisdom and discernment. Help us to walk carefully, not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity (Ephesians 5:15-16). Grant us the strength to hold fast to Your instructions, not turning to the right or to the left (Proverbs 4:13, 14). May we have the courage to proceed with caution when we feel ourselves being heavily influenced, that our actions may always bring honor to Your name. Amen.
