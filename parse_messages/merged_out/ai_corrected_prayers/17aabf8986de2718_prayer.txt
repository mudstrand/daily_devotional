Heavenly Father, we come before You, acknowledging the wisdom found in Your Word. Help us to be slow to anger and quick to respond with gentleness, for a gentle answer turns away wrath. May we seek to speak the truth in love, knowing that Your Word is timeless and trustworthy. Guide us to walk in a manner worthy of Your calling, that we may bring glory to Your name. Amen.
