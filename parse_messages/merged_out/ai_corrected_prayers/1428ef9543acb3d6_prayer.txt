Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, acknowledging that we are not without sin. Yet, like David, we desire to walk in integrity and fellowship with You. Search our hearts, O Lord, and know us completely. Reveal any hidden faults or unrighteousness within us, that we may confess and turn from them. Cleanse us according to Your steadfast love and clear our names of any false charges or accusations. Guide us, Lord, that we may live in a manner pleasing to You. Amen.
