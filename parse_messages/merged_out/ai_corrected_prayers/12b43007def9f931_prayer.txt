Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, recognizing the importance of maintaining right relationships with one another. Help us to heed the conviction of the Holy Spirit and not overlook the "tiny things" that may be hindering our fellowship with You. Grant us the wisdom and courage to resolve any conflicts or grievances we have with others, that our love for You may be reflected in our love for our neighbors. May we be quick to make amends and slow to harbor bitterness or resentment. Lord, purify our hearts and align our relationships with Your perfect will. Amen.
