Heavenly Father, we come before You with hearts full of gratitude for the sacrifice of Your Son, Jesus Christ. May our lives be a continual offering of praise as we share the good news of salvation and show Your love through acts of kindness and generosity. Help us to be faithful stewards of all that You have entrusted to us, that our lives may bring glory to Your name. Amen.
