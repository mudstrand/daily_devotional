Heavenly Father, we come to You, the fountain of life, seeking to be filled with Your abundant love and delight. In the midst of the demands and challenges of this world, we find our strength replenished in Your presence. Your loving-kindness is our refuge, and in the river of Your delights, we are abundantly satisfied. Lord, may we ever trust in You, the source of all life and joy. Amen.
