Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, seeking Your wisdom and guidance. Help us to trust in You with all our hearts and not lean on our own understanding. Direct our paths, that we may walk in Your ways and find the true understanding that comes from You alone. May our faith in You be the foundation upon which we build our lives. In Your name, we pray. Amen.
