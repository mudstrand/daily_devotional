Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, acknowledging that Your ways are higher than our own. Even in the midst of life's challenges, we trust that Your wisdom leads to true and lasting blessing. Help us to live by faith, not by sight, as we await the glorious return of Your Son, Jesus, and the establishment of Your eternal kingdom. Grant us the discernment to walk in Your ways, that we may experience the peace and joy that come from living according to Your perfect plan. Amen.
