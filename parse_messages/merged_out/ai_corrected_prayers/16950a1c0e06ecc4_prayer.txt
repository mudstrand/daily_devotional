Heavenly Father, we come before you in this quiet moment, seeking to quiet our hearts and minds. Amid the noise and distractions of this world, help us to be still and know that you are God. May we find rest and peace in your presence, and may your voice speak clearly to us, that we may hear and obey. Lord, teach us to turn down the volume of the world so that we may hear your still, small voice. Amen.
