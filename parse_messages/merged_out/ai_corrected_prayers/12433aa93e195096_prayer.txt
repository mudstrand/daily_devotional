Heavenly Father, we come before You, seeking Your gracious presence and blessing. Forgive us our sins and make us Your children, that we may know the peace and security that comes from Your loving care. May Your face shine upon us and grant us the wisdom and provision we need for this life and the next. Guide our steps, both now and forever, that we may walk in Your ways and glorify Your name. Amen.
