Heavenly Father, we come before you, seeking to build our lives on the solid foundation of your Word. Help us to be not merely hearers, but doers of your truth, putting into practice the wisdom and guidance you provide through Scripture. May our lives reflect a genuine faith that weathers the storms, standing firm on the Rock that is Christ Jesus. Grant us the wisdom and discernment to live as obedient disciples, ready to face the challenges of this world with confidence in your unfailing love. Amen.
