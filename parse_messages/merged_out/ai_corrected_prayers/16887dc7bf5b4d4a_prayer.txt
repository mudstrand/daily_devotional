Gracious Heavenly Father, we come before you, seeking to live in a manner that honors your name and brings glory to your kingdom. Help us to cultivate a good reputation, not for our own sake, but that others may see your work in our lives. May we be faithful stewards of the gifts and opportunities you have entrusted to us, reflecting your love and compassion in all that we do. We ask this in the precious name of Jesus. Amen.
