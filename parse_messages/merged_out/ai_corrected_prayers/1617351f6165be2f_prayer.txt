Gracious Heavenly Father, we come before you with grateful hearts, acknowledging that it is a privilege to suffer for your name's sake, just as your servants did in the early church. Help us to embrace the trials and tribulations we face, knowing that they are opportunities to bear witness to your power and love. May our faithfulness in the midst of adversity draw others to the hope and redemption found in Jesus Christ. We trust in your sovereign plan and ask that you grant us the strength and courage to endure, that our lives may bring glory to your name. Amen.
