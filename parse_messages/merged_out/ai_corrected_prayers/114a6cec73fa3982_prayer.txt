Heavenly Father, we come before You, humbled by our sinful nature and our inability to climb the ladder of the law. Thank you for sending Your Son, Jesus, to lift us above the burden of the law and into Your loving presence. May we now obey You out of love, not necessity, and through Your power, not our own. When we stumble, catch us in Your arms and hold us fast. We praise You for Your grace and mercy. Amen.
