Heavenly Father, we are grateful for the gift of Your Son, Jesus Christ, who was tempted in every way, yet remained without sin. In our moments of weakness and struggle, may we find comfort in knowing that Jesus can sympathize with our weaknesses, and that through Him, we too can overcome the power of temptation. Grant us the strength and wisdom to resist the seductive lures of sin and to walk in the path of righteousness, following the example of our Savior. We praise You for Your faithfulness and the hope we have in Christ. Amen.
