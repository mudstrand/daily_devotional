Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, acknowledging the tangled wreckage of our past and the transformative power of Your love. Just as You redeemed the life of Paul, we pray that You would continue to work in us, making us into something new and useful for Your kingdom. May we find joy in knowing Christ and the surpassing worth of His love, that we may serve You and others with renewed purpose. In Your Son's precious name, we pray. Amen.
