Heavenly Father, we praise You for Your sovereign control over all things. Though evil may seem to reign, we trust that Your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, will ultimately defeat all enemies and present to You a perfect new world. Help us to remain steadfast in our faith, knowing that Your plan will be fulfilled in Your perfect timing. May Your kingdom come, and Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Amen.
