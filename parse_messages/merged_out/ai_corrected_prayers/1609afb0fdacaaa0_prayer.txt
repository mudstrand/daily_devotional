Heavenly Father, we praise You for the sovereignty and authority of Your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. He is the Ruler over all creation, the Sustainer of all things, the One who has conquered sin and death to redeem us. May we humbly submit to His Lordship, knowing that no one is beyond the reach of Your saving grace. Use us, Lord, to proclaim the good news of Your Kingdom to all people. Amen.
