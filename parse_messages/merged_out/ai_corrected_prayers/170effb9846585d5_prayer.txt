Heavenly Father, we thank You for the example of Jesus, who came to preach the good news, heal the brokenhearted, and set the captives free. Lord, help us to follow in His footsteps, seeking to spread the love and truth of Your gospel in our workplaces, churches, families, and communities. May we be like the bees, diligently working to bring hope and beauty to the world around us. Guide us by Your Spirit to fulfill the purpose You have for each of us. Amen.
