Heavenly Father, we come before You acknowledging the truth of Your Word—that all have sinned and fall short of Your glory. Though we may question the fairness of inheriting Adam's sin, we confess that we too are prone to rebellion and have confirmed our sinful nature through our own transgressions. Lord, we do not deserve Your justice, but we humbly plead for Your mercy and the redemption found in the cross of Christ. Forgive us, O God, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Amen.
