Heavenly Father, we come before You in humble recognition of our spiritual poverty. We acknowledge that we have no great works or merits to boast of, but only our faith in Your Son, Jesus Christ, who is the source of our salvation. Help us to cultivate a spirit of repentance and a deep dependence on Your grace, that we may be rich in the kingdom of God. May our hearts be like the publican, who cried out for Your mercy and found justification in Your sight. In Your Son's name we pray, Amen.
