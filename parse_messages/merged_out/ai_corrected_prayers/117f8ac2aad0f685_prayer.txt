Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, seeking to follow the example of the Apostle Paul in our witness to the world. Grant us the wisdom to find common ground with those we encounter, to approach them with humility and sensitivity, and to speak words that build them up and point them to Your Son, Jesus Christ. May our lives be a reflection of Your love and grace, that many may come to know the saving power of the gospel. We ask this in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.
