Heavenly Father, we come before you, grateful for the new life we have in Christ. Help us to consider ourselves dead to sin, no longer slaves to our old desires, but alive to you. May the power of the Holy Spirit strengthen us to present our bodies as instruments of righteousness, living for your glory and not our own. Guide us, Lord, as we walk in the newness of life, surrendering our plans to your perfect will. Amen.
