Heavenly Father, we give thanks for the freedom secured for us through the sacrifice of Your Son on the cross. By His death, we are no longer enslaved to sin but have been set free to live for You. May we embrace this precious liberty, no longer striving in vain to earn our salvation but resting in the finished work of Christ. Guide us to use our freedom to serve You and others, that we may bear fruit for Your kingdom. Amen.
