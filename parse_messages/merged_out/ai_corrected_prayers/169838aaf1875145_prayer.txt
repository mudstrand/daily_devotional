Heavenly Father, we come before you, sometimes feeling alone and forgotten in this world. But we are reminded that you see us, that you value each of us, and that you love us so deeply that you sent your only Son to save us. Help us to rest in the knowledge that we are never truly alone, for you are always with us. In your Son's name we pray, Amen.
