Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, seeking Your wisdom and guidance. Help us to trust in You with all our hearts and not lean on our own understanding. May our steps be directed by Your path, that we may walk uprightly and not stray to the right or to the left. Keep our eyes fixed on the goal You have set before us, that we may not be led astray by the temptations of this world. Grant us the strength to stay the course and the discernment to recognize the detours that lead to sin. In Your name, we pray. Amen.
