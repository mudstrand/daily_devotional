Heavenly Father, we come to you in gratitude, for your Son Jesus is the light of the world. When we are lost in the darkness of confusion and doubt, guide us back to the path of your truth. May your light shine brightly, dispelling the shadows that obscure our vision and leading us ever closer to your holy presence. Lord, we trust in your unwavering love and guidance, for in you, we find the peace and direction our souls long for. Amen.
