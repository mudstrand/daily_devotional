Heavenly Father, we praise You for the perfection and trustworthiness of Your Word. Your every promise is true, and Your every command is righteous. Help us to cling to the Scriptures, knowing that they are the unfailing and unchanging revelation of Your will. May we never add to or subtract from Your words, but receive them with humble faith. In Your Son's name we pray, Amen.
