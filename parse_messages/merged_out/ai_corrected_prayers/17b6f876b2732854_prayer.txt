Heavenly Father, we come before You, seeking to be the kind of friend You have called us to be. Help us to love not just in word, but in deed and in truth, as Your Word instructs us. Grant us the wisdom to discern true friendship and the courage to be loyal and steadfast, even in times of distress. May we reflect Your love and compassion to those You have placed in our lives. We pray this in the name of Jesus, our greatest friend. Amen.
