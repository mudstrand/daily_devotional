Heavenly Father, we give thanks for your steadfast love and faithfulness that have sustained us from our youth until this day. In every season of life, may we trust in your perfect timing and find our strength in your abiding presence. As we face the challenges and joys that come with each stage, keep us anchored in your Word and ever-growing in our knowledge of you. May our lives be a testament to your goodness and grace. Amen.
