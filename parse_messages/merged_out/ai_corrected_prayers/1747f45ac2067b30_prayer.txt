Heavenly Father, we stand in awe of Your greatness, for Your greatness is unsearchable (Psalm 145:3). You are beyond our full comprehension, yet You have revealed Yourself to us through Your Word. Help us to humbly accept the limitations of our understanding and to trust in Your perfect wisdom and sovereign plan. May we seek You diligently, knowing that You will guide us and provide the insights we need for life's journey. In Your name, we pray. Amen.
