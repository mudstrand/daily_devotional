Heavenly Father, we stand in awe of Your unfathomable love, that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Thank you for the gift of Your only Son, who came to deliver us from condemnation and offer eternal life to all who believe in Him. Help us not to resist the light of Your truth, but to repent and receive the forgiveness and life You so graciously provide through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
