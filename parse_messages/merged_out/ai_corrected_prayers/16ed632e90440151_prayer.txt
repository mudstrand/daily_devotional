Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, acknowledging that all we do should be done for Your glory. Help us to follow the example of the successful businessman, going above and beyond what is expected, not merely doing the minimum, but doing it "and then some." May we work diligently, as unto You, knowing that our true reward comes from You. Give us the strength and the willingness to go the extra mile, to serve with excellence, and to bring honor to Your name. In Jesus' name, Amen.
