Heavenly Father, we come to you with grateful hearts, knowing that in Christ, we have peace and victory, even in the midst of life's trials and tribulations. Help us to cling to the truth that you have overcome the world, and that through faith in your Son, we too can overcome. Grant us the courage and strength to face each day with unwavering trust in your sovereign plan. May we find our refuge in you, the source of all peace and comfort. Amen.
