Heavenly Father, we thank You for the beautiful design of relationships and the order You have established. Help us to understand the true meaning of submission—not as a sign of inferiority, but as a mutual commitment to one another, rooted in Your perfect will. Grant us the wisdom to submit to You and to one another in love, that we may reflect the harmony found in the Godhead. May our relationships be marked by cooperation, not chaos. We ask this in the name of Christ, our head. Amen.
