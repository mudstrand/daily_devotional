Heavenly Father, we come to you this day with grateful hearts, acknowledging that our strength and hope come from you alone. When we face difficult circumstances, help us to follow the example of David, who trusted in your unfailing love and committed his way to you. May our faith, gratitude, and expectation in your goodness empower us to make the best of the situations we encounter, knowing that you are with us. In your name, we pray. Amen.
