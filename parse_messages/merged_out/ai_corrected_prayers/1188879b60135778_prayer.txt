Heavenly Father, we thank You for the unity we have in Christ, despite our many differences. Help us to remember that we are all one body, baptized by the same Holy Spirit, and united in our faith in You. May we celebrate our diversity of gifts and abilities and use them to build up Your church. Guide us to find common ground in Your love and to live in harmony as Your beloved children. Amen.
