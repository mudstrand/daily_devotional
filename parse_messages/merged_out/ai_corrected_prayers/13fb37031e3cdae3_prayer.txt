Heavenly Father, we come before You with humble hearts, recognizing the wisdom found in Your word. Help us to not be wise in our own eyes, but to fear You and turn away from evil. May we trust in You with all our hearts and not lean on our own understanding. Guide us, Lord, that our bodies may be healed and our bones may be refreshed. We know that the consequences of rejecting Your counsel can be devastating, so we pray for the courage to heed Your voice and walk in Your ways. In Jesus' name, Amen.
