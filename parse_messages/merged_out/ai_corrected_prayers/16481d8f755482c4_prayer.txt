Heavenly Father, we come before you, seeking the wisdom that only you can provide. Help us to walk in the fear of the Lord, that we may grow in understanding and discernment. Guide us to see life through your eyes, that we may know the best course of action to take. May your wisdom be the foundation of our lives, that we may share your knowledge with others and bring glory to your name. In Jesus' name, Amen.
