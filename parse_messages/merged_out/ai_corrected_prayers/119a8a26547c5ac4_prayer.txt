Heavenly Father, we come before You as Your humble vessels, jars of clay entrusted with the priceless treasure of Your salvation in Christ. Though we are weak and frail, we are in awe of Your power that dwells within us. Grant us the strength and wisdom to let Your light shine through our lives, that others may see You and be drawn to Your good news. Keep us ever mindful that the power is Yours, not our own, that we may walk in humility and constant communion with You, our source of strength. In Jesus' name, Amen.
