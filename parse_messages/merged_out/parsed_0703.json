    "original_reflection_text": "Jacob was Isaac's son and Abraham's grandson. Jacob's sons became the fathers of Israel's 12 tribes. Even when Jacob (also called \"Israel\") was dying in a strange land, he believed the promise that Abraham's descendants would be like the sand on the seashore and that Israel would become a great nation. True faith helps us see beyond the grave. True faith brings us to a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.",

    "reflection": "Joseph, one of Jacob's sons, was sold into slavery by his jealous brothers (Genesis 37). Eventually, Joseph was sold again, this time to an official of the Pharaoh of Egypt. Because of Joseph's faithfulness to God, he was given the top-ranking position in Egypt. Although Joseph could have used that position to build a personal empire, he remembered God's promise to Abraham. After he had been reconciled to his brother, Joseph brought his family to be near him and requested that his bones be taken to the Promised Land when the Jews eventually left Egypt. Our lesson is that, faith means trusting God and doing what He wants, regardless of the circumstances or consequences.",
