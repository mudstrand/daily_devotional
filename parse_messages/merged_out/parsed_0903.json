The goal of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit is not just to unite us to God, but to do it is such a way that we will be one with the Father in exactly the same way Jesus was.

AND He says to us, \"As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.\" (John 20:21) If we truly love the Lord, we have no business being guided by natural emotions, we have to feed His sheep.

It takes much more of the grace of God, and a much greater awareness of drawing upon Him, to take that next step, than it does to preach the Gospel. Every Christian must experience the essence of the incarnation by bringing the next step down into flesh-and-blood reality and by working it out with His hands. We need to be careful so as to not lose interest and give up when we have no vision, no encouragement, and no improvement, but only experience our every day trivial tasks. The thing that really testifies for God and for the people of God in the long run is steady perseverance, even when the work can not be seen by others. The only way to live an undefeated life is to live looking to God. Never allow yourself to think that some tasks are beneath your dignity or to insignificant for you to do, remind yourself of the example of Christ in (John 13:1-17)",

    "reflection": "As we see here in this verse all three members of the Trinity are mentioned: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit. Another important fact to recognize is that all three member of the Trinity work to bring about our Salvation. The Father chose us before we chose Him (Ephesians 1:4). Jesus Christ, the Son died for us while we were still sinners (Romans 5:6-10). The Holy Spirit brings us the benefits of salvation and sets us apart (makes us holy, sanctifies us) for God's service (2 Thessalonians 2:13) Let us always remind ourselves that, for all our communion with God, the presence and the power of the Son and the Spirit are absolutely necessary.",

    "reflection": "The best and most wonderful word in heaven is Love. for God is Love. And the best and most wonderful word in the inner chamber must be-- Love. For God meets us there in Love. What is love? It is the deep desire to give oneself for the beloved. Love finds its joy in imparting all that it has to make the loved one happy. And the heavenly Father, who offers to meet us in the inner chamber-let there be no doubt of this in our minds--has no other object than to fill our hearts with His love. All the other attributes of God that are mentioned in His Word find in this their highest glory. The true and full blessing of the inner chamber is nothing less than a life in the abundant love of God.",

    "reflection": "\"Waiting upon God\" in this expression we find one of the deepest truths of God's Word in regard to the attitude of the soul in its communion with God. Waiting upon God. Just think --- maybe if we would just give Him an extra minute He would reveal Himself to us; that He may teach us all His will; that He may do to us what He has promised; that in all things He may be the infinite God. Waiting upon God. Is an attitude of the soul --- with which each day should begin. Upon awakening each morning, in quiet meditation, in the expression in prayer share your deepest longings and desires. In the course of our daily work, in our striving after obedience and holiness, in all our struggles against sin and self-will in everything there should be a waiting upon God to receive what He will bestow, to see what He will do, to allow Him to be Almighty God. Wait on God meditating on these things, and they will help you to value the precious promises of God's Word. They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. Wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and He shall strengthen thine heart. The deep root of all Scriptural theology is this: Absolute dependence on God. As we exercise this spirit, it will become more and more natural and blessedly possible to say: \"On Thee do I wait all the day.\"",
