    "verse": "Because you are sons, God sent the spirit of His Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out \"Abba, Father\" So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, God has made you also an heir. (Galatians 4:6, 7) NIV.",
    "reflection": "Under Roman law, an adopted child was guaranteed all legal rights to his father's property, even if he was formerly a slave. He was not a second-class son, He was equal to all other sons, biological or adopted, in his father's family. As adopted children of God we share with Jesus all rights to God's resources. As God's heirs, we can claim what He has provided for us ~ our full identity as His children. (see Romans 8:15-17)",
    "prayer": "Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the provisions You have made for me. I pray that as a son I would become more and more Christ-like. Amen.",
