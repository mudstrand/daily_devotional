Though I did regret it ~ I see that my letter hurt you, but only for a little while ~ yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us. Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.",
    "prayer": "Heavenly Father, we come before You with hearts heavy with the weight of our sins. Like Peter, we have fallen short and denied You, yet we are grateful for Your grace and mercy that leads to true repentance. May the sorrow we feel over our transgressions not be a worldly sorrow that leads to despair, but a godly sorrow that produces a change of heart and a renewed commitment to follow You. Cleanse us, Lord, and restore us to Your service, that we may walk in obedience and bring glory to Your name. Amen.",
