As followers of Christ, we must be committed to the truth. This means that our words should be honest and that our actions should reflect Christ's integrity. Holding to the truth is not always easy, convenient, or pleasant, but it is necessary if the church is going to do Christ's work in the world. Some Christians fear that any mistake will destroy their witness for the Lord.",
