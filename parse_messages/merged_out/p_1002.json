    "reflection": "Here are some of the predictions of what would happen to Jesus: Psalm 41:9 (the betrayal) ~ Isaiah 53:4-7 (crucifixion) ~ Psalm 16:10 (resurrection) The disciples had all these predictions, yet they didn't understand Jesus, apparently because they were more focused on what He said about His death and ignored what He said about His resurrection. Even though Jesus spoke plainly, they would not OR could not grasp the significance of His words UNTIL they saw the risen Christ face to face. Even though we have the New Testament which tells us \"The wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ or Lord.\" (Romans 6:23), many ignore the \"wages part\" but expect the \"free gift\" part. Yes we are free to choose between two masters, (sin or Christ Jesus) it is either one or the other. You can not serve both.",
