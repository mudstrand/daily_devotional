Heavenly Father, we come before You with grateful hearts, acknowledging that apart from You, we can do nothing. Help us to remain steadfast in our faith, abiding in Christ and bearing the fruit of the Spirit—love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. May our lives be a reflection of Your transformative work within us, that we may bring glory to Your name. Guide us, Lord, to continue believing in Your Son, obeying Your commands, and loving one another as You have loved us. In Jesus' name, Amen.
