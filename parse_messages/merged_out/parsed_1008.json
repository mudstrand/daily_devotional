If there is a problem pressing in on you right now, are you\n\"looking unto Jesus\" (Heb. 12:2) and receiving peace from Him?\n\nLay everything out before Him, and when you are faced with difficulty,\nbereavement, and sorrow, listen to Him say, \"Let not your heart be troubled .\"\n\nPrayer Suggestion:\nDear Lord, help me to always look to You for my\npeace of mind...Amen.\nPastor Alvin & Marcie Sather\n\nThe Lord said, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life. \nNo one can come to he father except through me.\" - John: 14:6",
