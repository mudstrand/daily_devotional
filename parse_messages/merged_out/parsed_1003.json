He took the cup, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in\nmy blood, which is poured out for you.\" (Lk. 22:19, 20)\n\nOur Lesson for Today:\nThat Passover evening Jesus had plenty on His mind. Ahead of Him lay a night \nand a day packed with the worst men could ever invent. Who could have blamed \nHim if He had told those disciples to leave Him alone? But He didn't ! ! ! His love\nfor sinners wouldn't let Him. That love even moved Him to leave a parting gift for \nthem, a blessed inheritance that would help them through the ages.\n\nLooking at His disciple, then and now, He saw how they would need assurance of\nsin forgiven, how often their wounded hearts would need special healing. So in love\nHe gave them a miracle. He left them the treasure of His Holy Supper, in which He \ngives His true body with the bread and His true blood with the wine so that penitent\nsinners might be assured of forgiveness.\n\n\"Go in peace,\" He tells the penitent, \"your sins are forgiven as surely as My body \nand blood prepared that forgiveness which you now have received.\" Now pray:\n\nPrayer Suggestion:\nThank You God for Remembering me, help me remember\nwhat a Savior I have and what He offers me in His meal...Amen.\n\nPastor Alvin & Marcie Sather\n\nThe Lord said, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life. \nNo one can come to the Father except through me.\" - John: 14:6",
