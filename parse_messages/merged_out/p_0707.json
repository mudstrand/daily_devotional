Yet, we are in awe of Your boundless grace and the redemption found in Your Son, Jesus Christ. We give thanks that through His sacrifice, we are made righteous and stand guiltless before You, free from all accusations.

Think about it, no charge can be made against the justified person. He cannot be convicted of any guilt. He is immune to all accusations. As one who has been acquitted before a court, he is pronounced guiltless. He is reckoned as though he had never committed any sin. He is judged to be as spotless and blameless as Christ Himself.",
