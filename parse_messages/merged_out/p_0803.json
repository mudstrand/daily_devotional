    "reflection": "Why does Paul say believers would be miserable if there were only earthly value to Christianity? Well, we need to remember that in Paul's day, Christianity brought a person persecution, ostracism from family, and, in many cases, poverty. There were few tangible benefits from being a Christian in that society. It was certainly not a step up the social or career ladder. More important is the fact that if Christ had not been resurrected from the dead, Christians would not be forgiven of their sins or have any hope of eternal life. Now, just as the first fruits of the harvest were brought to the temple as an offering, so Christ was the first to rise from the dead and never die again. He is our forerunner, the guarantee of our eventual resurrection to eternal life.",
