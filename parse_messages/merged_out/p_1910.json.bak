What is sometimes thought to be humility can be inverse pride, as in being “proud of his humility.” Christian humility is a virtue, a fruit of faith. The human heart is by nature proud, but the Holy Spirit changed that when He brought us to faith in Christ. With faith He gave humility, that is, being what we are-no more--no less. It fits beautifully with the fruit of the Spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, and all the rest. It helps us to be more Christ-like.",
