Yes, of Gentiles to, since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith. Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law. (Romans 3:28-31) NIV",
    "reflection": "A question that is often asked is, \"Why does God save us by faith alone?\" First of all: Faith eliminates the pride of human effort, because faith is not a deed that we do. Second: Faith exalts what God has done, not what we do. Third: Faith admits that we can't keep the law or measure up to God's standards, we need help. Fourth: Faith is based on our relationship with God, not our performance for God. Faith does not wipe out the Old T. Rather, it makes God's dealings with the Jewish people understandable. (See Galatians 3:24-29 and I Tim. 1:8 for mor on this concept. )",
    "prayer": "Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the gift of faith, for I know that by my own efforts I am nothing. I pray for a greater amount of faith so that my thoughts would be inline with Your thoughts. Amen.",

Shall we go on sinning so that \ngrace may increase?\n\nBy no means! We died to sin; how can we live in it any\nlonger...(Ro. 6:1, 2) NIV\n\nOur Thought for Today:\n\nIf God loves to forgive, why not give Him more to forgive?\nIf forgiveness is guaranteed, do we have the freedom to\nsin as much as we want to?\n\nPaul's forceful answer is \"Of course not! Such an attitude-deciding ahead of time to take advantage of God, shows \nthat a person does not understand the seriousness of sin.\n\nGod's forgiveness does not make sin less serious, His Son's\ndeath for sin shows us the dreadful seriousness of sin...\n\nJesus paid with His life so that we could be forgive. The \navailability of God's mercy must not become an excuse for\ncareless living and moral laziness...\n\nOur Prayer for Today:\nDear Heavenly Father, I come before You again, \nseeking forgiveness for my sins. Yes Lord I do \nrealize the seriousness of sin. And I thank You for \nYour Son's willingness to die for my sins. I pray for \nthe safety of our nation, its citizens, and our troops...Amen.\n\nKeep looking up, we have a merciful God...\nYou're in the prayers of two who care...\nPastor Al & Marcie Sather",

They understood baptism to symbolize the death and burial of the old way of life. Coming up out of the water symbolized resurrection to new life in Christ. If we think of our old, sinful life as dead and buried, we have a powerful motive to resist sin. We can consciously choose to treat the desires and temptations of the old nature as if they were dead.
