In a world that so easily turns to idols and false gods, we repent of our misplaced worship and priorities. Forgive us for the ways we have neglected You, the one true God, and have chased after the fleeting pleasures of this world. Lord, may this season of disruption lead us to a personal revival, where we fix our eyes solely on Jesus Christ, the author and perfecter of our faith. Cleanse our hearts, revive our spirits, and may we turn from our wicked ways to wholeheartedly worship and serve You. Amen.",

    "reflection": "Read these two verses once again. Don't you think that we should be concerned? GOD DEALING WITH TODAY’S IDOL WORSHIP In three short months just like God did with the plagues In Egypt, God has taken away everything we worship. We are known for the worship of athletes, so I will Shut down your stadiums. We worship our musicians, I will shut down your Civic Centers. We worship actors, I will shut down the theaters. We worship money, I will shut down the economy and crush the stock market. You don’t want to go to church and worship me, I will make it so you can’t go to church. If my people called by my name will humble them selves and pray and keep the faith, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear them from heaven and forgive their sins and heal their land. Maybe we don’t need a vaccine! maybe instead we should take the time to avoid the distractions of the world and have a personal revival where we focus on the only thing in the world that really matters, Jesus Christ.",
