    "reflection": "Some people succeed in everything they do, and they brag that no one, not even God, can keep them down. We may wonder why God allow them to gain great wealth, while they despise Him as they do. BUT why are we upset when the wicked prosper? Are we angry about the damage they are doing, or just jealous of their success? To answer these questions, we must gain the right perspective on wickedness and wealth. The wicked will surely be punished because God hates their evil deeds. Wealth is only temporary, it is not necessarily a sign of God's approval on a person's life, nor a lack of it a sign of God's disapproval. Don't let wealth become your obsession",

Many people have become deceivers, liars, and flatterers—they believe they will get what they want by deception. As a king, David certainly faced these kinds of people, who hoped to win his favor and gain advancement through flattery.
