We dare not say, \"Because I can't keep every demand of God, why even try?\" James reminds us that if we have broken just one, we are sinners. We can't decide to keep part of God's law and ignore the rest. You can't break the law a little bit; if you have broken it at all, you need Christ to pay for your sin. Measure yourself, not someone else, against God's standards. Ask for forgiveness where you need it, then renew your effort to put your faith into practice.",
