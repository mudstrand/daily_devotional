FULL CORRECTED TEXT:
"Paul writes in Philippians "Do not be anxious." In one sense this is like telling a person with a bad head cold no to sniffle and sneeze. Or maybe its more like telling a wino to lay off the booze or a compulsive gambler to stay away from the casino. Is anxiety a disease or an addiction? Maybe it is something of both. Partly, perhaps, because you can't help it, and partly because for some dark reason you choose not to help it.

"Most generally acts of hope expose themselves to ridicule because they seem impractical, failing to conform to visible reality. BUT in fact they are reality that is being constructed but is not yet visible. Hope is what commits us to actions that connect us with God. Often what we call hoping is often only wishing. We want things we think are impossible, but we have better sense than to spend money or commit our lives to them. Biblical hope, though, is an act. Hope acts on conviction that God will complete the work that He has begun even when the appearances, especially when the appearances, oppose it. Hope-determined actions participate in the future that God is bringing into being. However these acts are rarely spectacular. Usually they take place outside sacred settings. Hardly ever are they viewed to be significant by outsiders. It is not easy to act in hope because most of the immediate evidence is against it. Yes it takes courage to act in hope.

We should let praise be a part of the incense we bring before God in our quiet time. In the Psalms, we see what a large place praise ought to have in the spiritual life. There are more than sixty Psalms of praise, becoming more frequent as the book draws to its close. We should study the Psalms more closely until our whole heart and life are one continual song of praise."

"Repentance is not merely mouthing the words "I"m sorry." Sometimes those words mean "I'm sorry that I got caught." "I'm sorry that I am being punished." "I'll be more careful next time so that I get away with it." Or they can mean "I truly feel bad that I hurt you and I will not do it again." The repentance which Jesus calls us to, is far more than a superficial feeling. The word Jesus uses means a change of heart. Like with the cheating tax collector Zacchaeus. Repentance means admitting our sins, recognizing the hurt we have caused to our neighbor and Jesus, then making amends for those sins, and then fighting against them, (or turning from them). We need to understand the connect between repentance and salvation. It is only those who truly repent of their sins that will find in the gospel the good news they need. To those who don't feel their sins, repentance is only a term, not a treasure. Before we can enjoy Jesus' forgiveness, we need to understand His call to repentance."

Sometimes those words mean "I'm sorry that I got caught," "I'm sorry that I am being punished," "I'll be more careful next time so that I get away with it." Or they can mean "I truly feel bad that I hurt you and I will not do it again." The repentance which Jesus calls us to is far more than a superficial feeling. The word Jesus uses means a change of heart. Like with the cheating tax collector Zacchaeus, repentance means admitting our sins, recognizing the hurt we have caused to our neighbor and Jesus, then making amends for those sins, and then fighting against them (or turning from them). We need to understand the connection between repentance and salvation. It is only those who truly repent of their sins that will find in the gospel the good news they need. To those who don't feel their sins, repentance is only a term, not a treasure. Before we can enjoy Jesus' forgiveness, we need to understand His call to repentance."

""Who wants to go to heaven if all they do there is sing?" asked a teenager. The Scriptures do speak about believers singing in heaven. When we look closely, though, we note that it is not so much the singing that is stressed, but to Whom and about what we will sing. As the bodies of the Egyptian soldiers wash ashore, the Israelites sang. Let out of Egypt by the Lord, they had camped, rejoicing beside the Red Sea. Of course we know it wasn't long before their balloon of joy popped. Pharaoh's troops had been right behind them. The situation looked hopeless till the Lord led them to safety through the dammed up waters of the sea. Those walls of water became a weapon wiping out Egypt's strike force. It was this victory that the Israelites sang about. When will the world learn that fighting with God is no contest? Or Better still when will we learn? The more we are assured of His victory, the more we will be ready to sing to Him."

"In the following verses the psalmist writes about the fear of earthquakes and such. Today people fear terrorist attacks and the economy crumbling and such. But the psalmist says even if the world ends, we need not fear. In the face of complete destruction, the writer expressed a quiet confidence in God's ability to save him. Yes, it does seem impossible to consider the end of the world without becoming consumed by fear but the Bible is clear ~ God is our refuge even in the midst of total destruction. He is not merely a temporary retreat: He is our eternal refuge and can provide strength in any circumstance."

"The Corinthians' pure and simple devotion to Christ was being threatened by false teaching. Paul did not want the believers to lose their simple-minded love for Christ. Keeping Christ first in our life can be very difficult when we have so many distractions threatening to sidetrack our faith. Just as Eve lost her focus by listening to the serpent, we, too, can lose our focus by letting our life become overcrowded and confused. Is there anything that weakens your commitment to keep Christ first in your life? Let us minimize any and all distractions that threaten our devotion to Christ."

But if we do not examine closely past history, we will fall to the same mistakes."

""The Lord's plans stand firm forever." Are you frustrated by the inconsistencies you see in others or even yourself? God is completely trustworthy—His intentions never change. There is a promise that whatever is good and perfect comes to us from the Creator who never changes (James 1:17). When you wonder if there is anyone you can trust, remember that God is completely consistent. Let Him counsel you."

But as Christians, we, like David, should ask God to fight our battles for us. He will clear our name in the eyes of those who really matter."

"If you read the first 15 verses of Psalm 38, you will notice that David poured out his struggles and complaint to God. The answer for our destructive foolishness is to grasp the wisdom of God. (Proverbs 9:10) reminds us, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding." Only by allowing God to transform us can we overcome the foolish decisions that cause us so much trouble. With His loving guidance, we can follow the pathway of godly wisdom."

"The quiet procedure of Jesus is so different from the publicity-seeking actions of many would-be reformers and crusaders. Matthew records the Messianic prophecy of Isaiah, "He will not quarrel or cry out; no one will hear His voice in the streets . . . till He leads justice to victory" (Matthew 12:19-20). The Messiah is presented as the Servant who, without self-promotion and fanfare, quickly, gently, and tenderly did His work of healing the sick and nurturing faith. Are we like that?"

One of the children whispered to her, "Mother, what do those do who have no cellar door to put up in front of them?" Have you ever thanked God for your many blessings and prayed for those who have less than you?"

Ash Wednesday reminds us of our mortality (ashes to ashes, dust to dust) and our sinfulness, but also that our mortality and sin have been conquered through the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. Our humanity and our sinfulness have been conquered in Jesus, and we are free."

But Jesus reminded the Pharisee, and He reminds us, that when we feel overwhelmed by commands and rules, we can come back to the core truth. Our God wants to be in a relationship with us. Because of Jesus, that relationship is restored. We never go wrong when we pour our hearts, souls, and minds into love for our Lord. Jesus said, "This is the greatest command.""

"Even though we start out with good intentions, sometimes our faith falters. This doesn't mean we have failed. When Peter's faith faltered, he reached out to Christ, the only one who could help. He was afraid, but he still looked to Christ. When you are apprehensive about the troubles around and doubt Christ's presence or ability to help, remember that He is always with you and is the only one who can really help. Don't look at the storms of life, but look to Jesus, and He will rescue you."

This is possible only for those who give themselves fully to God, because only He can deliver us from natural selfishness. We must trust the Holy Spirit to help us show love to those for whom we may not feel love."

Jesus Christ came into the world and into our hearts on the bridge of faith built by the Holy Spirit, through the Gospel, for the purpose of saving us from sin and death.The Redeemer took our attention away from the trifles of the world, from man’s gaudy lights which keep us from seeing God’s Sun, in our pursuit of selfish interests and from being “busy here and there.” Instead, He wants us to focus our attention on the treasures of His Word and the joy of serving Him in His Kingdom. Ask Jesus, your priceless Treasure, your truest Friend, to keep you always near Him."

"Dear to the God are those who are ever green, and ever bearing. He blesses them and makes them a blessing to many. The Lord cautions us regarding people who seem like dead trees, without foliage or fruit. He does not want us to cut them from the membership of the church. He tells us to remember that He will with the sunshine of grace, nurture them and cause them to grow in faith and bear spiritual fruit again. Through our Baptism, God has grafted us to Him. He causes our faith to live and make us “trees of righteousness.” He sent His Son, Jesus Christ to die on a tr ee and to earn our righteousness."

Here Sol omon tells how his father, David, encouraged him to seek wisdom when he was young see (I kings 2:1-9) for David’s charge to his son. This encourage ment may have prompted Solomon to ask God for an understanding mind above everything else (I Kings 3:9). Wisdom can be passed from parents to children, from generation to generation. Ultim ately, of course, all wisdom comes from God, parents can only urge their children to turn to Him. If your parent never taught you in this way, you can learn from the Scriptures, and then create a legacy of wisdom as you teach your own children."

"Loneliness is everywhere—many people feel cut off and alienated from others. Being in a crowd just makes people more aware of their isolation. We all need friends who will stick close, listen, care, and offer help when it is needed—in good times and bad. A friend is a push when you are stopped, a guide when you are searching, a song when you are glad, a word when you are lonely, a smile when you are sad."

Even the average person can spend an inheritance or a paycheck with lightning speed and have little to show for it. Don't spend your time chasing fleeting earthly treasures. Instead, store up treasure in heaven, for such treasures will never be lost. (read Luke 12:33, 34 for Jesus' teaching.)"
