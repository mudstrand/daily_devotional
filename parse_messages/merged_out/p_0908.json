    "reflection": "When the church's roof was redone, the contractor discovered that the lightning rods hadn't been properly installed. The rods stood there with heavy wires running down, but they were not attached to anything on the lawn below. So the ground could not absorb the charge which never reached it. The lightning of God's just anger over sin had to strike. That's what justice means. If His anger were to hit sinners, they'd be fried to a crisp in the fires of hell. So God in His love provided a lightning rod system for us, He deflected the punishment for sin from us to Jesus. How foolish for unbelievers to think they can ground God's lightning strikes for sin! How blessed are those who are connected by faith's wire to Jesus!",
