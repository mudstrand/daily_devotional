But of course we know that is wishful thinking, So let us look at some of the advantages that the Bible says about having trials. Lets look at James 1 beginning with verse 2 Dear brothers and sisters, whenever trouble comes your way, let it be an opportunity for joy. James doesn't say If trouble comes your way but whenever it does. James assumes that we will have troubles and that it is possible to profit from them. The point here is not to pretend to be happy when we face pain but to have a positive outlook (Let it be an opportunity for joy) verse 3, 4 goes on to say: For when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow. So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully developed, you will be strong in character. We can't fully know the depth of our character until we see how we react under pressure. It is easy to be kind and lovable towards others when everything is going well, but can we still be kind when others are treating us unfairly. The reason we have trials is that God wants to make us mature and complete, not to keep us from pain. Instead of complaining about our struggles, we should see them as opportunities to grow.",

Now I'm not talking about small in stature--but men who think little, talk little, plan little. they remind us of eagles staked to the ground, there's no soar to them. Their ceiling is zero--and their horizons are pulled in to the hub. I'm not saying that these men are selfish (some of course are). But it's just that they are preoccupied most of the time with their own little area of knowledge. They don't allow their minds to stretch and breathe. They don't think, they just rearrange their prejudices. These people are indifferent to problems other than their own. They have no concern for those things which do not hold a personal reference. They refuse to be bothered!!! We live in times which demand big men. Not men who are big shots (they're useless), but men who are big in heart and mind. Great men! Large-souled men! We need men with a vision--whose feet are on the ground, but whose eyes are on the far horizon. Men whose hearts God has touched. Men committed--dedicated to God and His holy and high purpose! Men of integrity!",

He told the young Lawyer, \"Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. Love your neighbor as yourself.\" (Matthew 22:37, 39) Loving God, Loving others, and finding value in ourselves; without a doubt, these three aspects of love are the most effective weapons against the destructive power of low self-worth. Genuine love is a gift we give others. It isn't purchased by their actions or dependent upon our emotions at the moment. It may carry with it strong emotional feelings, but it isn't supported by them. Instead, it is a decision we make on a daily basis that someone is specail and valuable to us. In fact, love for someone often begins to flow once we have made a decision to honor them.",
