GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...Quite often when a man thinks his mind is getting broader,
It's only his conscience stretching...(see Titus 1:15)

Our Meditation for Today:

The Jews insisted, "We have a law, and according to that law he must die,"
because he claimed to be the Son of God."

When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid, and he went back inside
the palace. "Where do you come from?" he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave 
him no answer.

"Do you refuse to speak to me?" Pilate said. "Don't you realize I have the 
power either to free you or to crucify you?"

Jesus answered, "You would have no power over Me if it were not given to
you from above. Therefore the one who handed Me over to you is guilty of
a greater sin." (Jn. 19:8-11) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Throughout the trail we see that Jesus was in control, not Pilate or the religious leaders.

Throughout the trial Pilate wavered in his opinion of Jesus, the Jewish leaders reacted 
out of hatred and anger, but Jesus remained composed. He knew the truth, He knew God's
plan, and He knew the reason for His trial...

Despite the pressure and the persecution, Jesus remained unmoved. It was really Pilate 
and the religious leaders who were on trial, not Jesus....

If you are ever questioned or ridiculed because of your faith, remember that while you may 
be on trial before your accusers, they are on trial before God...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I am so thankful that I have never been ridiculed for my faith,
but if the time ever comes when I am, I pray that I would remain faithful no matter what
the consequences. I pray that I would remember what You went through for Me...Amen.

Keep looking up, for strength in times of trial and tribulation...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
