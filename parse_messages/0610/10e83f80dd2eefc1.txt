GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...Our days are identical suitcases, all the same size, but some 
people can pack more into them than others...(see Eph. 5:15, 16)

Our Meditation for Today:

Finally Pilate handed Him over to them to be crucified. 
so the soldiers took charge of Jesus...

Carrying His own cross, He went out to the place of the 
Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha). Here they 
crucified him, and with Him two others, one on each side 
and Jesus in the middle.

Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross.
It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE 
JEWS...(Jn.19:16-19) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Yes He was crucified, the most horrible death that was ever afflicted
upon another human being

The sign that Pilate had placed about Jesus' head, read, JESUS OF 
NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS, was meant to be a mockery.

A king stripped nearly naked and executed in public view, would seemingly
cause most to believe that He had lost His kingdom forever...

BUT Jesus, who turns the worlds wisdom upside down, was just coming into
His Kingdom. His death and resurrection would strike the deathblow to 
Satan's rule and would establish Jesus' eternal authority over the earth...

Few people reading the sign that bleak afternoon understood it's real meaning,
but the sign was absolutely true...

All was not lost. Jesus was King of the Jews, and the Gentiles, and of the 
whole world...Have you accepted Him as your king???

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, It is hard to phantom the kind of love You showed
the day You took my place on the cross...May my love for You be evident
each and every day...Amen.

Keep looking up and keep plugging away for Jesus...
You're in the Prayers of two who care...
