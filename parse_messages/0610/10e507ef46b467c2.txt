GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought...Men are like fish. Neither would get in trouble
if they would keep their mouth shut...(Pro. 21:23)

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus before the High priest: Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus 
about His disciple and His teaching. 

"I have spoken openly to the world," Jesus replied. "I always taught in the synagogue, 
or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret. 
Why question Me? ask those who heard Me. Surely they know what I said." (Jn 18: 19-21) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Jesus had been teaching, preaching, and healing. These were the three main aspects
of His ministry. 

Teaching showed Jesus' concern for understanding; preaching showed His concern
for commitment; and healing showed His concern for wholeness...His miracles of healing 
authenticated His teaching and preaching, proving He was from God...

Jesus is the authentic Christ--the Savior of the world...Everything He accomplished Him 
to be all that the Bible says He is...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, As I think about Jesus' ordeal and the humiliation that
He endured, the pain that he suffered that the whole world may have their sins 
forgive by the sacrifice that He made, it tugs at my heart. to think that He would
take my sins upon Himself for my redemption; it is hard to phantom such love.
and so I can only accept by faith this great gift and merely say thank You Lord...Amen.

Keep looking up, there is no friend like Jesus...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
