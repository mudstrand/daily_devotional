GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...People know what you are by what they see,
not by what they hear. (See Mt. 5:16)

Our Meditation for Today:

Pilate asked Jesus, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "Is that your
own idea, or did others talk to you about Me."

Pilate answered, Am I a Jew?" It was Your people and Your chief priest who handed
You over to me. What is it You have done?"

Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world. If it were My servant would fight to
prevent My arrest by the Jews. But now My kingdom is from another place. (Jn. 18:33-36) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Pilate asked Jesus a straight forward question, and Jesus answer clearly. Jesus is
a King, but whose Kingdom is not of this world.

There seems to be no question in Pilate's mind that Jesus spoke the truth and was 
innocent of any crime. It also seems apparent that while recognizing the truth, Pilate
chose to reject it.

It is a tragedy when we fail to recognize the truth. It is even a greater tragedy when 
we recognize the truth but fail to heed it.

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Lord, Help me to always recognize the truth and then act upon it.
guide me in Your path of righteousness for Your name sake. Protect 
me from any and all doubts...Amen.

Keep looking up, and He will guide you...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
