GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...A man wrapped up in himself makes
a very small package...(see Pro. 18:2)

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus continues with His prayer, "As You sent Me into the world, I have sent them 
into the world. For them I sanctify Myself, that they too may be truly sanctified." (Jn 17:18, 19) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Jesus didn't ask the Father to take believers out of the world, but instead to use them in the world.

Because Jesus gives us the command to go out into the world, we should not try to escape from
the world, nor should we avoid all relationships with non-Christians...

We are called to be the salt and light (Mt. 5:13-16), and we are to do the work that God sent us to do...

One of His greatest wishes is that we would be truly sanctified, in other words made truly holy...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, Going out into the world to minister to the
unbelieving seems like an awesome task, when we leave You out,
but all things are possible when we include You....Amen.

Keep looking up, and pray for His sanctifying power...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
