GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...The poorest of all men is not the man without
a cent but the man without a dream...Pro. 29:18a

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus said to His disciples, "Though I have been speaking figuratively, a time is coming
when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about My Father...

In that day you will ask in My name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your
behalf...

No, the Father Himself loves you because you have loved Me and have believed that 
I came from God... (Jn. 16:25-27) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Jesus is talking about a new relationship between the believer and God. Before this
people approached God through priests...

After Jesus' resurrection. any believer could approach God directly. A New day has 
dawned and now all believers are priests, talking with God personally and directly.
This is what we see in Heb. 10:17-23.

We approach God, not because of our own merit, but because Jesus, our great 
High Priest, has made us acceptable to God...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the love we see described in John 3:16.
I thank You for the Sacrifice Jesus was willing to make on my behalf on the cross.
I thank You that because of that sacrifice we can now approach You without 
going before a worldly priest...I thank You for, that one on one relationship that
is ours because of Christ...Amen.

Keep looking up, we have a true friend who cares for us...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
