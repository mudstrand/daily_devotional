GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...We make a living by what we get, we make
a life by what we give...(see Acts 20:35).

Our Meditation for Today:

It was the day of preparation of Passover Week, about the sixth hour.
"Here is your king," Pilate said to the Jews.

But they shouted, "Take him away! Take Him away! Crucify him!"

Shall I crucify your king?" Pilate asked.

"We have no king but Caesar," the chief priests answered...(Jn 19:14, 15) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

The Jewish leaders were so desperate to get rid of Jesus that, despite their 
intense hatred for Rome, they shouted "We have no king but Caesar."

How ironic that they claimed that their allegiance was to Rome, rejecting their 
own Messiah! Their own words condemned them, for God was to be their only 
true King, and they had abandoned every trace of loyalty to Him...

The priests had truly lost their reason for existence, instead of turning people to God,
they claimed allegiance to Rome in order to kill the Messiah...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I pray for the strength to always remain faithful to You.
I pray that at the end times when the persecution of all believers takes place, 
I would not go with the crowd, but that I would remain in the light...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will return one day as He said He would...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
