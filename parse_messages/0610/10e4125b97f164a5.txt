GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...It isn't your position that makes you happy or
unhappy, it's your disposition. (see I Tim 6:6, 7)

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus prays for all believers, "My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who
will believe in Me through their message." (Jn. 17:20) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

The unity that Jesus is praying for is not organizational unity but spiritual unity...

His prayer is for all those who will follow Him, including you and others you know...

He also prayed for unity in (17:11), protection from the evil one (17:15), and holiness (17:17)...

Knowing that Jesus prayed for us should give us confidence as we work for the Kingdom...\

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for this intercessory prayer.
I thank You for the assurance it brings that you truly love us.
I thank You for the confidence it gives that You care and are
watching over us and that we have protection from the evil one...Amen.

Keep looking up, He wants to bless you today...
You're in the prayers of Two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
