GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...A man is rich according to what he is, 
not according to what he has...(see Pro. 13:7)

Our Meditation for Today:

When He had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished."
With that He bowed His head and gave up His spirit. (Jn. 19:30)

Our Thought for Today:

Until this time a complicated system of sacrifices had atoned for sins...

Sin separates people from God, and only through the sacrifice of an animal,
a substitute, could people be forgiven and become clean before God...

But people sin continually, so frequent sacrifices were required. Jesus however, 
became the final and ultimate sacrifice for sin...

The word (finished) Is the same as (paid in full). Jesus came to finish God's 
work of salvation (Jn. 4:34; 17:4) to pay the full penalty for our sins...

With His death, the complex sacrificial system ended because Jesus took all 
sin upon Himself. Now we can freely approach God because of what Jesus did for us...

Those who believe in Jesus' death and resurrection can live eternally with God and
escape the penalty that comes from sin...

If you have not as of yet personally accepted what Christ did for you on the cross,
you could be playing Russian Roulette with your life...

Let us seek the Lord while He may be found; let us call upon Him while He is near.
Le us forsake our evil ways and thoughts. Let us turn to the Lord and He will have 
mercy us, and our God will freely pardon...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, the creator of all that exists, seen and unseen,
create in me a pure and loving spirit, that I may not sin against thee...Amen.

Keep looking up, keep plugging away for Jesus...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
