GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...The only preparation for tomorrow
is the right use of today...Mt. 6:34

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus prays for Himself "Father, the time has come. Glorify Your Son,
that Your Son may glorify You...

For You granted Him authority over all people that He might give eternal 
life to all those You have given to Him...

Now this is eternal life: that they may know You, the only true God, and 
Jesus Christ, whom You have sent...(Jn 17:1-3) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

I do not know how many times I have been asked, "How do we get eternal life?"

Here Jesus tells us clearly--by knowing God the Father Himself through His Son,
Jesus Christ...

Eternal life requires entering into a personal relationship with God in Jesus Christ.

When we admit our sin and turn away from it, Christ's love lives in us by the Holy Spirit.

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You that there is no more need for sacrifices.
Lord I ask that you would forgive me for the sins I have committed and ask 
that You would help me to turn from them...Thank You once again for the gift 
of eternal life. I pray these things in Jesus name...Amen.

Keep looking up, that you may grow in your relationship with Him...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
