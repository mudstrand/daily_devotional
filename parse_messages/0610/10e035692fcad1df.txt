I agree with the moral of this story!


Mouse Story ... 
A mouse looked through the 

crack in the wall to see the farmer and his wife open a package.

"What food might this contain?" The mouse wondered - 

he was devastated to discover it was a mousetrap.

Retreating to the farmyard, 

the mouse proclaimed the 

warning.

"There is a mousetrap in the house! There is a mousetrap 

in the house!"

The chicken clucked and scratched, raised her head and 

said, "Mr. Mouse, I can tell this is a grave concern to you 

but it is of no consequence to me. 

I cannot be bothered by it."

The mouse turned to the pig and told him, "There is a 

mousetrap in the house! There is a mousetrap in the house!"

The pig sympathized, but said, 

"I am so very sorry, Mr. Mouse, 

but there is nothing I can do about it but pray. 

Be assured you are in my prayers."

The mouse turned to the cow and said, "There is a 

mousetrap in the house! 

There is a mousetrap in the house!"

The cow said, "Wow, Mr. Mouse. 

I'm sorry for you, 

but it's no skin off my nose."

So, the mouse returned to the house, head down and dejected, 

to face the farmer's mousetrap-- alone.

That very night a sound was heard throughout the house -- 

like the sound of a mousetrap catching its prey.

The farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught. In the 

darkness, she did not see it was a venomous snake 

whose tail the trap had caught.

The snake bit the farmer's wife. 

The farmer rushed her 

to the hospital and she returned home with a fever. 

Everyone knows you treat a fever with fresh chicken soup, 

so the farmer took his hatchet to the farmyard for the soup's 

main ingredient.

But his wife's sickness continued, 

so friends and neighbors came 

to sit with her around the clock. 

To feed them, the farmer butchered the pig.

The farmer's wife did not get well; she died. 

So many people came 

for her funeral, the farmer 

had the cow slaughtered to provide enough meat for all of them.

The mouse looked upon it all from his crack in the wall with great sadness.

So, the next time you hear someone is facing a problem and think it doesn't concern you, 

remember -- 

when one of us is threatened, 

we are all at risk.

We are all involved in this journey called life. 

We must keep an eye out 

for one another and make an extra effort to encourage one another.

SEND THIS TO EVERYONE WHO HAS EVER HELPED YOU OUT 

AND LET THEM KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THEY ARE. 

REMEMBER: 

EACH OF US IS A VITAL 

THREAD IN ANOTHER PERSON'S TAPESTRY; 

OUR LIVES ARE WOVEN TOGETHER FOR A REASON.

One of the best things to hold onto in this world is a friend .
