GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...You can accomplish more in one hour with 
God than one lifetime with out Him...Mt. 19:26b

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus said, "A time is coming, and has come, when you will be scattered,
each to his own home. You will leave Me alone. Yet I am not alone, for My 
Father is with Me.

I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have peace. In this world
you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world...(Jn. 16:32, 33) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

As Christians, we should expect continuing tension with an unbelieving
world that is "out of sync" with Christ, His Good News, and His people.

But we can take courage because He will not abandon us...

We can expect our relationship with Christ to produce peace and comfort 
because we are "in sync" with Him...

Let us remember the ultimate victory has already been won, we can claim 
the peace of Christ in the most troublesome times...


Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Lord, I thank you for the promise that You will never leave us 
nor forsake us. I thank You for the peace that passeth all understanding.
I thank You for the victory that You won for us on the cross...Search
my heart O God and see if their be any wicked way in me...Amen.

Keep looking up, and receive His peace...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
