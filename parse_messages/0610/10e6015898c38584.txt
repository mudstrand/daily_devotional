Subject: The U In Jesus

This is very cleverly done.


THE U IN JESUS Before U were thought of or time had begun,
God stuck U in the name of His Son. And each time U pray, you'll see
it's true,You can't spell out JesUs and not include U. You're a pretty big
part of His wonderful name, For U, He was born; that's why He came.
And His great love for U is the reason He died. It even takes U to spell
crUcified. Isn't it thrilling and splendidly grand He rose from the dead,
with U in His plan? The stones split away, the gold trUmpet blew, and this
word resUrrection is spelled with a U. When JesUs left earth at His upward
ascension, He felt there was one thing He just had to mention. Go into the
world and tell them it's true That I love them all - Just like I love U."So
many great people are spelled with a U, Don't they have a right to know
JesUs too? It all depends now on what U will do, He'd like them to know,
But it all starts with U. Will YOU pass it on. When Jesus died on the
cross he was thinking of you! If you are one of the 7% who will stand up
for him, forward this
