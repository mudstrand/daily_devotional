GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...People don't care how much you know
until they know how much you care...(see Phil. 2:3)

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus continues to pray: "I have given them Your Word, and the world has hated them, 
for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world." (Jn 17:14) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

The world has actually hated Christians, since they have come to realize the one true God...

The reason the world hates Christians is because Christian values differ from the wold.

Because Christ's followers don't cooperate with the world by joining in on their sins,
they are living accusations against the world's immorality...

The world follows Satan's agenda, and Satan is the avowed enemy of Jesus and His people...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I pray for the ability to always avoid Satan's
sly tricks...Give me a discerning heart, that I may never stray from
the truth, so that I would always be a living example to each person 
I come into contact with...Amen.

Keep Looking Up, He is seeking faithful followers...
You're in the prayers of two who care....
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
