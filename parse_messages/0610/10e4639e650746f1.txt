GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...It takes more to plow a field than merely turning 
it over in your mind. (see 1 Thess. 4:11, 12)

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus is arrested, "Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck 
the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. (the servants name was Malchus.) 

Jesus commanded Peter, "Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father 
has given Me?" (Jn 18:10, 11) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Trying to protect Jesus, Peter pulled a sword and wounded the high priest's servant.
But Jesus told Peter to put away his sword and allow God's plan to unfold...

At times it is tempting to take matters into our own hands, to force the issue.
Most often such moves lead to sin...

Instead, we must trust God to work out His plan. Think about it, if Peter had had his 
way, Jesus would not have went to the cross, and God's plan of redemption would
have been thwarted...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear heavenly Father, how great it is when we allow Your plans
to run the course. Help me Lord to be more patient, that I may
see Your plan unfold. Help me to put full trust in You. Forgive me
for my impatience and weak faith...Amen.

Keep looking up, put your trust in Him...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
