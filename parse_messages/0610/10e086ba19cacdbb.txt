GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...Even a woodpecker owes his success 
to the fact that he uses his head...(2 Tim 4:5)

Our Meditation for Today:

The disciples were wondering what Jesus meant when he said, 'in a little while
you will see Me no more, and then after a little while you will see Me.' 

Jesus saw that they wanted to ask Him about this, so He said to them, "Are
you asking one another what I meant when I said, 'In a little while you will see
Me no more, and then after a little while you will see Me?' I tell you the truth
you will weep an mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief
will turn to joy."...(Jn. 16:19, 20) NIV 

Our Meditation for Today:

What a contrast between the disciples and the world! The world rejoiced while 
the disciples wept, but the disciple would see Jesus again (in three days) and
rejoice...

The world's values are often the opposite of God's values. This can cause Christians
to feel like misfits...BUT even if life is difficult now, one day we will rejoice...

Keep your eye on the future and on God's promises!!!

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your comforting presence.
I thank You for Your promise to always be with us and Your promise
to hear our prayers. Help me to be more patient with my eye on
the future in expectation of Your return...Amen.

Keep looking up, with your eye on the future...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
