GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...You can easily determine the caliber of a person by the
amount of opposition it takes to discourage him...(see Pro. 24:10)

Our Meditation for Today:

Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman Governor.
By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness the Jews did 
not enter the palace; they wanted to be able to eat the Pass Over...

So Pilate came out to them and asked, "what charges are you bring against this 
man?"

"If He were not a criminal," they said, "we would not have handed Him over to you."
(Jn. 18:28-30) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

It is strange how these Jewish leaders were more concerned about their ceremonial
laws than the were about putting to death an innocent person...

They kept the ceremonial requirements of their religion while harboring murder and
treachery in their hearts...

When asked what the charges were, they couldn't even give an answer...

But is our sin any less, when we neglect to attend worship--or when we neglect to give
thanks, or when we neglect to give to the poor??? Didn't Jesus Himself say what-ever
you do onto the least of these you do to Me???

When we neglect to do these things we are really disobeying our Lord, We may not have 
outright murder in our heart...But being disobedient is the same as saying the Lord's will
is unimportant...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, cleanse my heart of all unrighteousness.
Help me to be more faithful...Restore a right heart in me, that I
may not sin against you...Bless all my e-mail friends and keep
them safe...

Keep looking up, bring your requests to Him...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
