GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...Living would be easier if men showed as much patience 
at home as they do when they are fishing...(see 1 Pet. 3:7b)

Our Meditation for Today:

When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took His clothes, divided them into
four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This
garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom...

"Let's not tear it," they said to one another. ""Let's decide by lot who will get it."
This happened that the scriptures might be fulfill which said,

"They divided my garments among them,
and cast lots for my clothing."

So this is what the soldiers did... (Jn 19:23, 24) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Roman soldiers in charge of the crucified customarily took for themselves
the clothes of the condemned men...

They divided Jesus' clothing, throwing dice to determine who would get His
seamless garment, the most valuable piece of clothing. This fulfilled the prophecy 
in Ps. 22:18.

Are you gambling away your eternal life, by saying "one day" when I get older?
What will happen if the Lord calls before you get any older?

What happens is, you will spend eternity separated from the Lord...

Isa. 55:6 tells us : Seek the Lord while He may be found;
call upon Him while He is near... 

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Lord, I do not wish to gamble away the home 
You have prepared for those who are faithful and just.
Forgive me all my sins, and wash me white as snow.
Guide me in paths of righteousness, for Your name 
sake...Amen.

Keep look up, keep plugging away for Jesus...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
