Body (clean, unformatted):
===================================================================
GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...The difference between ordinary and
extraordinary is that little extra. (see Eccl. 9:10)

Our Meditation for Today:

Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath.
Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath,
they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.

The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been
crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other.

But when they came to Jesus and found that He was already dead, they did not 
break His legs...(Jn. 19:31-33) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

It was against God's law to leave the body of a dead person exposed overnight (see
Deut. 21:23), and it was also against the law to work after Sundown on Friday, when
the Sabbath began...

This is why the religious leaders urgently wanted to get Jesus' body down off the cross
and buried by sundown...

Now these Roman soldiers had lots of experience from many previous crucifixions, so
they knew when a man was dead or alive. So they did not need to break His legs. The
reason for the breaking of the legs was so they could not hold themselves up, because
when they could no longer hold themselves up death came by suffocation in just minutes...

Jesus went through this ordeal so that our sins would be paid in full--That is why He said
"It is finished." There was no longer any need for the sacrifice of animals or anything else.

Jesus' shed blood was sufficient for all time...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, once again I am reminded of Your wonderful love.
I thank You for the assurance of my salvation through faith in Your finished
work on the cross. Forgive me for my sin's of thought, word, and deed. Help
me to walk in the paths of righteousness, for Jesus sake Amen...

Keep looking up, He is the light of the world...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
