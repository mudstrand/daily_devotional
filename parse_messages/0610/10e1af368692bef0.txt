GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...

Jesus' prayer: "I have brought You glory on earth by 
completing the work You gave Me to do...

And now, Father, glorify Me in Your presence with the glory 
I had with You before the world began."...(Jn 17:4, 5) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Before Jesus came to earth, He was one with God...

At this point when His mission on earth was almost finished,
Jesus was asking His Father to restore Him to His original
place of honor and authority...

Jesus resurrection and ascension--and Steven's dying exclamation
(Acts 7:56) gives evidence to the fact that Jesus did return to His
exalted position at the right hand of God...

The fact that this took place is the assurance that a believer will one day
inherit eternal life...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the work that was completed
on Calvary...I thank You that the debt for my sins were paid in full.
Forgive me for my sins of thought word and deed, my sins of omission
and my sins of commission. Help me Lord to walk the paths of righteousness...Amen.

Keep looking up, one day He will return the same way He left...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
