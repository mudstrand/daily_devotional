GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...Temper is what gets most of us in trouble.
Pride is what keeps us there...(see Pro. 16:18, 19)

Our Meditation for Today:

In vs. 11 Jesus assured Pilate that he had no power over Him were it not 
given to him from above...

From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jews kept on shouting,
"If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to 
be a king opposes Caesar."

When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's 
seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic" is Gabbatha) 
(Jn. 19:12, 13) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

These words spoken by the Jews pressured Pilate into allowing Jesus to be
crucified. As the Roman Governor of the area, Pilate was expected to keep
the peace...

Because Rome could not afford to keep large numbers of troops in the outlying
regions, they maintained control by crushing rebellions immediately with brute
force...

Pilate was afraid that reports to Caesar of insurrection in his region would cost him 
his job and perhaps even his life...

When we face a tough decision, we can take the easy way out, or we can stand up
for what is right regardless of the cost. If we know the good we ought to do and
don't do it, we sin (James 4:17)...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, help me to always make the right decisions,
and not take the easy way out. Help me to always stand up for what
is right no matter what the cost. Bless and keep my e-mail friends
safe, let no temptation befall them that is uncommon to man...Amen.

Keep looking up, we have no truer friend then Jesus...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
