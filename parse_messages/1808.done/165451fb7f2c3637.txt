VERSE FOR TODAY:

_People with good sense restrain their anger; they earn_

_esteem by overlooking wrongs. _(Pro. 19:11)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

A quick temper can be like a fire out of control. It can burn us

and everyone else in its path. Anger divides people. It pushes

us into hasty decisions that only causes bitterness and guilt. Yet

anger, in itself, is not wrong. Anger can be a legitimate reaction

to injustice and sin. When you feel yourself getting angry, look

for the cause. Are you reacting to an evil situation that you are

going to set right? Or are you responding to a personal insult?

PRAY FOR TODAY:

Dear heavenly Father, I pray that You will help me control a

quick temper, channel my feelings into effective action so that

I may conquer selfish anger through humility and repentance.

Amen.
