VERSE FOR TODAY:

_When a scoffer is punished, the simple become wise; when a_

_wise man is instructed, he gains knowledge. _(Pro. 21:11)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY.

_"SCOFFER" is someone who stubbornly scorns God's wisdom, _

_"THE SIMPLE WILL LEARN PRUDENCE." _Punishment is a deterrent

for the simple who take warning from the fate of the wicked.

Simple people must actually see what consequences come from

disobedience. this is an indictment to us all, we may know well

enough that lawlessness has its price, but we change our behavior

ONLY when the treat of punishment is near.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that I don't have to be hit in the

head to realize that there are consequences for those whose

behavior is not in tune with Your will. . . Amen.
