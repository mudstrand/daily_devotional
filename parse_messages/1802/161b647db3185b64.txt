VERSE FOR TODAY:

_"We who worship God in the Spirit, are the only ones who are_

_truly circumcised. We put no confidence in human efforts. Instead,_

_we boast about what Christ Jesus has done for us." _(Phil. 3:3)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

It is easy to place more emphases on human effort then on eternal
faith,

but God values the attitude of our heart above all else. Don't judge
people's

spirituality by their fulfillment of duties or by their level of
human activity.

And don't think that you satisfy God by feverishly doing His work.
God

notices all you do for Him and will reward you for it, BUT only if it
comes

as a loving response to His free gift of salvation.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Heavenly Father, I truly thank You for what Christ Jesus has
done

for us. I pray that the attitude of my heart would always be pleasing
to

You. . . Amen.
