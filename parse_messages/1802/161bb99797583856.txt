VERSE FOR TODAY:

Verses 4-6 give us some insight as to Paul's prior life before he

came face to face with Christ, on the road as he was on his way

to arrest more Christians. He was so sure of his self righteousness

that he was willing to match his life with the life of any Pharisees.

After his meeting with Christ a definite change took place in him.

this is his statement after meeting with Christ, "What a priceless

gain of knowing Christ."

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

Is this your testimony? Or like the old Paul are you depending

upon your good works? A religion without faith in the finished

work of Christ is a religion without any hope of eternal life. . .

PRAYER FOR TODAY.

I thank You Lord, for the promise of eternal life that is ours

by faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. . . Amen.
