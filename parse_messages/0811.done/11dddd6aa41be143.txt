First:
Marcie and I want to wish each and everyone 
a Happy and blessed Thanksgiving...

Second:
Please hold all e-mails to me after Mon. the first 
of Dec. until further notice, as I will be going in 
for surgery on the second of Dec. for rotor cuff 
surgery on my right shoulder.

The doctor said it will be a long process in healing...

So:
I am going to take this opportunity to wish each of you 
a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year too.

God bless each and everyone...

Al & Marcie
