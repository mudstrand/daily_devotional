11/27/08~~~(food for thought)~~~"No duty is more urgent than giving thanks"
(author unknown)

Being it is Thanksgiving Day I have decided to not finish up
with chap. 4 of Eph. today instead I want to share Ps. 7:17.

I will give thanks to the Lord because of His righteousness
and I will sing praise to the name of the Lord Most High. (Ps. 7:17) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Being thankful and saying so helps us take the more simple approach 
to life. We can all find plenty to complain about if we look for it, but if
it does no good, why do it?

God tells us in His Word not to complain, or find fault, or murmur about 
anything (see Phil. 2:14). what He says is that when we grumble and gripe,
in reality, we are finding fault with Him...

The apostle Paul teaches that we should not be anxious about anything,
but in all things by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, we should let
our requests be made known unto God and only then the peace that
passes all understanding shall be ours (Phil 4:6, 7)...

Having a thankful heart shows God we are ready for a new level of 
blessings. Thanksgiving should be a part of the lifestyle of one who 
genuinely worships and praises God...

Complaining all week then going to church and singing a few songs on 
Sunday and calling it worship does not make it so. We should not merely 
worship. We should be a worshiper who worships God in spirit and truth, 
which is His will (Jn. 4:24)...

Let us remember that an attitude of gratitude certainly helps to simplify
life. It keeps our minds free for thoughts that minister peace and joy,
rather than turmoil. It also keeps our conversation going in a direction 
that creates a positive atmosphere everyone can enjoy...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for all the times my
attitude has been less than grateful. Help me to remember
that thanksgiving is more than a one day affair. Thank 
You for each and every person who will give serious thought
to this message, and share the reason they are thankful
with someone else...Amen.

Keep looking up, in thankfulness...
You are in the prayers of two who are thankful for you...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
