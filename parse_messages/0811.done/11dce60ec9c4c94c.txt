Just to let them know we care!

When doing your Christmas cards this year, take
one card and send it to the address below. 

If we pass this on and everyone sends one card, 
think of how many cards these wonderful special 
people who have sacrificed so much would get.

When you are making out your Christmas card list
this year, please include the following:

A Recovering American Soldier
c/o Walter Reed Army Medical Center
6900 Georgia Avenue,NW
Washington,D.C. 20307-5001

If you approve, please pass it on.
