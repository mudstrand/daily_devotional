11/04/08~~~(food for thought)~~~Place your hope in God's hands...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Surely you have heard about the administration of God's
grace that was given to me for you...

That is the ministry made known to me by revelation, as
I have already written briefly...(Eph. 3:2, 3) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

"God's grace," that was given to Paul refers to the special 
stewardship, trust, or commitments that Paul had been given.
He had been assigned the specail work of preaching the Good
News to the Gentiles...

All who have put their hand in God's have been given a similar
task, that is spreading the Good News. The "Great Commission"
Is to "Go". All to often we think the job is done when we place a 
poster in a public place inviting the public to come to a special 
meeting...

This is well and good, but, our life should be a walking poster
so that people would see Christ's light being reflected through 
us... Let your light so shine that all would see Christ in you
and come to the knowledge of the truth...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that my life would a
reflection of Your love which would give hope to 
those I come into contact with. Guide me in paths 
of righteousness...Amen.

Keep looking up, God is still giving hope...
You are in the prayers of two who care
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
