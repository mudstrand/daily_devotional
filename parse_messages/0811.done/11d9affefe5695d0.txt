11/14/08~~~(food for thought)~~~We are all one in Christ...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

There is one body and one Spirit - just as you were called to
one hope when you were called - one Lord, one faith, one baptism;

One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and
in all...(Eph. 4:4-6) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul says, "We are one body." Unity does not just happen,
we have to work at it. To often differences among people
can lead to division, but this should not be true in the church...

Instead of concentrating on what divides us, we should remember
what unites us: one body, one Spirit, one future, one Lord, one
faith, one baptism, one God!

Have you attempted to appreciate people who are different than
you? Can you see how their differing gifts and viewpoints can help
the church as it does God's work???

Learn to enjoy the way we as members of Christ's body complement 
one another...

For further thoughts on this subject see (I Cor. 12:12, 13)

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, help me to remember the oneness 
that is to be among all Your children. Help me realize how
differing gifts can help to further Your Kingdoms work. I pray 
for Godly wisdom in Jesus Name...Amen.

Keep looking up, He gives freely to all who ask...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
