Thank you Donna!!!

I am forwarding this to my 50 morning devotional recipients
because we need to began to pray that this country would 
become unified under the blood of Christ...

Subject: Read John 13-16


Now the elections are over and it is time to think whose will this is. We all prayed for our candidate and maybe the one we prayed for didn't get it. I plead with you now, please pray for for the president elect and his future cabinate. Remember that it is a government for the people and by the people. What a wonderful time to be alive. Christ still reigns! Praise the Lord!

(John 15:10-11) If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love; even as I have kept My Father's Commandments and abide in His love. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.

Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself (Leviticus 19:18)) was the Old Command; but, no such imperfect reflecion of love as this is given in the New Command: As I have loved you (John 13:34). This New Commandment encourages us to examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith (ll Cor. 13:5). If we fail this love test and we have hate, lust, or an unforgiving attitude toward another, it is because we have not understood Christ's love and will face the tormentors (Matt 18:34-35).

Thought for today: If Jesus disciples love Him, they also will love all who are children of the Heavenly Father-members of one great spiritual family.

Prayer suggestion: Rely upon the Lord at all times; He is your refuge (Psa 62:8)

God is in control and a mighty fortress. Nothing passes Him by. He knows all. Wow What a Savior!
Donna 

Let us all say Amen...
