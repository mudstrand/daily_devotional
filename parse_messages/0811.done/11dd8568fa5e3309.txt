Our Bible Verses for Today:

Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths,
but only what is helpful for building others up according to
their needs, that it may benefit those who listen...

And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you
are sealed for the day of redemption...

Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander,
along with every form of malice...

Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other,
just as in Christ God forgave you...(Eph. 4:29-32) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

We need to remember that we can bring sorrow to the Holy Spirit
by the way we live. Paul warns against unwholesome language,
bitterness, improper us of anger, harsh words, slander, and bad
attitudes toward others...

Instead of acting that way, we should be forgiving, just as God
has forgiven us. Are you bringing sorrow or pleasing God with 
your attitude and actions...

Let us act in love toward our brothers and sisters in Christ, just 
as God acted in love by sending His Son to die for our sins...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for my sins of thought
word and deed. Help me to be more loving and forgiving.
Help me to move from hate to love in my attitude toward 
others...Amen.

Keep looking up, seeking a more loving attitude...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
