Heart Attacks And Drinking Warm Water 

This is a very good article. Not only about the warm water after your meal, 
but Heart Attacks .. The Chinese and Japanese drink hot tea with their 
meals, not cold water, maybe it is time we adopt their drinking habit 
while eating. 

For those who like to drink cold water, this article is applicable to you. 
It is nice to have a cup of cold drink after a meal. However, the cold 
water will solidify the oily stuff that you have just consumed. It will slow down 
the digestion. Once this 'sludge' reacts with the acid, it will break down 
and be absorbed by the intestine faster than the solid food. It will line 
the intestine. Very soon, this will turn into fats and lead to cancer. 
It is best to drink hot soup or warm water after a meal. 

Common Symptoms Of Heart Attack... 

A serious note about heart attacks - You should know that not every heart 
attack symptom is going to be the left arm hurting .. Be aware of intense 
pain in the jaw line. You may never have the first chest pain during the 
course of a heart attack. Nausea and intense sweating are also common 
symptoms. 60% of people who have a heart attack while they are asleep do 
not wake up. Pain in the jaw can wake you from a sound sleep. Let's be careful 
and be aware. The more we know, the better chance we could survive. 

Read this and send this article to all your friends you care about.
