11/22/08~~~(food for thought)~~~Let us live as Children of the light...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

(Paul's further thought about those who live without the light)
They are darkened in their understanding and separated from
the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to
the hardening of their hearts...

Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to
sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a
continual lust for more...

You however, did not come to know Christ that way...
(Eph 4:18, 19) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

People should always be able to see a difference between 
Christians and non-Christians because of the way Christians 
live. We are to live full of light (5:8)...

Paul told the Ephesians to leave behind the old life of sin, 
since they were followers of Christ. Living the Christian life 
is a process. Even though we have a new nature, we don't
automatically think all good thoughts and express all right
attitudes when we become new people in Christ...

BUT if we keep listening to God, we will be changing all the 
time. As you look back over last year, do you see a process 
of change for the better in your thoughts, attitudes, and actions?

Even though change may be slow, it comes as you trust in God
to change you...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to improve my thoughts,
attitudes, and actions, so that there would be a noticeable 
difference in me. May the world see Christ's light shining
in me...Amen.

Keep looking up, let His light shine through you...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
