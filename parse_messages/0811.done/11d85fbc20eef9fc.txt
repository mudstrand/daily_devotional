11/10/08~~~(food for thought)~~~God has won the Battle for us...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

His (God's) intent was that now, through the church, the manifold
wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities 
in the heavenly realms,

according to His eternal purpose which He accomplished in Christ
Jesus our Lord...

In Him and through faith in Him we may approach God with freedom
and confidence...(Eph. 3:10-12) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

It is an awesome privilege to be able approach God with freedom 
and confidence. Most of us would be apprehensive in the presence
of a powerful ruler. But thanks to Christ, by faith we can enter directly
into God's presence through prayer...

We can have the assurance that we will be welcomed with open
arms because we are God's children through our union with Christ.
Don't be afraid of God. Talk to Him about everything. He is waiting
to hear from you...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the free pass 
we have been given into Your presence through Jesus
Christ Your Son. I thank You for the victory that is mine
through His death and resurrection from the grave...Amen.

Keep looking up, there is victory in Jesus...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
