11/25/08~~~(food for thought)~~~Lying destroys relationships...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak 
truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all members of one 
body...

"In your anger do not sin". Do not let the sun go down while 
you are still angry,

and do not give the devil a foothold...(Eph.4:25-27) NIV

Our lesson for Today:

Now the Bible does not tell us that we should not feel angry,
BUT it does point out that it is important to handle anger properly.

If vented thoughtlessly anger can hurt others and destroy our 
relationships. IF bottled up inside, it can cause us to become
bitter and destroy us from within...

Paul tells us to deal with our anger immediately in a way that builds
relationships rather than destroying them. If we nurse our anger, 
we will give Satan an opportunity to divide us...

Are you angry with someone right now? What could you do to 
resolve your differences? Is it a sense of false pride???

Don't let another day end before you begin to work on mending
you relationship...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to give up all false pride.
Help me to put aside any differences I have against another
person, so that I can truly begin to work on mending my
relationships. For You say if we are unwilling to forgive our
Father will not forgive us...Amen.

Keep looking up, for the strength to forgive...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
