11/28/08~~~(food for thought)~~~Be satisfied with what you have...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content
with what you have, because God has said, "Never will I 
leave you: never will I forsake you." (Heb. 13:5) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

I believe that our culture has created an epidemic of coveting
what everyone else has. we seem to crave more and more,
yet we do not enjoy what we already possess...

A simple person is a satisfied person; they don't crave more of 
anything, but they do thoroughly enjoy what they have. They trust 
that more will come in due time...

Does "more" truly have the ability to make us happy as the world
wants us to believe? The answer is no! In fact, the more we have,
the more work we must do to take care of it. We may think "more" 
makes life easier, but in reality, it often complicates the day to day...

The tenth commandment tells us not to covet; we aren't to want what
others have. Paul says in (Phil 4:11) that he learn how to become
content no matter what his circumstances were. Even hearing that
statement reminds me of simplicity and ministers comfort to me...

There is nothing wrong with having things, but it is wrong to lust after
them. When we feel we cannot be happy without something, we are
lusting after it...

Let me leave you with this thought: 
"We should develop the habit of asking God for what we want, and believe
He will give it to us, if and when, it is right..."

This simple approach to life sets us free to enjoy life...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to be content with the simple 
things of life. Forgive me for working harder at acquiring more 
things than I do at giving thanks for the things I already have...Amen.

Keep looking up, in contentment ~ for contentment
is not the fulfillment of what you want, but the
realization of how much you already have."

You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
