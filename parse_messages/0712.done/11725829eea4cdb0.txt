Have a Good day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~When it is dark enough, men see the stars...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple 
and that God's Spirit lives in you?

If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him;
for God's temple is sacred, and you are that temple...
(I Cor. 3:16, 17) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Now just as our bodies are the "Temple of the Holy Spirit"
(I Cor. 6:19), the local church or Christian community is
God's temple...

Just as the Jews' temple in Jerusalem was not to be destroyed,
the church is not to be spoiled and ruined by divisions,
controversy, or other sins as members come together
to worship God...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, help protect my body from sin, 
I do not want to destroy Your temple. Create a clean 
heart in me...Amen.

Keep looking up, as He forgives our sins He cleans His temple...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
