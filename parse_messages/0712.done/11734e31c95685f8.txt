Hi!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Be a helper to the helpless...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Don't take pride in following a particular leader. Everything
belongs to you...

Paul, Apollis and Peter; the whole wold and life and death; 
the present and the future. Everything belongs to you,

and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God...
(I Cor. 3:21-23) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul's says that both life and death are ours. While non-believers
are victims of life, swept along by its current and wondering if
there is any meaning to it, believers can use life well because
they understand its true purpose...

Non-believers can only fear death. For believers, however, 
death holds no terrors because Christ has conquered all fears
(see I Jn. 4:18).

Death is only the beginning of eternal life with God...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for revealing the purpose 
of life to me. Forgive me for my anxious thoughts. Help
me to be more sensitive to Your Holy Spirit's leading...Amen.

Keep looking up, do what you can, leave the rest to God...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
