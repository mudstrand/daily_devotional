Have a Nice Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~He knows our every thought...

Our Bible Verse for today:
(Let us look at verse 10 again along with verse 11)

I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that all of you agree with one another so that there be no divisions
among you and that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought.

My brothers, some from Chloe's household have informed me that 
there are quarrels among you...(I Cor. 1:10-11) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

To "let there be harmony" or to allow no "divisions" and to 
"be of one mind, united in thought and purpose" does not 
require everyone to believe exactly the same...

There is a difference between have opposing viewpoints and 
being divisive...

It is very seldom that a group of people will completely agree 
on every issue, but we can still work together harmoniously
if we agree on what truly matters ~ Jesus Christ is Lord of all...

In your church, speak and behave in a way that will reduce
arguments and increase harmony ~~

Petty differences should never divide Christians...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your love and mercy!
Instill in me a loving spirit ~ a Christ-like attitude ~ Help me
be more concerned about the needs and feelings of others
and less concerned about what I want. Bless all my e-mail
friends with good health and safety...Amen.

Keep looking up ~ with an attitude of love...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
