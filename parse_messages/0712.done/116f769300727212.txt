Have a Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Seek first approval from God...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul says, So neither he who plants nor waters is anything, 
but only God, who makes things grow...

The man who plants and the man who waters have one purpose,
and each will be rewarded according to his own labor...

For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's 
building...(I Cor 2:7-9) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

We need to remember that God's work involves may different
individuals with a variety of gifts and abilities...

There are no superstars in this task, only team members performing
their own special roles. We can become useful members of God's 
team by setting aside our desires to receive glory for what we do...

Don't seek the praise that comes from people ~ it is comparatively
worthless. Instead seek approval from God...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, help me to be a better team player.
Remove from me any pride that would cause me to seek the
praise of my peers. Help me to remember to build others up
for their humble service...Amen.

Keep looking up, you are in God's plan...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
