Have a Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought) Our anger often reveals the worst in us...

Our Bible verses for Today:

Neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only
God, who makes things grow...

The man who plants, and the man who waters have one purpose,
and each will be rewarded according to his own labor...

For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's building.
(I Cor. 3:7-9) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

When you really think about it God's work involves many different 
individuals with a variety of gifts and abilities. There are no superstars
in this task...

There are only team members performing their own special roles.
There is no reason we cannot become useful members of God's team,

All we need to do is set aside our desire to receive glory for what we do.
Don't seek the praise that comes from people ~ It is comparatively worthless.
Instead seek approval from God...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to always seek to serve you
according to Your will. Help me to realize the gifts You have 
given me to serve as a team member...Amen.

Keep looking up, seeking to serve Him...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
