Have a Nice Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~We are God's children...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual but as worldly mere infants
in Christ...

I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed,
you are still not ready... 

You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you,
are you not worldly? are you not acting like mere men? (I Cor. 3:1-3) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul called the Corinthians babes in their Christian life, because they were 
not yet spiritually healthy and mature...

The proof of this was that they quarreled like children, allowing divisions
to distract them...

Immature Christian are "worldly" control by their own desires; mature believers
are in tune with God's desires...

How much influence do your desires have on your life? Your goal should 
be to let God's desires be yours. Being control by your own desires will
stunt your Christian growth...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to follow Your desires,
that I might grow in my Christian faith. Help me to live in 
union with other Christians. Forgive me for allowing my
own desires to take control of my life...Amen.

Keep looking up, seek first His will...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
