Heart attack and drinking warm water!! 
Please read this and send it to those you care about. 
Heart Attacks and drinking warm water.... 

This is a very good article. Not only about the warm water after your 
meal, but about heart attacks. This makes sense.. The Chinese and 
Japanese drink hot tea with their meals...not cold water...maybe it is 
time we adopt their drinking habit while eating!!! 

Nothing to lose, everything to gain... 

For those who like to drink cold water, this article is applicable to 
you It is nice to have a cup of cold drink after a meal. However, the 
cold water will solidify the oily stuff that you have just consumed. It 
will slow down the digestion. Once this 'sludge' reacts with the acid, 
it will break down and be absorbed by the intestine faster than the 
solid food. It will line the intestine. Very soon, this will turn into 
fats and lead to cancer. It is best to drink hot soup or warm water 
after a meal. 

A serious note about heart attacks: You should know that not every heart 
attack symptom is going to be the left arm hurting. Be aware of intense 
pain in the jaw line. 

You may never have the first chest pain during the course of a heart 
attack. Nausea and intense sweating are also common symptoms. 60% of 
people who have a heart attack while they are asleep do not wake up. 
Pain in the jaw can wake you from a sound sleep. Let's be careful and be 
aware. The more we know, the better chance we could survive... 

A cardiologist says if everyone who gets this mail sends it to 10 
people, you can be sure that we'll save at least one life. Read this ... 
It could save YOUR life !! 

Please be a true friend and send this article to all your friends you 
care about !
