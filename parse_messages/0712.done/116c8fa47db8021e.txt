Have a Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~God knows our every thought, word, and deed...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

I can never stop thanking God for all the generous gifts He has given you,
now that you belong to Christ Jesus...

He has enriched your church with the gifts of eloquence and every kind 
of knowledge...

This shows that what I told you about Christ is true...(I Cor. 1:4-6) NLT

Our Lesson for Today:

In this letter you will find that Paul wrote some strong words to the
Corinthians ~ but he begins on a positive note of thanksgiving...

He affirms their privilege of belonging to the Lord and receiving
His generous gifts ~ the power to speak out for Him ~ and understand
His truth...

When we must correct others, it helps to begin by affirming what 
God has already accomplished in them...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, give me wisdom like Paul shows here,
help me to not only see the negative things in peoples lives but
also the positive things ~ help me to always see the positive
first. Bless my e-mail friends with good health and safety...Amen.

Keep looking up, and observe the positive, 
and God will take care of the negative...
You are in the Prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
