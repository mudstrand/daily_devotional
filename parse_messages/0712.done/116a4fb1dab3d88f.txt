Have a Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~God is with us in our weakness (I Cor. 2:4)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

It has always been my ambition to preach the Gospel where Christ
was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else's 
foundation...

Rather, as it is written: "Those who were not told about Him will
see, and those who have not heard will understand."

This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you...(Ro. 15:20-22) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul's natural desire was to visit the church at Rome, but he had
delayed his visit because he had heard many good reports about
the believers there and knew they were doing well on their own...

It was more important for him to preach in areas that had not yet
heard the Good News...

Do you reach out as you should ~ or ~ do you restrict your
fellowship to other believers...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, open the door to someone today
that needs to hear the Gospel. Guide me down the path
you want me to travel...Amen.

Keep looking up, and He will lead to the one He has prepared...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
