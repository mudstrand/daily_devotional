We have heard it before but a good reminder.






from commentary by Paul Harvey 



This Pastor Has Guts 

and may the Good Lord Bless his ministries



It seems prayer still upsets some
people. Please read....



When
Minister Joe Wright was asked to open the new session of the Kansas
Senate, everyone was expecting the usual generalities, but this
is what they heard;



"Heavenly Father,

We come before you today
to ask for your forgiveness and
to seek your direction and guidance.

We know Your Word says,
"Woe to those who call evil good"

But that is exactly what we have done.

We have lost our spiritual equilibrium
and reversed our values.

We have exploited the poor
And called it the lottery.

We have rewarded laziness
And called it welfare.

We have killed our unborn
and called it choice.

We have shot abortionists
and called it justifiable.

We have neglected to discipline our children
And called it building self esteem.

We have abused power
And called it politics.

We have coveted our neighbor's Possessions
and called it ambition.

We have polluted the air with profanity and Pornography
and called it Freedom of speech and expression.

We have ridiculed the time Honored values of our Forefathers
and called it enlightenment.

Search us, Oh, God,

And know our hearts today;

Cleanse us from every sin

And set us free.

Amen!"

The response was immediate. A number of legislators walked out
during the prayer in protest.


In 6 short weeks, Central Christian Church, where Rev. Wright is pastor,
logged more than 5,000 phone calls with only 47 of those calls
responding negatively. 

The church is now receiving international requests
for copies of this prayer from India , Africa and Korea .


Commentator Paul Harvey aired this prayer on his radio Program, "The
Rest of the Story," and received a larger response to this program than
any other he has ever aired.


With the Lord's help, may this prayer sweep over our Nation and
wholeheartedly become our desire so that we again can be called 

"One Nation Under God."


If possible, please pass this prayer on to your friends "if you
don't stand for something, you will fall for anything."


Think about this: If you forward this prayer to everyone on your
e-mail list, in less than 30 days it would be heard by the world.


How many people in your address book will not receive this
prayer.....do you have the guts to pass it on? 

I just did! 

It is OK if some folks get it twice.
