From the Sather's House to Your House

Let us remember again this year
THE REASON FOR THE SEASON
is to praise God for the greatest gift ever given to man-kind
So let us go and tell it on the mountains and everywhere
That Jesus Christ is Lord and that He came as a babe
to save the world from the clutches of Satan.
Let us sing "Joy to the World"
With Christ-like love in our hearts
for all man-kind

Have a joyous and Blessed Christmas
and a Healthy and Happy New Year

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather

We have had a good year here in Mn. the crops were excellent
the rains seem to come at just the right time ~~ 
but should I be surprised God is so good...

Marcie and I have been in good health this year ~~
again I say should I be surprised
God is good...

Next year we are planning a trip on the AM-Track
to the west coast, then down south, then to Michigan,
then to Illinois and home for our 50th Anniversary.

We now have 10 grand-children & 3 great grand-children
all healthy again I say God is good.

I am still working only part-time but I seem
to be busy anyway.

God bless you and yours
Pastor Al & Marcie
