Oh wow! I have been aware of the fact that the ELCA had lost it's way.
There are some who do not condone what is happening in metro-palatine
churches.

I just had a talk with the pastor from the ELCA church here in Greenbush
a couple of weeks ago and I could tell he was disturbed by what was happening.

He was staying with the more conservative way the ELCA used to be. . .

Let me first begin with the subject of denominations ~
It goes without saying there definitely will not be any denominations in heaven.

Each denomination has it's own doctrine as to what they believe -

Now the ELCA and the Catholic church both believe that the pastor/priest have the 
power to change the bread and wine of communion into the body and blood of Christ.

According to the Scriptures, at the Last Supper that Jesus had with His disciples,
He instituted "The Lord's Supper" He took the bread and said, "This is My body"
When He took the cup (wine) He said, "This is My blood."

Matthew 26:26-28

26 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, 
he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take and eat; this is my body.” 
27 Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, 
“Drink from it, all of you. 
28 This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness 
of sins. 

We of the AFLC (Association of Free Lutheran Church) believe that, 'In with and under the 
Word the bread and wine ~ or grape juice ~ become the body and blood of Jesus Christ
through faith. . .

The AFLC came about when a group of Lutherans who were conservative, broke away from 
the LCA because they were becoming more and more liberal. After the break-away the LCA
became the ELCA which over the years has been becoming more and more liberal.

On the subject of homosexuality here is what the scriptures really say:
Leviticus 18:22 
22 “‘Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable

1 Corinthians 6:9 
9 Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? 
Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers 
nor men who have sex with men.

1 Timothy 1:10-11 
10 for the sexually immoral, for those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders and liars 
and perjurers—and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine 
11 that conforms to the gospel concerning the glory of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me. 

If you want, you can read Gen 19:1-29 and see what happened Sodom and Gomorrah because of
their homosexual life style. . .

The question that arises with the thinking that the homosexual style is allowed, is because
the ELCA now says, (The Bible is not the Word of God ~ BUT ONLY contains some words 
that God may have said).

I know a real good pastor of the AFLC in Cokato Mn. that should not be to far from you.

His name is Pastor Lyndon Korhonen ~ his wife's name is Linda.
His home phone is (320) 286-5420
Church office is (619) 972-0081

I have put these numbers down in case you want to check what time service are. . .

I'm sure I haven't covered all your questions ~ but if you want you can send me those 
I have not covered. . .

I know that Pastor Korhonen would be glad to answer your questions too. . .

Your Uncle Al

Pastor Al-

I was interested on your insight on selecting a new church. Up until about a year ago Missy and I had belonged to a local church in Delano (Light of Christ) and we were generally happy with the church. Our hearts were still really with our previous pastor and church (Mt. Olivet & Pastor Kalland) but after moving out of the metro, the drive was just too long. Light of Christ initially was a good church, and Missy was even a Sunday school teacher there for several years. 

However I started seeing things that concerned me related to the direction the church was heading. I started to question the effort put in place to twist the truth of the message to fit the needs of man. Then the ECLA decision to open the ministry to openly practicing homosexual pastors came down. The following weeks at our church brought several new members into the congregation. The church was popular, and the push was full on to endorse sin by twisting scripture to support the sin. The church went as far as to hand out a list of bible verses demonstrating that homosexuality was *supported* by the bible, and they dedicated an entire sermon to the bible and homosexuality. Missy and the kids and I on our last visit to the Church sat behind two women who were a couple, with a child, and the Grandmother. The two women spent the entire sermon stroking each others hair, and backs, and nuzzling each other. Never mind that this kind of behavior during church by a heterosexual couple would be inappropriate to say the least, but here I sit with my kids watching these two woman. Will was practically coming out of seat. At 10 years old, he thought this odd behavior was funny. Madison didn't see the humor, she was actually deeply disturbed. 

So, on our way home from church I had two tasks. First, to explain to the kids what was going on with these two women. And second, to explain how the church and our Pastor had lost their way. I am still in disbelief that a lowly sinner like myself had to stand up, in opposition to the over whelming majority and shout "This is wrong". (figuratively) The church of course called many times when we dropped our membership, and Missy quit teaching, and the kids were taken out of Sunday school. It was interesting the conversations, albeit most of them brief, that followed. The message was generally, "Don't make a rash decision." "It is just one small disagreement" and so on. But the issue to me was much bigger. How can I trust a church to direct/support my families walk with Christ when they clearly have taken it upon themselves to put the wishes of man before Jesus? 

Sorry for all this ranting. I really just wanted to say that Missy and I are still searching for a church home. And it is much harder to find then I ever thought it would be. We have explored other churches, but we have not found the "one" yet. As part of our search we attended a church 2 weeks ago on the recommendation of family friends. The church had a good message (at least for one sermon) and the congregation was quite energetic. Everything seemed pretty normal until the end. I have always attended churches where the service ends with the the Lords Prayer followed by the benediction. But at this church they basically said "Thanks for attending" and everyone walked out. Following the service I learned that they did not do the benediction because they were non-denominational. 

So, here is my ignorance on display. I know what non-denominational means, but what does it really mean in relationship to the faith? For example, I know that one of the differences between Jews and Christians is that the Jews do not believe in Jesus as Christians do. But, what (if any) tenants are specific to the Lutheran religion? How does being a Lutheran differ from being a Catholic? I always thought it was mostly the organization of the church and some specific ceremonies, but is there more? 

And, what does it mean to be non-denominational? I understand that non-denominational means that they are not aligned with any denomination. But, what does this mean when it comes down to simply to the Church and faith? If the message is a Christian message, is it then okay to be non-denominational? It seems to me that you run a bit of a risk with a non-denominational Church since all of the doctrine is directed by potentially one person. It could be easier to drift away from the real message in that environment I suppose. But, given the ECLA and their direction, it is clear that simply belonging to a denomination is not any guarantee of staying on track either.

After all of this I really have only one core question. How important is denomination? I ask this with all sincerity and an open mind/heart. I have always consider myself a Christian first, and then a Lutheran. Is that the right perspective? Having always been a Lutheran, and knowing no difference, I now come to realize that I really don't know what it means to be a Lutheran vs. a Baptist vs. a Catholic. And so on. 

Can you point me towards some texts that would boost my knowledge in this area? 

Thank you Pastor Al.

Mark

01/28/2011~~~food for thought~~~ALWAYS SEEK TO FOLLOW THE LIGHT

Our Bible Verse for Today:
John 8:
Dispute Over Jesus’ Testimony
12 When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, 
“I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will 
never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” 

Our Lesson for Today:
In this day and age it is hard to believe, that occasionally I'm
asked "what does it mean to follow Christ?"

As a soldier follows his captain ~ like that we should follow
Christ, our commander. ~ As a slave follows his master ~ so 
we should follow Christ, or Lord. ~ As we follow the advice of 
a trusted consoler, we should follow Jesus' commands to us 
in Scripture. As we follow the laws of our nation, so we should
follow the laws of the Kingdom of Heaven, and you will never 
walk in darkness. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Lead me, Lord Jesus, to hear the full message of Your Word. . . Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

I am the way, the truth, and the life.
