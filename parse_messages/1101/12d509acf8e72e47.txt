01/04/2011~~~food for thought~~~FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. 
It teaches us to say "No" to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to 
live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age," - Titus 2:11-12 

Our Lesson for Today:
the power to live as a Christian does not come from ourselves, 
it comes from the Holy Spirit. ~ Because Christ died and rescued 
us from sin, we are free from sin's control. . .

God gives us the power and understanding to live according to
His will and to do good. ~ Then we will look forward to Christ's 
wonderful return with eager expectation and hope. . .

It is not enough to renounce sin and evil desires, we must also 
live actively for God. to fight against lust, we must say no to
temptation, but we must also say yes to active service for Christ.

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, I ask that Your Holy Spirit would continue to work
in me the ability to work against temptation and the power to
live in accordance with Your will. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
