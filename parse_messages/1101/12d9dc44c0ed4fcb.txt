Our Bible Verse for Today:
"No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. 
And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. 
But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it." 
- 1 Corinthians 10:13 

Our Lesson for Today:
All humans undergo temptation, even those who, think that they have special
spiritual abilities. . .

God's covenant promise, "He will provide the way of escape." God has 
promised to remain with His people, and so we are never left in a losing 
situation. His grace provides new opportunities for us to be faithful.

While we live in this flesh and have the devil around us, no one can escape
his temptation and lures.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, protect me from being led astray by the many gods of this world.
Protect me by Your Spirit. Thank You for the gift of Your Son, who comes to 
us in His body and blood, and for the gift of the congregation in which I hear 
Your Word proclaimed faithfully and where I receive this life giving sacrament.
Strengthen me that I may build up my fellow members in worship of You. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
