Time For God
















Read only if you have 
time for God 
Let me tell you, make sure you read 
all the way to the bottom. 
I almost deleted this email but I was blessed when I got to the end 












God, 
when I received this 
e-mail, I thought... 



I don't have time for this... 
And, this is really 
inappropriate during work. 















Then, I realized that this kind 
of thinking is.... Exactly, what 
has caused a lot of the problems 
in our world today. 















We try to keep God in 
church on Sunday morning.... 















Maybe, 
Sunday night... 















And, the unlikely event 
o f a midweek 
service. 







We do like to have Him 
around during sickness.... 















And, of course, 
at funerals. 















However, we don't have 
time, or room, for Him 
during work or play... 















Because.. That's the part of 
our lives we think... We can, 
and should, handle 
on our own. 







May God forgive me 
for ever thinking... 















That... There is a time 
or place where.. 







HE is not to be 
FIRST 
in my life. 















We should always 
have time to remember 
all HE has 
done for us. 















If, You aren't 
ashamed to 
do this... 















Please follow the 
directions. 







Jesus said, 'If you are 
ashamed of me, I will be 
ashamed of you 
before my Father.' 







Not 
ashamed? 







Pass this on ONLY 
IF YOU 
MEAN IT!! 












Yes, ..... 

I DO 
Love God. 







HE is my source of 
existence 
and Savior. 







He keeps me functioning 
each and every day. 
Without Him, I will be 
nothing. 
But, with Christ, 
HE strengthens me. 
(Phil 4:13) 





This is the 
simplest test. 







If You Love God... 
And, are not ashamed of 
all the marvelous things 
HE has done for you... 







Send this to ten people 
and the person who 
sent it to you! 




Now do you have the 
time to pass it on? 







Make sure that you 
scroll 
through to the end. 







Easy vs. Hard 







Why is it so hard to tell 
the truth but Yet so 
easy to tell a lie? 







Why are we so sleepy 
in church but Right when 
the sermon is over we 
suddenly wake up? 







Why is it so easy to 
delete a Godly e-mail, 
but yet we forward 
all of the nasty ones? 







Of all the free gifts 
we may receive, 
Prayer 
is the very best one..... 







There are no costs, 
but wonderful rewards... 

GOD BLESS! 







Notes: Isn't it funny how 
simple it is for people 
to trash God and then 
wonder why the 
world's going to hell. 







Isn't it funny how 
someone can say 
'I believe in God' 
but still follow Satan 
(who, by the way, 
also 'believes' 
in God). 







Isn't it funny how you 
can send a thousand 
jokes through e-mail 
and they spread like 
wildfire, but when 
you start sending 
messages regarding 
the Lord, 
people think twice 
about sharing? 







Isn't it funny how 
when you go to forward 
this message, you 
will not send it to many 
on your address list 
because you're not 
sure what they believe, 
or what they will think 
of you for sending 
it to them 







Isn't it funny how I can 
be more worried 
about what other 
people think of me 
than what God 
thinks of me. 







I pray, for everyone 
who sends this to 
their entire address 
book, they will be blessed 
by God 
in a way special for them. 












And send it back to the 
person who sent it, 

to let them know that 
indeed it was sent 
out to many more.
