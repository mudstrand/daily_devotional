02/01/2011~~~food for thought~~~THE WAY TO LOVE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"You, Lord, are forgiving and good, abounding in 
love to all who call to you." - Psalm 86:5 

Our Lesson for Today:
It goes without saying that the "Lord is forgiving and good".
How does this come about? Well David says it is because
"The Lord is abounding in love."

The Greek word here is "agape," In other words self-giving,
sacrificial concern for someone. The word was adopted by Christians;
it characterizes God and is the basis of His actions toward us in Christ.

Now there is a condition we should never forget. Those loved by God
are to show love toward one another. . .

Take the time to read Paul's letter to the Corinthians ~ 1 Cor. 13 this 
whole chapter is dedicated to "The way to love." ~ WHY? Because 
we are loved by God/Christ, and we are to show Christ/like love for
one another. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear all knowing Lord, when others disappoint and annoy me, 
take my hands and stretch them wide to embrace them with 
Your all-embracing love; through Jesus, our Savior. . . Amen. 

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
