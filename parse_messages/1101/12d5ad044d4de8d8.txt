01/06/2011~~~food for thought~~~ALWAYS READ CAREFULLY 

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"Wash and make yourselves clean. ~ Take your evil deeds out of my sight; ~ stop doing wrong. 
Learn to do right; ~ seek justice. ~ Defend the oppressed. ~ Take up the cause of the fatherless; 
plead the case of the widow." - Isaiah 1:16-17

Our Lesson for Today:
The reason I separated each of these phrases is to show how easy it is to
take Scripture out of context and think that we must have a hand in our salvation 
if we do not read verses before and after.

God must do this according to His means, we cannot deliver ourselves.
Is righteousness given because of these works? Absolutely not!
The prophet himself says in (45:24) "In the Lord is my righteousness"

The careless treatment of the helpless reveals the lack of faith. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, open my eyes that I may see the truth You
want me to learn. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
