Bible Verse for Today:
"Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, "Anyone who wants 
to be first must be the very last, and the servant of all."" - Mark 9:35 

Our Lesson for Today:
What Jesus is attempting to do is, teach us that true status is found in serving
those who God values. ~ When we are tempted to debate who is the greatest,
we should instead look to where the Master hangs on the cross. . .

He represents us before the Father in order to redeem us, and He leads us by 
the cross into a new life. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, forgive us for our battles over greatness. Remind us that
You alone are great, for You have served the least among us. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
