I wish you all a Miracle 























I'D LIKE THIS BACK IF IT APPLIES 

A little girl went 
to her bedroom and pulled a glass jelly jar from its hiding place in the closet. 


She poured the change out on the floor and counted it carefully. Three 
times, even.. The total had to be exactly perfect.. No chance here for mistakes. 


Carefully placing the coins back in the jar and twisting on the cap, she 
slipped out the back door and made her way 6 blocks to Rexall's Drug Store with 
the big red Indian Chief sign above the door. 

She waited patiently for 
the pharmacist to give her some attention, but he was too busy at this moment. 
Tess twisted her feet to make a scuffing noise. Nothing. She cleared her throat 
with the most disgusting sound she could muster. No good. Finally she took a 
quarter from her jar and banged it on the glass counter. That did it! 


'And what do you want?' the pharmacist asked in an annoyed tone of 
voice.. I'm talking to my brother from Chicago whom I haven't seen in ages,' he 
said without waiting for a reply to his question. 

'Well, I want to talk 
to you about my brother,' Tess answered back in the same annoyed tone. 'He's 
really, really sick....and I want to buy a miracle.' 

'I beg your pardon?' 
said the pharmacist. 

'His name is Andrew and he has something bad 
growing inside his head and my Daddy says only a miracle can save him now. So how 
much does a miracle cost?' 

'We don't sell miracles here, little girl. 
I'm sorry but I can't help you,' the pharmacist said, softening a little. 


'Listen, I have the money to pay for it. If it isn't enough, I will get 
the rest. Just tell me how much it costs.' 

The pharmacist's brother was 
a well dressed man. He stooped down and asked the little girl, 'What kind of a 
miracle does your brother need?' 

' I don't know,' Tess replied with her 
eyes welling up. I just know he's really sick and Mommy says he needs an 
operation. But my Daddy can't pay for it, so I want to use my money..' 


'How much do you have?' asked the man from Chicago . 

'One dollar 
and eleven cents,' Tess answered barely audible. 

'And it's all the money 
I have, but I can get some more if I need to.' 

'Well, what a 
coincidence,' smiled the man. 'A dollar and eleven cents---the exact price of a 
miracle for little brothers.' 

He took her money in one hand and with 
the other hand he grasped her mitten and said 'Take me to where you live. I want 
to see your brother and meet your parents. Let's see if I have the miracle you need.' 

That well-dressed man was Dr. Carlton Armstrong, a surgeon, 
specializing in neuro-surgery. The operation was completed free of charge and it 
wasn't long until Andrew was home again and doing well. 

Mom and Dad were 
happily talking about the chain of events that had led them to this place. 


'That surgery,' her Mom whispered. 'was a real miracle. I wonder how 
much it would have cost?' 

Tess smiled. She knew exactly how much a 
miracle cost....one dollar and eleven cents...plus the faith of a little child. 


In our lives, we never know how many miracles we will need. 

A 
miracle is not the suspension of natural law, but the operation of a higher law. 
I know you'll keep the ball moving! 

Here it goes. Throw it back to 
someone who means something to you! 

A ball is a circle, no beginning, no 
end. It keeps us together like our Circle of Friends. But the treasure inside 
for you to see is the treasure of friendship you've granted to me. 

Today 
I pass the friendship ball to you. 

Pass it on to someone who is a friend 
to you. 

MY OATH TO YOU... 

When you are sad.....I will dry your 
tears. 

When you are scared.....I will comfort your fears. 

When 
you are worried......I will give you hope. 

When you are confused.....I 
will help you cope. 

And when you are lost...and can't see the light, I 
shall be your beacon...shining ever so bright.. 

This is my oath.....I 
pledge till the end. 

Why you may ask?....Because you're my friend. 


Signed: GOD 

INSTANTLY WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS LETTER, YOU ARE 
REQUESTED TO SEND IT TO AT LEAST 10 PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE PERSON WHO SENT IT TO 
YOU.
