01/25/2011~~~food for thought~~~RESTORE ONE-ANOTHER TO FAITH

Bible Verse for Today:
"[Doing Good to All] Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in 
a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. 
But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted." - Galatians 6:1 

Our Lesson for Today:
All Christians have the Holy Spirit, not just a select few. 
they follow the Spirit's leading by gently and humbly caring
for one who lapses into sin. . .

Even though we have sins, the grace of the Holy Spirit does
not allow them to harm us. In the Christian church there is
(continuous, uninterrupted) forgiveness of sin. . .

Never, ever, underestimate the working of the Holy Spirit. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I pray that Your Holy Spirit would give me
daily victories over sin in my personal life, and, above
all, the power to love my brothers and sisters in Christ. . .Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
