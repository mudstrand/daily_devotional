01/24/2011~~~food for thought~~~ASK IN FAITH

Our Bible Verse for Today: James 1:5-8 
5 If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, 
who gives generously to all without finding fault, 
and it will be given to you. 
6 But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, 
because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, 
blown and tossed by the wind. 
7 That person should not expect to receive anything 
from the Lord. 
8 Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do. 

Our Lesson for Today:
When James says ~ "any of you" We know by vs. 2 he is referring 
to struggling Christians. He is actually calling them back to faith.
remember that God gives generously to all who ask in faith, whatever
their past. . .

Without trust in God's faithfulness, a person has no solid foundation.
Only in faith which trusts is God's provision, does one receive His
blessings. . .

"Double-minded" here means two allegiances: God and the world.
Such a person can not persevere.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, deliver me from my struggles and grant
me the gifts that come from You alone. Lead me in
Your wisdom until I am raised to receive the crown of life. . .Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 1
