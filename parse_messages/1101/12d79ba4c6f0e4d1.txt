01/12/2011~~~food for thought~~~LIMITLESS LOVE & FAITHFULNESS

Our Bible Verse for Today:
1 Praise the LORD, all you nations; extol him, all you peoples. 
2 For great is his love toward us, and the faithfulness of the LORD
endures forever. Praise the LORD. Psalm 117

Our Lesson for Today:
Have you ever said, "I can't think of anything God has done for me.
How can I praise Him?"

This Psalm gives two reasons for praising God: His unfailing love toward 
us and His faithfulness that endures forever. . .

If He did nothing else for us, He would still be worthy of our highest praise.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord I thank you for Your unfailing love and
faithfulness. . .Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
