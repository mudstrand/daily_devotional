01/11/2011~~~~food for thought~~~LIVING FOR JESUS

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do; 
for it is written: "Be holy, because I am holy."" - 1 Peter 1:15-16 

Our Lesson for Today:
After people commit their lives to Christ, they sometimes still feel
a pull back to their old ways. ~ Peter tells us to be like our heavenly
Father ~ holy in everything we do. . .

"Holiness" means being totally devoted or dedicated to God, set
aside for His special use set apart from sin and its influence. . .

We are to be set apart and different, not blending in with the crowd,
yet not being different just for the sake of being different. God's 
qualities in our life make us different. . .

Don't use the excuse that you can't help slipping into sin. Rely on
God's power to free you from sin's grip. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, give me the power to remain totally
committed to you. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
