01/05/2011~~~food for Thought~~~ACTING IN WAYS WHICH PLEASE GOD

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the LORD 
require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with 
your God." - Micah 6:8 

Our Lesson for Today:
It would be interesting to know just how many ways people have tried to 
please God. BUT God has made His wishes clear. He want His people
to do what is right, love mercy, and walk humbly with Him. . .

In your efforts to please God, examine these areas on a regular basis:
Are you fair in your dealings with people?
Do you show mercy to those who have wronged you?
Are you learning humility?

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to remember to regularly examine
my dealings with others, show mercy even to those who
have wronged me, and help me to learn genuine humility. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
