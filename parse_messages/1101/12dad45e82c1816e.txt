01/22/2011~~~food for thought~~~WHAT YOU SOW YOU WILL REAP

Bible Verses for Today:
"Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. 
Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; 
whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life." - Galatians 6:7-8

Our Lesson for Today:
A few days ago someone questioned a remark I made about the work of the Holy Spirit.
I think this will answer your question. . .

What verse 6 is saying is that humans can not turn up their noses at God and 
expect to get by with it. That is what is meant by "God cannot be mocked."

The immutable law built into creation, illustrated by sowing and reaping, is really
saying that, our actions have consequences. . .

Those who "Sow to the Holy Spirit," are living under the Holy Spirit's power and 
direction and, "will reap eternal life."

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, again I pray that I will be sensitive to the
Holy Spirit's leading so that I may reap eternal life. . .Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
