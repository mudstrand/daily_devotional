Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, 
whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is 
admirable-if anything is excellent or praiseworthy-think about 
such things." - Philippians 4:8 

Our Lesson for Today:
Paul commands that we continually keep these virtues.
WHY? ~~~ Because they are the fundamental ideals of life 
according to God's design. . .

The forefront of our minds, in our very consciousness, is where
our inspiration and guide come from in all we do. 

That is why it is important that we meditate on the Word because 
it will awaken new understanding, pleasure, and devoutness and 
produce a pure heart and pure thoughts. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Blessed be the Lord, who has not left us to our own folly, 
but has called and enlightened us to live according to His
mercy in Christ. . .Amen

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
