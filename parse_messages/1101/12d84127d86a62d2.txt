01/14/2011~~~food for thought~~~NO LONGER GOD'S ENEMIES

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not 
counting people's sins against them. And he has committed 
to us the message of reconciliation. We are therefore Christ's 
ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. 
We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God." - 2 Corinthians 5:19-20 

Our Lesson for Today:
God (reconciles) or brings us back to Himself, by blotting out our sins
and making us right with Him. ~ When we trust in Christ, we are no longer 
God's enemies or strangers or foreigners to Him. Because we have 
been reconciled to God, we have the privilege of encouraging others 
to do the same. . .

As an (ambassador), believers have the task of reconciling people to Him.
We have been (called or sent) with His message of reconciliation to the world.

How well are you fulfilling your commission as Christ's ambassador?

Prayer Suggestion:
Thank You, Jesus, for taking my sins and making me right with God. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
