01/20/2011~~~food for thought~~~THINGS TO DO TODAY ~ BE EXTRA NICE TO SOMEONE.

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"So in everything, do to others what you would have them 
do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets." - Matthew 7:12 

Our Lesson for Today:
I believe we all recognize this verse as the Golden Rule, but did you know
that in many religions this is stated negatively: (it is written this way) ~ 
"Don't do to others what you don't want done to you."

By stating it positively, Jesus made it more significant. It is not very hard to 
refrain from harming others; but is much more difficult to take the initiative
in doing something good for them.

The Golden Rule, as Jesus formulated it, is the foundation of active goodness
and mercy ~ the kind of love God shows to us each day. Think of a good and 
merciful action you can do today:

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, guide me by your Holy Spirit that I may be
merciful to others. Help me put others ahead of myself. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
