Bible Verses for Today:
"So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of 
you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. 
There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male 
and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." - Galatians 3:26-28 

Lesson for Today:
I believe it is our natural inclination to feel uncomfortable around people
who are different from us, and then ~ to gravitate toward those who are
similar to us. . .

But when we allow our differences to separate us from our fellow believers
we are disregarding clear biblical teaching. We should make a point of seeking
out and appreciating people who are not just like us and our friends. . .

We just may find out that we have a lot in common with them. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to not make distinctions that
Christ has removed. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
