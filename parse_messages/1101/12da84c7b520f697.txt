01/21/2011~~~food for thought~~~LEARNING FROM OUR TRIALS

Our Bible Verses for Today:

"[Trials and Temptations] Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, 
whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing 
of your faith produces perseverance." - James 1:2-3 

Our Lesson for Today:
Did you notice that James did not say if trouble comes your way but whenever
it does. Like James I think we agree from experience that trouble is inevitable.
So what do we do when they do come?

I believe what James is saying in vs. 3 is that we can profit from them, because
they can produce perseverance and who does not need perseverance? Now the
point is not to pretend to be happy when we face pain, but have a positive outlook.

Let us use troubles as a learning experience ~ because tough times can teach us
perseverance. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, Help me grow my patience though the troubles that
are bound to come in this life. Give me a positive attitude. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
