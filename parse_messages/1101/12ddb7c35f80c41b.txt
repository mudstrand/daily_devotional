Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, 
bearing with one another in love." - Ephesians 4:2 

Our Lesson for Today:
Paul wrote this to the first church for the sake of unity ~ and oh, how many 
churches need to hear Paul's advice today when deciding on major as well
as minor projects.

So often when reading Scriptures we skim over these little verses, but
lets take a closer look. . .

"Be completely humble" ~ ~ ~ "be gentle" ~ ~ ~ "be patient"
"bearing with one another in love"

How often have we seen the words (humble ~ gentle ~ patient ~ and love),
thrown to the wind when people with different agendas come together?

When making any decisions in the church ~ STOP ~ and remember ~
these things ~ then pray:

Dear Lord, bind us together with a humble, gentle, patient loving attitude. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
