Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Do everything without grumbling or arguing, so that you may become blameless 
and pure, "children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation." 
Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky as you hold firmly to the word 
of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or 
labor in vain." - Philippians 2:14-16 

Our Lesson for Today:
"grumbling or arguing," First we have the normal behavior of the sinful human nature
which is selfish and unbelieving. . .

"children of God," Here we should understand that God provides regeneration so that
by His Word and Spirit we are a new creation according to the inner person.

"without fault (blemish)," Everything that is wrong with us has been forgiven by the Lord 
Jesus. According to our new nature, there is nothing wrong. . .

"crooked and twisted generation," God created us to live in perfect harmony with Him,
His creation, and with one another at every point of contact, in every way. . .

"shine like stars, (lights)" This was an important theme for Paul and John. Light may be
directed or reflected. We reflect God's light (His truth and grace) by receiving it and
directing that light to shine on others. . .

"the Word of life," God gives life through the Word, as creation and the Gospel show.

"the Day of Christ," This refers to a time (no not some 24 hours) in which God
dramatically reveals and / or executes His judgment by condemning the wicked and
delivering the righteousness. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, fill my life with the fruit of Your righteousness
so that I might abound in love, approve what is excellent, and be
pure and blameless on the day of Your return. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
