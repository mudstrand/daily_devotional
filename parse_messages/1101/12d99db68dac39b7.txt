Good answer.

Congressional Reform Act of 2011

The 26th amendment (granting the right to vote for 18 year-olds) took
only 3 months & 8 days to be ratified! Why? Simple! The people
demanded it. That was in 1971...before computers, before e-mail,
before cell phones, etc.



Of the 27 amendments to the Constitution, seven (7) took 1 year or
less to become the law of the land...all because of public pressure.



I'm asking each addressee to forward this email to a minimum of twenty
people on their address list; in turn ask each of those to do
likewise.



In three days, most people in The United States of America will have
the message. This is one idea that really should be passed around.



Congressional Reform Act of 2011



1. Term Limits.



12 years only, one of the possible options below..



A. Two Six-year Senate terms

B. Six Two-year House terms

C. One Six-year Senate term and three Two-Year House terms



2. No Tenure / No Pension.



A Congressman collects a salary while in office and receives no pay
when they are out of office.



3. Congress (past, present & future) participates in Social Security.



All funds in the Congressional retirement fund move to the Social
Security system immediately. All future funds flow into the Social
Security system, and Congress participates with the American people.



4. Congress can purchase their own retirement plan, just as all Americans do.



5. Congress will no longer vote themselves a pay raise. Congressional
pay will rise by the lower of CPI or 3%.



6. Congress loses their current health care system and participates in
the same health care system as the American people.



7. Congress must equally abide by all laws they impose on the American people.



8. All contracts with past and present Congressmen are void effective 1/1/11.



The American people did not make this contract with Congressmen.
Congressmen made all these contracts for themselves.





Serving in Congress is an honor, not a career. The Founding Fathers
envisioned citizen legislators, so ours should serve their term(s),
then go home and back to work.





If each person contacts a minimum of twenty people then it will only
take three days for most people (in the U.S. ) to receive the message.
Maybe it is time.



THIS IS HOW YOU FIX CONGRESS!!!!! If you agree with the above, pass it
on. If not, just delete



You are one of my 20+. Please keep it going.

Be Blessed and Grateful!
