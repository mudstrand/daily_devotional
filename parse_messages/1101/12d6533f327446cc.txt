01/08/2011~~~food for thought~~~FOLLOWING GOD'S EXAMPLE

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"Follow God's example, therefore, as dearly loved children and walk
in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us 
as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God." - Ephesians 5:1-2 

Our Lesson for Today:
Have you ever thought of yourself as a child? ~ We are God's children
and just a children imitate their parents, we should follow God's example.

His great love for us led Him to sacrifice Himself so that we might live.
Our love for others should be of the same kind ~ A love that goes beyond
affection to self sacrificing service. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I pray for a love that would become
a love of self-sacrificing service. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
