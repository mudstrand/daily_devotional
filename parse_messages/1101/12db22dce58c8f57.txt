Bible Verses for Today:
"[Ask, Seek, Knock] "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and 
you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone 
who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, 
the door will be opened." - Matthew 7:7-8 

Our Lesson for Today:
Here we see that Jesus emphasizes the blessings and importance of prayer.
Most important is our heavenly Father's eagerness to give His children "good
things."

Because of our sinful nature, we do not always recognize that God answers
every prayer for good. Jesus guarantees that we receive God's mercy and
blessings. . .

Suggested prayer:
Dear Father in heaven, You give only good things to me.
Increase my trust and confidence in Your goodness. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
