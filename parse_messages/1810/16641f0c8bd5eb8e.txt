VERSE FOR TODAY

_That which is, has already been, that which __IS __to be, already
has been;_

_and God seeks what has been driven away. _(Ec. 3:15)

_THOUGHT FOR TODAY:_

The complaining we often hear is: There is nothing new under the sun!

Lets not be negative today and focus on what God's Word says FOR
TODAY:

_"God seeks for what has been driven way. _The one searching for
meaning

in life, should read this verse again. To avoid a meaningless life
one needs

to seek a closer relationship with God, justification based on God's
favor

toward us is on account of Christ and received through faith in Him.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Heavenly Father, prepare me for Your judgment through Your Word

and the marvelous news that You have already judged me as worthy of

eternal life through the death and resurrection of Your Son, our
Savior.

Amen.
