GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~Christ is the only way

Our Meditation for Today:

For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God
is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord...(Ro. 6:23) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Yes we are free to choose between two masters, sin or Christ Jesus.
BUT the wages of sin is eternal death...

That is all you can expect or hope for in a life without God...

By choosing Christ as your master, you receive His gift of eternal
life~~new life with God that begins on earth and continues forever
with God...

What choice have you made???

We need to remember, eternal life is a gift from God. AND if it is a gift, 
then it is not something that we can earn, nor something that must be 
paid for...

Consider the foolishness of someone who receives a gift given out of
love and then offers to pay for it...

A gift cannot be purchased by the recipient. A more appropriate response
to a loved one who offers a gift is graceful acceptance with gratitude...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I cannot thank You enough for the 
wonderful gift of salvation, made possible by Your Son 
Jesus Christ. I pray that You would give me a more 
faithful heart. My request today is that You would 
keep our nation, its citizens and our troops safe...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will sustain you...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
