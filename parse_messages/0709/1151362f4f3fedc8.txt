Subject: Mexican Interview 




Here is a REAL INTERVIEW with an illegal Mexican at a 
protest march in Texas.


This is good! Below is a good example of a discussion 
with a master of circular logic. Don't be logical, 
don't respect the truth or your adversary, just say 
what you think makes a new case when the previous case 
gets too difficult to defend. On the streets of 
downtown Houston , May 1, 2006. 

Jim Moore reporting for a Houston TV station: 
Jim: Juan, I see that you and thousands of other 
protesters are marching in the streets to demonstrate 
for your cause. Exactly what is your cause and 
what do you expect to accomplish by this protest? 
Juan: We want our rights. We will show you how 
powerful we are. We will bring Houston to its knees! 

Jim: What rights? 
Juan: Our right to live here...legally. Our right t o 
get all the benefits you get. 

Jim: When did you come to the United States ? 
Juan: Six years ago. I crossed over the border at 
night with seven other friends. 

Jim: Why did you come? 
Juan: For work. I can earn as much in a month as I 
could in a year in Mexico. Besides, I get free health 
care, our Mexican children can go to school free, if I 
lose my job I will get Welfare, and someday I will 
have 
the Social Security. Nothing like that in Mexico! 

Jim: Did you feel badly about breaking our immigration 
laws when you came? 
Juan: No! Why should I feel bad? I have a right to be 
here. I have a right to amnesty. I paid lots of money 
for my Social Security and Green Cards. 

Jim: How did you acquire those documents? 
Juan: From a guy in Dallas . He charged me a lot of 
money too. 

Jim: Did you know that those documents were forged? 
Juan: It is of no matter. I have a right to be here 
and wor k. 

Jim: What is the 'right' you speak of? 
Juan: The right of all Aliens. It is found in your 
Constitution. Read it! 

Jim: I have read it, but I do not remember it saying 
anything about rights for Aliens. 
Juan: It is in that part where it says that all men 
have Alien rights, like the right to pursue happiness. 
I wasn't happy in Mexico, so I came here. 

Jim: I think you are referring to the Declaration of 
Independence and that document speaks to unalienable 
rights .. Not Alien rights. 
Juan: Whatever. 

Jim: Since you are demanding to become an American 
citizen, why then are you carrying a Mexican Flag? 
Juan: Because I am Mexican. 

Jim: But you said you want to be given amnesty ... to 

become a US citizen. 
Juan: No. This is not what we want. This is our 
country, a part of Mexico that you Gringos stole from 
us. We want it returned to it's rightful owner. 

Jim: Juan, you are standing in Texas . After wining 
the war with Mexico, Texas became a Republic, and 
later Texans voted to join the USA. It was not stolen 
from Mexico. 
Juan: That is a Gringo lie. Texas was stolen. So was 
California, New Mexico and Arizona . It is just like 
all the other stuff you Gringos steal, like oil and 
babies. You are a country of thieves. 

Jim: Babies? You think we steal babies? 
Juan: Sure. Like from Korea and Vietnam and China . I 
see them all over the place. You let all these 
foreigners in, but try to keep us Mexicans out. How 
is this fair? 

Jim: So, you really don't want to become an American 
citizen then. 
Juan: I just want my rights! Everyone has a right to 
live, work, and speak their native language wherever 
and whenever they please. That's another thing we 
demand. All signs and official documents should be in 
Spanish. Teachers must teach in Spanish. Soon, more 
people here in Houston will speak Span ish than 
English. It is our right! 

Jim: If I were to cross over the border into Mexico 
without proper documentation, what rights would I have 
there? 
Juan: None. You would probably go to jail, but that's 
different. 

Jim: How is it different? You said everyone has the 
right to live wherever they please. 
Juan: You Gringos are a bunch of land grabbing 
thieves. Now you want Mexico too? Mexico has its 
rights. You Gringos have no rights in Mexico. Why 
would you want to go there anyway? There is no free 
medical service, schools, or welfare there for 
foreigners such as you. You cannot even own land in my 
country. Stay in the country of your birth. 

Jim: I can see that there is no way that we can agree 
on this issue. Thank you for your comments. 
Juan: Viva Mexico! 

Pass this along to every American citizen in your 
address books and to every representative in the state 
and federal government. If y ou choose to remain 
uninvolved, do not be amazed when you no longer have a 
nation to call your own nor anything you have worked 
for left since it will be 'redistributed' to the 
activists while you are so peacefully staying out of 
the 'fray'. 


Check history, it is full of nations/empires that 
disappeared when it's citizens no longer held their 
core beliefs and values. One person CAN make a 
difference. One plus one plus one plus one plus one 
plus one........ 

The battle for our secure borders and immigration laws 
that actually mean something, however, hasn't even 
begun. 

If this ticks YOU off...PASS IT ON!
