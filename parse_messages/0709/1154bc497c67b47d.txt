Subject: VALUABLE LESSON


Back in September of 2005, on the first day of school, Martha
Cothren, a social studies school teacher at Robinson High School in Little 
Rock,
did something not to be forgotten. On the first day of school, with the
permission of the school superintendent, the principal and the building
supervisor, she removed all of the desks out of her classroom. Whenthe
first period kids entered the room they discovered that there were no desks.

Looking around, confused, they asked, "Ms. Cothren, where're our desks?"
She replied, "You can't have a desk until you tell me what you have done
to earn the right to sit at a desk."

They thought, "Well, maybe it's our grades." "No," she said. "Maybe
it's our behavior?

She told them, "No, it's not even your behavior".

And so, they came and went, the first period, second period, third
period.

Still no desks in the classroom. By early afternoon television news crews
had started gathering in Ms. Cothren's classroom to report about this
crazy teacher who had taken all the desks out of her room.

The final period of the day came and as the puzzled students found seats
on the floor of the deskless classroom, Martha Cothren said, "Throughout
the day no one has been able to tell me just what he/she has done to earn
the right to sit at the desks that are ordinarily found in this classroom..

Now I am going to tell you." At this point, Martha Cothren went over to
the door of her classroom and opened it. Twenty-seven U.S.Veterans,
all in uniforms, walked into that classroom, each one carrying a school 
desk.
The Vets began placing the school desks in rows, and then they would walk
over and stand alongside the wall.

By the time the last soldier had set the final desk in place those kids
started to understand, perhaps for the first time in their lives, just how
the right to sit at those desks had been earned. Martha said, "You didn't
earn the right to sit at these desks. These heroes did it for you.
They placed the desks here for you. Now, it's up to you to sit in them. It
is your responsibility to learn, to be good students, to be good citizens.
They paid the price so that you could have the freedom to get an
education. Don't ever forget it."

This is a true story....
If you can read this, Thank a teacher.
If you read it in English,.Thank a soldier.
