GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~The result of sinful deeds is an eternal death...

Our Meditation for Today:

But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been
released from the law so that we serve in a new way of
the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code...(Ro. 7:6) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Some people think they have earned their way to heaven be living
a good and respectful life...

But often all they have earned for their efforts is frustration and
discouragement...

However because of Christ's sacrifice, the way to God is already open,
and we can become His children simply by putting our faith in Him.

We no longer need to try to reach God by keeping rules, we can become 
more and more like Jesus as we live for Him day by day...

We need to allow the Holy Spirit to turn our eyes away from our own 
performance and toward Jesus. He will free us to serve Him out of 
love and gratitude...

This is known as living "In the new way, by the Spirit".

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I know that I can not earn my own way 
to Your heavenly kingdom, but I still often need help, to turn 
my eyes away from my own performance and to turn them to 
Jesus Christ...Keep our nation, its citizens and our troops safe...Amen.

Keep looking up, in an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
