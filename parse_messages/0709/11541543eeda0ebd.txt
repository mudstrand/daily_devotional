GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~The Lord is our shield and protects the way of His faithful ones.

Our Meditation for Today:

Therefore, brothers we have an obligation, but it is 
not to the sinful nature, to live according to it...

For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die; 
but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, 
you will live...(Ro. 8:12-13) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

When we turn away from sin's appeal by the Holy Spirit's power,
regarding sin as dead, we can ignore/overcome temptation when 
it comes...

Lets review what Paul wrote in (Ro. 6:10, 11).

He, Jesus, died once to defeat sin, and now He lives for the glory
of God. So you should consider yourselves dead to sin and able
to live for the glory of God through Christ Jesus...

What Paul is saying is that we should regard our old sinful nature
as dead and unresponsive to sin~~that is if we identify ourselves 
with Christ...

If and when we started a new life in Christ, the Holy Spirit is there
to help us become all Christ wants us to be...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I do confess that my greatest wish
is to become more like Christ, however, the old nature keeps
creeping back. Forgive me for stumbling, and falling short
of all You want me to be...Amen.

Keep looking up, He wants to guide you in paths of righteousness...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
