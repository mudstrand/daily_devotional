GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~There is no big or little sin, any size sin is spelled s-i-n.

Our Meditation for Today:

For sin seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment,
deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death.

So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous 
and good...(Ro. 7:11, 12) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Sin can deceive people by misleading them by the law...
the law was holy, expressing God's nature and will for the
people...


In the Garden of Eden (Gen. 3), the serpent deceived Eve,
changing her focus from the freedom she had to one
restriction God had made...

Ever since then we have all been rebels. Sin looks good to us
precisely because God has said it is wrong...

Instead of paying attention to His warnings, we use them as the 
"to do" list. When we are tempted to rebel, we need to look at 
the law from a wider perceptive~~in the light of God's grace
and mercy...

If we focus on His great love for us, we will understand that
He only restricts from actions and attitudes that harm us...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that You will forgive me because
I have, and I am sure I will again, stray from the truth. Lord,
instill in me a heart of obedience and love...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is sufficient in all things...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
