GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~When you can't sleep at night , don't count sheep~~~talk to the shepherd.

Our Meditation for Today:

Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone 
to obey him as slaves, you are slaves to the one whom you
obey~~whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or
to obedience, which leads to righteousness?

But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin,
you whole heatedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you 
were entrusted.

You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to 
righteousness...(Ro. 6:16-18) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

All people have one master or another and they pattern themselves
after him...

Without Jesus, we would have no choice, we would be enslaved to sin, 
and the result would be guilt, suffering, and separation from God...

Thanks to Jesus, however, we can now choose God as our Master.
Following Him, we can enjoy new life and learn how to work for Him...

Are you still serving your first master sin?
Or have you chosen God?

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I can not thank You enough for the 
wonderful gift of salvation that is ours in Christ Jesus. I pray
that You will guide me in paths of righteousness...Amen.

Keep looking up, in Him all things are possible...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
