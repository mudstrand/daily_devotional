GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Be careful sin has a heavy handed grasp

Our Meditation for Today:

Once I was alive apart from the law; but when the commandment
came, sin sprang to life and I died...

I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life 
actually brought death...(Ro. 7:9, 10) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

When we say, "Where there is no law, there is no sin," what we mean is,
people cannot know their actions are sinful unless they have a law that
forbids those actions...

God's law makes people realize that they are sinners doomed to die,
yet it offers no help...

Sin is real, and it is dangerous...

Imagine a sunny day at the beach. You plunge into the surf, then you
notice a sign on the pier: "No swimming, sharks..." Your day is ruined.

Is it the signs fault? Are you angry with the people who put it up?

The law is like the sign. It is essential, and we are grateful for it~~but
it does not get rid of the sharks...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for pointing out 
my sins through the law. Help me to become more 
sensitive to my unfaithfulness...Guide and direct me
I pray...Amen.


Keep looking up, in recognition of His greatness...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
