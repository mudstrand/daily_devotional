Subject: [FWD: Child Ears]





When my twin daughters were young, I taught them to say this prayer before
going to bed. As I listened outside their door, I could hear them say,
"Give us this steak and daily bread, and forgive us our mattresses." My
husband and I always had a good laugh over this. That was over 50 years
ago, and the memory still remains in my heart.


Groton , Mass. My mother spent her early childhood saying, "Hail
Mary, full of grapes."



Missoula , Mont. My son, who is in nursery school, said, "Our
Father, who art in Heaven, how didja know my name?"



Uniontown , Ohio I remember thinking this prayer was "Give us
this day our jelly bread."



Covina , Calif. I recall reading something years ago about the
Pledge of Allegiance. Some child thought it began, "I led the pigeons to
the flag.."



Cleveland , Ohio When I was little, I often wondered who Richard
Stands was. You know: "I pledge allegiance to the flag . . And to the
republic for Richard Stands."



Tampa , Fla. When my husband was 6 years old, he thought a
certain Prayer was "He suffered under a bunch of violets." The real words
were "under Pontius Pilate," but at that age, he didn't know better. To
this day, we still snicker in church whenever that prayer is read.



Oak Harbor , Wash. When my older brother was very young, he
always walked up to the church altar with my mother when she took
communion. On one occasion, he tugged at her arm and asked, "What does the
priest say when he gives you the bread?" Mom whispered something in his
ear. Imagine his shock many years later when he learned that the priest
doesn't say, "Be quiet until you get to your seat."



Grand Junction , Colo. When I was younger, I believed the line
was "Lead a snot into temptation." I thought I was praying for my little
sister to get into trouble.
