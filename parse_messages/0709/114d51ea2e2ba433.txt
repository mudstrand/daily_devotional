GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Life is what we make it, Always has been~~~Always will be.

Our Meditation for Today:

Sin shall not be your master, because you are not under
the law, but under grace...

What then? shall we sin because we are not under the law 
but under grace? By no means! (Ro. 6:14, 15) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

If we are no longer under the law but under grace, are we now
free to sin and disregard the Ten Commandments?

Paul says, "Of course not!"

When we were under the law, sin was our master--the law does 
not justify us or help us overcome sin...

But now we are bound to Christ, He is our Master, and He gives 
us power to do good rather than evil.

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that You would convict 
me of my sins when I use excuses why it is all right 
to go against Your will. I pray for added power to be 
able to abstain from sin and thus only do what is right.
I pray that You will keep our Nation, its citizens, and
our troops safe...Amen.

Keep looking up, He has the power...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
