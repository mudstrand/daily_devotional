GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~The answer to our sin problem is Jesus Christ...

Our Meditation for Today:

I see another law at work in the members of my body, 
waging war against the law of my mind and making me
a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members.

What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from
this body of death?

Thanks be to God~~through Jesus Christ our Lord! So
then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but 
in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin...(Ro. 7:23-25) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

The "law at work within" is the sin nature deep within us.
This is our vulnerability to sin; it refers to everything within
us that is more loyal to our old way of selfish living than
to God...

This inward struggle with sin was as real to Paul as it is 
to us. We can learn what to do about it from Paul...

Whenever Paul felt lost, he returned to the beginning of 
his spiritual life, remembering that he had already been 
freed by Jesus Christ...

When we feel confused and overwhelmed by sin's appeal,
we need to follow Paul's example:

Thank God that He has given us freedom through Jesus Christ.
We need to let the reality of Christ's power to lift us up to real
victory over sin...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the power to 
overcome sin through Your Son Jesus Christ. Help 
me to remember to turn to Him each day when the
sin problem returns...Amen.

Keep looking up, for the power to overcome sin...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
