GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding...

Our Meditation for Today:

(here is the follow up to yesterdays devotion:

Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit,
groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the 
redemption of our bodies...

For in this hope we were saved. but hope that is seen is no hope at all. 
Who hopes for what he already has???

But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently...
(Ro 8:23-25) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

It should be natural for children to trust their parents, eventhough
parents sometimes fail to keep their promises, Our Heavenly
Father, however, never makes promises He won't keep...

But we need to remember His timing is different from ours, so
His plan may take longer than we expect. So instead of acting like 
impatient children as we wait for God's will to unfold, we need to 
have confidence in God's perfect timing and wisdom...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me when I pray for a special
need and I grow impatient while waiting for an answer. I often
forget that Your timing is much better than mine, as You know
all things. Help me to always wait patiently...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is only a prayer away...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
