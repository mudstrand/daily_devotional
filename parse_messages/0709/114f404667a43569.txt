GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Given the chance the Holy Spirit will
enable us to do good deeds for God...

Our Meditation for Today:

So my brothers, you also died to the law through the body
of Christ, that you might belong to another, to Him who was 
raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God...
(Ro. 7:4) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

When a person dies to the old life and accepts Christ as Savior,
a new life begins...

An unbeliever's life is centered on his or her own personal gratification...

Those who do not follow Christ have only their own self-determination
as their source of power...

Now by contrast, God is at the center of a Christian's life.
God supplies the power for a Christian's daily living...

Believers find that their whole way of looking at the world
changes when they come to Christ...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the new life
that You provide for those who believe. I thank You
for How You provide the power to walk in the Light
when temptations surround us. You have given us so 
much to be thankful for, forgive me when I complain
about the little trials of life...Amen.

Keep looking up, for the power to overcome...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
