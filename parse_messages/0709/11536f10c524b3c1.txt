GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~"Fools despise wisdom and discipline"...

Our Meditation for Today:

Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God...

You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but 
by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone 
does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ...
(Ro. 8:8, 9) NIV

Our Thought for Today:
Have you ever worried about whether or not you really are a
Christian? A Christian is anyone who has the Spirit of God
living in him or her...

If you have sincerely trusted Christ for your salvation and
acknowledged Him as Lord, then the Holy Spirit lives within
you and you are a Christian...

You can be assured that you have the Holy Spirit because
Jesus promised that He would send Him. Since you now 
believe that Jesus Christ is God's Son and that eternal life
comes through Him (I Jn. 5:5) you will begin to act as Christ 
directs (Ro. 8:5; Gal. 5:22, 23); you will find help in your
daily problems and in your praying (Ro.8:26, 27)...

You will be empowered to serve God and do His will (Acts
1:8; Ro. 12:6ff; and you will become part of God's plan
to build up His church (Eph. 4:12, 13)

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for these assurances that
are mine by you presence in my life. Make me mindful of this
each and every day. Forgive me when I stumble...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is our light...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
