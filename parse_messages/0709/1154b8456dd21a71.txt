GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Knowing God's will for you will save you 
from the ways of the wicked...

Our Meditation for Today:

What we suffer now is nothing compared to the glory He will give us later.

For all creation is waiting eagerly for that future day when God will reveal
who His children really are...

Against its will, everything on earth was subject to God's curse...

All earth's creation anticipates the day when it will join God's children in
glorious freedom from death and decay...

For we know that all creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth
right up to the present time...(Ro. 8:18-22) NLT

Our Thought for Today:

Sin has caused all creation to fall from the perfect state in which God created it.
the world is in bondage to death and decay so that it can not fulfill its intended
purpose...

One day all creation will be liberated and transformed. But until that time we wait
in eager expectation for the resurrection of God's children...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I know the state of my being,
yet even so You promise to hear my prayers, and
so I come today asking again Your forgiveness for
my many sins and I thank You that You promise to
forgive and remember them no more and that You
will throw them as far as the east is from the west.
Keep our nation, its citizens and our troops safe...Amen.

Keep looking up, and He will keep blessing you...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
