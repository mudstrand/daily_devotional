GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~This is Tue. Devo. in case I don't get back 
from Moorhead before Tue morning...

Our Meditation for Tue:

The death He died, He died to sin once for all; 
but the life He lives, He lives to God.

In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin
but alive to God in Christ Jesus...(Ro. 6:10, 11 NIV

Our Thought for Tue.

To "Consider yourselves dead to sin" means that we should
regard our old sinful nature as dead and unresponsive to sin...

Because of our union and identification with Christ, we no longer
want to pursue our old plans, desires, and goals...

Now we want to live for the glory of God. As we start this new life,
the Holy Spirit will help us become all that Christ wants us to be...

Just remember to pray each morning that, 'today' you will be more
sensitive to His leading and guiding...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me of my sins of thought,
word, and deed...Help me to be more sensitive to Your
Holy Spirit's leading and guiding. I ask that You will keep
our nation, citizens, and troops safe. Bless my e-mail
friends with safety and good health...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is the answer to your prayers...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
