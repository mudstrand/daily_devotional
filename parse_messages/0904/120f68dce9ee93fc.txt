than your reputation...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"The God of all grace, who called you unto His eternal glory in Christ, 
shall Himself perfect, establish, strengthen you, after you have suffered
a little while." (I Pet. 5:10)

Our Lesson for Today:

We know how the Epistle to the Hebrews gathers up all its teaching in 
that wonderful promise, "the God of peace perfect you in every good 
work."

Peter does the same thing here: "The God of all grace perfect, stablish,
strengthen you." God Himself is to be the one object of our trust day by
day; as we think of our work, of our needs, of our life and all our hearts 
desire, YES God Himself must be the one object of our hope and trust...

So what now is our position to God? Do we feel that the first thought of
every day ought to be the humble placing of ourselves in His hands to
confess our absolute helplessness ~ do we yield ourselves in child-like
surrender to receive from Him the fulfillment of such promises as these:

"The God of peace perfect you in every good work."
"The God of all grace perfecting, stablishing, strengthening you"?

Let us meet God every morning and give Him time to reveal Himself
and to take charge of our life for the day.

By His grace may we awaken every morning to go out every morning
to do our work, humbly trusting in the word: "God shall Himself perfect 
you. The Lord will perfect that which concerns me."

Prayer Suggestion:
Help me to awaken every morning trusting in Your grace...
