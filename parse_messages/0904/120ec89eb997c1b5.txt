04/28/09~~~food for thought~~~The blessing of God come to us while on bended knees...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"That Christ may dwell in your heart by faith." (Eph. 3:14-19)

Our Lesson for Today:

The great privilege that separated Israel from other nations was this:
they had God dwelling in their midst, His Home in the Holiest of all in 
the tabernacle and the temple...

The New Testament is the dispensation of the indwelling God in the 
heart of His people. As Christ said (Jn. 14:21, 23), "If a man keep
My words, he it is that loveth Me; and My Father will love him, and
I will love Him, and we will come to him, and make our abode with
Him." This is what Paul calls "The riches of the glory of this mystery
among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory." Or,
as he says himself, "Christ liveth in me."

The Gospel ~ the dispensation of the indwelling Christ. How few
Christians there are who believe or experience it!

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord instill in me a child-like faith. Help me to hold
fast the confident assurance that God will do abundantly
above what we can ask or think...
