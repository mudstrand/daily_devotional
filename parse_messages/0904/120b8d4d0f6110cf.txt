04/18/09~~~food for thought~~~Christ is wanting a place in each of our hearts.
Have you laid out the welcome mat?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Abide in Me, and I in you." Jn. 15:4)

Our Lesson for Today:

To the feeblest of God's children Christ says: "You are in Me."
"Abide in Me. You shall bear much fruit."

To the strongest of His messengers He still has the word, there
can be nothing higher: "Abide in Me, and you shall bear much fruit."

To one and all the message comes: daily, continuous, unbroken
abiding in Christ Jesus is the one condition of a life of power and of
blessing...

Take time and let the Holy Spirit so renew in you the secret abiding 
in Him that you may understand the meaning of His words: "These
things have I spoken unto you that My joy might remain in you, and 
that your joy might be full."

Prayer Suggestion:
pray that you would not be tempted to stray from God's presence,
That is that you would continue to abide in Him...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
