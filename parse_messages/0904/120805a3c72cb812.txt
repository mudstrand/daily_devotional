Our Bible Verse for Today:
"I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel.
I will put My law in their inward parts, and in their hearts
I will write it." (Jer. 31:31, 33)

Our Lesson for Today:

When God made the first covenant with Israel at Sinai, He said, 
"If you will obey my voice indeed, and keep My covenant then 
you shall be a peculiar treasure unto Me among all peoples." 
(Ex. 19:5)

I had never given this any thought before, but Israel really didn't 
have the power to obey. Why? Because their whole nature was
carnal and sinful...

In that first covenant there was no provision for the grace that should
make them obedient. The law only served to show them their sin...

Now in our text God promises to make a new covenant in which provision
would be made to enable men to live a life of obedience. How?
Because in this new covenant, the law was to be put in their inward
parts and written in their heart, "not with ink, but with the Spirit of
the living God."

The lesson to be learned from the "new covenant" is that God's
mighty power will be shown in the heart of everyone who believes
the promise: "They shall not depart from me," "It shall be given 
so as it has been spoken unto Me."

Prayer Suggestion:
As you bow in deep stillness before God, pray that you will believe
what He says. The belief in God's power will assist you in remaining
faithful. Pray that the Lord Jesus would keep you "unblamable in
holiness."
