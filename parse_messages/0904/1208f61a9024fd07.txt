Our Bible Verses for Today:
"Call unto Me, and I will answer thee, and will show thee great
things, and difficult which thou knowest not" (Jer. 33:3)

"I the Lord have spoken it, and I will do it. For this moreover will 
I be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them." (Ezek. 36:36-37)

Our Lesson for Today:

The fulfillment of the great promises of the new covenant is made dependent
on prayer. In answer to the prayer of Jeremiah, God had said: "I will put my
fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me."

And to Ezekiel He had spoken: "I will cause them to walk in My statutes, and 
ye shall keep My judgments." 

To us in our unbelief and our judging of the meaning of God's Word according to
human thoughts and experience, there is no expectation of these promises being 
truly fulfilled...

We do not believe that God means them to be literally true. We do not have the faith
in the mighty power of God that is waiting to make His promise true in our experience...

Have we forgotten that God has said that without faith, our experience will be but
very partial and very limited?

God has very graciously point out the way in which such faith can be found...
It is in the path of much prayer.
"Call unto Me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great things
and difficult, which thou knowest not."

It is when we turn to God individually with our whole heart to plead these promises 
that He will fulfill them...

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray as the one who came to Jesus for help
"Lord I believe, Help my unbelief."
