Subject: Fw: The movie Corpus Christi











Hi, I think this is important, hope you will also


The movie Corpus Christi is due to be released
this June to August.
This film set to appear in America later this year
and it depicts Jesus and his disciples as homosexuals! As a play,
this has already been in theatres for a while. It's called Corpus
Christi ' which means 'The Christ Body..' It's a revolting mockery
of our Lord. But, we can make a difference. That's why I am sending
this e-mail to you. If you do send this around, we may be able to
prevent this film from showing in America and South Africa.

Apparently, some regions in Europe have already
banned the film. We need a lot of prayers and a lot of e-mails.
As a Christian I want to take a stand in what I believe in and stop 
the mockery of Jesus Christ our Savior.

At the risk of a bit of inconvenience, I'm forwarding this to all I 
think would appreciate it. Please help us prevent
such offenses against our Lord. It will take you less than 2
minutes! If you are not interested, and do not have the 2 Minutes it
will take to do this , please don't complain when God does not
have time for you because He is far busier than we are..

Remember, Jesus said 'Deny Me on earth and I'll deny you before my Father.
