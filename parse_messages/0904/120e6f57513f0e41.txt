04/27/09~~~food for thought~~~"A prayer without the name of Jesus is like a letter 
without a stamp ~ it ain't going anywhere."

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"I cease not to make mention of you in my prayers; that the God of 
our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you a spirit
of wisdom and revelation; having the eyes of your heart enlightened,
that ye may know what is the exceeding greatness of His power to
us-ward who believe, according to that working of the strength of His 
might which He wrought in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead."
(Eph. 1"16-20 R. V.)

Our Lesson for Today:

Here again we have one of those great texts in regard to which faith has 
to be exercised ~ words that will make our faith large and strong and bold...

Christ died on the tree under the weight of the sin of the world and its curse.
When He descended into the grave, it was under the weight of all that sin,
and the power of that death which had apparently mastered Him...

What a mighty working of the power of God, to raise that Man out of the grave
to the power and the glory of His throne. AND NOW it is that very same power
in the exceeding greatness of it toward us who believe, that by the teaching of
the Holy Spirit we are to know is working in us every day of our life...

The Lord who said to Abraham, "I am God Almighty, nothing is too hard for Me,"
comes to us with the message that what He did, not only in Abraham but in Christ
Jesus, is the pledge of what He is doing every moment in our hearts and will
do effectually, if we learn to trust Him.

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray that we would remember to pray for all believers that they may 
have their eyes opened to the wonderful vision of God's Almighty
resurrection power working in them...
