04/24/09~~~food for thought~~~We can do all things through Christ who strengthens us...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"That life which I now live in the flesh, I live in faith,
the faith which is in the Son of God, who love me
and gave Him self up for me." (Gal. 2:20 R. V. )

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul says that he no longer lives but that Christ lives in him, 
so the logical question one could ask, is what then is his part 
in living that life?

Well he gives us the answer" "The life that I now live in the flesh is 
the life of faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself 
up for me...

His whole life day after day and all day long, was an unceasing faith in 
the wonderful love that had given itself for him. Faith was and is the key. 
Faith was the power that possessed and permeated his whole being 
and his every action...

Here we have the simple but full statement of what the secret of the 
Christian life is. It is not faith only in certain promises of God or in certain 
blessings that we receive from Christ. It is a faith that has got a vision
of how entirely Christ gives Himself to the soul to be in the very deepest 
and fullest sense of the word, his life and all that it implies for every moment
of the day...

It is as essential as continuous breathing is to the support of our physical life.
True faith rests on that infinite love in which Christ gave Himself wholly for us...

Yes He loved us all, and He gave Himself for us all, and He wish to live in us all.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, reveal to me that inseparable union between Christ and 
me in which the consciousness of Christ's presence may become as 
natural to me as the consciousness of my own existence...
