04/22/09~~~food for thought~~~By living in Christ, sin shall no longer have dominion over you...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"Much more they which receive abundance of grace and
of the gift of righteousness, shall reign in life by one,
Jesus Christ." (Ro. 5:17)

"Reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin, but
alive unto God in Christ Jesus." (Ro. 6:11)

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul teaches us that our faith in Christ as our righteousness is to be
followed by our faith in Him as our life from the dead. He asks in (Ro. 6:3),
"Know ye not that all we who are baptized into Christ Jesus were 
baptized into His death?"

We were buried with Him and raised from the dead with Him. Just as in 
Adam all his children died, so all believers in Christ actually died too in Him.

"Our old man was crucified with Him." With Him we were raised from the dead. 
And now we are to count ourselves as actually "dead to sin and alive to God."

What our Lord said about our being in Him and having Him living His life in us
can only come true as the full power of the Holy Spirit is experienced. Paul
says in (Ro. 8:2) "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me
free from the law of sin and death," of which he had been complaining that
it had kept him in captivity. And then he adds, "That the requirements of the
law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."

Through the Spirit we enter into the glorious liberty of the children of God...

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray that the Father would open the eyes of all His children
to see what the power is of Christ living in them that they might
live a life of holiness and fruitfulness. Pray that they would all 
become dead to sin and alive onto God in Christ Jesus...
