05/01/09~~~food for thought~~~"He that abideth in Him, sinneth not."
God said it so it is true...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"Ye know that He was manifested to take away sins; and in Him
is no sin. Whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not." (I Jn. 3:5-6)

Our Lesson for Today:

In our text today John teaches how we can be kept from sinning:
"He that abideth in Christ sinneth not." 

Though there is sin in our nature, the abiding in Christ, in whom 
there is no sin, does indeed free us from the power of sin and 
enables us day by day to live so as to please God...

Let the soul that longs to be free from the power of sin take to
heart these simple but far-reaching words:

"In Him is no sin" and "Of God I am in Him." "He that establisheth
us in Christ is God."

As we seek to abide in Him in whom there is no sin, Christ will indeed 
live out His own life in us in the power of the Holy Spirit and fit us for a
life in which we always do things that are pleasing in His sight...

Prayer Suggestion:
Lord work in my heart according to your will all that is good, 
as I wait for Thee...
