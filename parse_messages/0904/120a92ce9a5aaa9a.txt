04/15/09~~~food for thought~~~Let us seek God's blessing before we 
make our decisions, not afterwards...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"If you keep My commandments, you shall
abide in My love." (Jn. 15:10)

Our Lesson for Today:

We often hear these questions: "How can I abide in Christ always?"
"How can I live wholly for Him?"

Instead of asking another human, make these questions your fervent
prayer...

But if we look more closely at our verse today the Lord gives a simple 
but far-reaching answer: "Keep My commandments."

This is the only, the sure, the blessed way of abiding in Him. The Lord says:
"If you keep My commandments, you shall abide in My love; even as I
have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love."

Loving obedience is the way to the enjoyment of His love...

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray that the Holy Spirit will make possible what is beyond our 
human reach: loving You, keeping Your commandments, and
abiding in Your love, then give thanks...
