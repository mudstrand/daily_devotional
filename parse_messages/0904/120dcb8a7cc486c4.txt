Our Bible Verses for Today:
But what ever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ...
What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing
greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord for whose sake I have lost
all things. I consider them rubbish that I may gain Christ. (Phil. 3:7, 8)

Our Lesson for Today:

In studding the promises Jesus gave His disciples in the last night, a possible
question arises, What was it that made just these men fit and worthy of the
high honor of being baptized with the Holy Spirit from heaven?

The answer is simple. When Christ called them, they forsook all and followed
Him. They denied themselves, even to the hating of their own life, and gave
themselves to obey His commands...

They followed Him to Calvary, and amid its suffering and death their hearts 
clung to Him alone. It was this that prepared them for receiving a share in 
His resurrection life and so become fit here on earth to be filled with the 
Spirit, even as He received the fullness of the Spirit from the Father in glory...

So Paul says, "I count all things as loss for Christ." So it must be with us too 
in order to share fully in the power of His resurrection. We need to remember
that we have been redeemed from the world, to live wholly and only for God and 
His love...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, let my faith boldly believe that such a life is meant for me.
Let my hearts desire reach out after nothing less than this. Let me
love Thee as Lord and Savior with my whole heart...
