Our Bible Verse for Today:
"As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My
thoughts higher than your thoughts." (Isa. 55:9)

Our Lesson for Today:

In giving us His promise of what He will work in us, God reminds us
that as high as the heavens are above the earth, so high are His
thoughts above ours. this is far above our spiritual apprehension...

When He tells us that we are made in His image, and that by grace 
we are actually renewed again into that image, and as we gaze upon
God's glory in Christ, we are changed into the same image as by the
Spirit of the Lord, THIS IS TRULY THOUGHTS HIGHER THAN THE HEAVENS...

Let us wait in reverence and humility and patience for God's grace to 
impart into our hearts the life and the light that can make us feel at home
with these thoughts dwelling in us...

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray that every day the Holy Spirit will fill
your heart with thoughts of God in all His
heavenly power and glory...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
