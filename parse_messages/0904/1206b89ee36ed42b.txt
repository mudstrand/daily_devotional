04/03/09~~~food for Thought~~~Think about this, it just may change your attitude:
You were created in the image of God...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
And God said, "Let us make man in our own image,
after our likeness." (Gen. 1:26)

Our lesson for Today:

Here we have the first thought of man, his origin and his destiny entirely
divine. In this verse we see that God undertook the work of making a
creature, who is not God, but to be a perfect likeness of Him in His divine
glory...(how do you measure up?)

Man was to live in entire dependence on God and to receive directly and 
unceasingly from God Himself the overflow of all that is holy and blessed 
in the Divine Being...(are you living up the God's requirements?)

God' glory, His holiness, and His love were to dwell in man and shine out 
through him...(not doing so well are you?)

Well don't fret, your not alone, neither am I or anyone else for that matter...

After sin had done its terrible work, it spoiled the image of God. But a promise
was given in Paradise that the seed of a woman would bring forth the Divine purpose,
"God's Son" He would become a Son of Man, in whom God's plan would be carried
out, His image in human form...

Now between the eternal purpose and its eternal realization, we have a wonderful 
promise in regard to our life here on earth. "We all, beholding the glory of the Lord, 
are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord".
(2 Cor. 3:18)

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray that God would keep our heart set upon the glory of 
the image of God in Christ Jesus, with the assurance that
the Spirit will change us into His image day by day, from
glory to glory...
