04/21/09~~~food for thought~~~We should never stop growing in our faith...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
All who believe are justified freely by God's grace through 
the redemption that came by Jesus Christ...(Ro. 3:24)

Our Lesson for Today:

Justification comes full and complete, As the eye of faith is fixed upon Christ. 
BUT that is only the beginning. Gradually believers must begin to understand 
that they are at the same time born again, that they have Christ in them, and 
that their calling now is to abide in Christ, and let Christ abide and live and 
work in them...

Most Christians strive, by holding fast their faith in justification, strengthening 
themselves for a life of gratitude and obedience. But we fail badly if we do not
in full faith yield ourselves to Christ, to maintain His life in us...

Oh yes many have learned from Abraham the first lesson, to believe in God
who justifies the ungodly. But many have not gone on to the second great
lesson, to believe in God who quickeneth the dead and daily renews that life 
through Christ who lives in them and in whose life alone there is strength and
fullness of blessing...

The Christian life must be "from faith to faith." The grace of pardon is but the 
beginning; growing in grace leads on to a fuller insight and experience of what
it is to be in Christ, to live in Him, and to grow up in Him in all things as the Head...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, lead me to a fuller insight and experience
of what it is to be in Christ...Amen.
