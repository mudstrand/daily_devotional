04/02/09~~~food for thought~~~Praise should always be a part of adoration...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Let the godly sing with joy to the Lord,
for it is fitting to praise Him...(Ps 33:1)

Our Lesson for Today:

Adoration, when it has entered God's presence and had fellowship
with Him, will ever lead to the praise of His name. We should let
praise be a part of the incense we bring before God in our quiet time...

In the Psalms we see what a large place praise ought to have in the 
spiritual life. There are more than sixty Psalms of praise, becoming 
more frequent as the book draws to its close...

We should study the Psalms more closely until our whole heart and
life are one continual song of praise...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, in my quiet time with You may I
always offer a heart filled with unceasing praise...Amen.

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
