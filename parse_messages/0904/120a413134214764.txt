04/14/09~~~food for thought~~~Remember that the things that are impossible
for man are possible with God...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Because I live, you shall live also...(Jn. 14:19)

Our Lesson for Today:

Christ says, "I live, and you shall live also." The disciples were to receive
from Him not the life that He then had, but the resurrection life in the power
of its victory over death and of His exaltation to the right hand of God...

He would from then on always dwell with them; a new, a heavenly, an eternal
life, the life of Jesus Himself, should fill them...

And this promise is to all who will accept it in faith...

Oh, how many there are who are content with the beginnings of the Christian 
life but never long to have it in its fullness, the more abundant life!!!

I pray that you, do take time, and let Christ's wonderful promise take possession
of your heart. Be content with nothing less than a full salvation, Christ living in you,
and you living in Christ.

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray that you will always be sensitive to Christ's promise and will
believe that the Almighty power of God will work in you the mighty 
wonder of His grace, Christ dwelling in your heart by faith...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
