>Paddy had been drinking at his local Dublin pub all day
>and most of the night celebrating St Patrick's Day. Mick, the bartender
>says, 'You'll not be drinking anymore tonight, Paddy'. Paddy replies, 'OK
>Mick, I'll be on my way then'. Paddy spins around on his stool and steps
>off. He falls flat on his face. 'Damn' he says and pulls himself up by the
>stool and dusts himself off. He takes a step towards the door and falls
>flat on his face,

>He looks to the doorway and thinks to himself that if he can just get to
>the door and some fresh air he'll be fine. He belly crawls to the door and
>shimmies up to the door frame. He sticks his head outside and takes a deep
>breath of fresh air, feels much better and takes a step out onto the
>sidewalk and falls flat on his face.

>'By'Jeebers.... I'm a little crocked,' he says.

>He can see his house just a few doors down, and crawls to the door, hauls
>himself up the door frame, opens the door and shimmies inside. He takes a
>look up the stairs and says 'No damn' way'. He crawls up the stairs to his
>bedroom door and says 'I can make it to the bed'. He takes a step into the
>room and falls flat on his face. He says ' Damn it ' and falls into bed.

>The next morning, his wife, Jess, comes into the room carrying a cup of
>coffee and says, 'Get up Paddy. Did you have a bit to drink last night ?'
