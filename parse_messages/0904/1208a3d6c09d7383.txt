04/09/09~~~food for thought~~~If we but believe in God's promises they will work...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean;
from all your filthiness will I cleanse you. And I will put My
Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in My statutes, and
you shall keep My judgments." (Ezek. 36:25-27)

Our Lesson for Today:

Here we have the same promise as in Jeremiah, the promise of such
heart cleansing from sin and such a gift of the Spirit in the new heart
that it would secure their walking in His statutes that and they would 
keep all His judgments...

The wonderful mark of the new covenant would be a Divine power 
enabling them to walk in His Statutes and keep His judgments...

Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound," working whole-
hearted allegiance and obedience. Why is this experienced so little? 
The answer is simple: The promise is not believed, is not preached; 
and so its fulfillment is not expected...

Oh let us begin to believe that the promise will come true: 
"I will cleanse you from all your filthiness, and you shall be clean;
and will cause you to walk in My statutes, and you shall keep them...

Let us believe all that God promises here, and God will do it...

Prayer Suggestion:
pray for such faith that the promise will work in you.
Pray that each day the promise would be seen in you...
