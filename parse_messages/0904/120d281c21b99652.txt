04/23/09~~~food for thought~~~We have victory over sin because of Christ's sacrifice...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"I have been crucified with Christ; yet I live; and yet
no longer I, but Christ liveth in me." (Gal. 2:20)

Our Lesson for Today:

As in Adam we died out of the life and the will of God into sin and
corruption, but in Christ we are made partakers of a new spiritual
death, a death to sin and into the will and life of God...

Such was the death that Christ died; such is the death we are made
partakers with Him.,,

To Paul this was such a reality that He was able to say: "I have been
crucified with Christ yet I live; and yet no longer I, but Christ liveth 
in me."

The death with Christ had had such power that Paul no longer lived his 
own life; Christ lived His life in him. Paul had died to the old nature and
to sin and been raised up into the power of the living Christ dwelling in 
him...

Christ's death on the cross was His highest exhibition of His holiness
and victory over sin. And every believer who receives Christ is made
a partaker of all the power and blessing that the crucified Lord has won...

Prayer Suggestion:
Give thanks for the blessedness of the power of faith that has been 
given to us that enables us to live day by day counting ourselves and 
yielding ourselves to Him as indeed dead to sin and alive to Him in 
Christ Jesus...
