Our Bible Verse for Today:
"For I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins will
I remember no more." Heb. 8:12)

Our Lesson for Today:

In this Epistle Christ is called the Mediator of a better covenant
enacted upon better promises. (8:6) In Him the two parts of the 
covenant find their complete fulfillment...

First of all, He came to atone for sin so that its power over man 
was destroyed and free access to God's presence and favor was
secured. And with that came the fuller blessing, the new heart, freed
from the power of sin, with God's Holy Spirit breathing into it the delight
in God's law and the power to obey it...

These two parts of the covenant may never be separated. And yet,
how many there are who put their trust in Christ for the forgiveness
of sin and yet never think of claiming the fullness of the promise, the
new heart, cleansed from sin, with the Holly Spirit breathing it in such love
and delight in God's law and such power to obey, that they have access
to the full blessing of the new covenant, being God's people and knowing 
Him as their God...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus You are my Lord and Master, my heart and
life are fully Yours...
