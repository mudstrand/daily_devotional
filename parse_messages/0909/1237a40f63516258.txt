09/02/09~~~food for thought~~~God's unchanging love leads God to action...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
I have loved you with an everlasting love. With unfailing love
I have drawn you to Myself...(Jer. 31:3)

Our Lesson for Today:
I remember one time [many years ago] in which I received a 
picture of a friend, on the back she had written, "I love you with 
all my heart. I will love you forever." But under her signature was 
this PS: "If we ever break up, I want this picture back."

God's love doesn't change with the wind or passing emotions.
God's love is permanent and so is what He in His love has done
for us...

When He says, "[I] so loved the world that [I] gave [My] one and 
only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have
eternal life" (Jn. 3:16), that's as true today as it was when His words 
were recorded more than 2,000 years ago...

When the apostle wrote, "He [God] loved us and sent His Son as
an atoning sacrifice for our sins" (I Jn. 4:10), that stands for us just 
as for those who first read John's words...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord I thank You for the assurance of Your
unchanging love...Amen.
