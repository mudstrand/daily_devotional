09/12/09~~~food for thought~~~The fare has been paid...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
God presented Him [Jesus] as a sacrifice of atonement,
through faith in His blood...(Ro. 3:25)

Our Lesson for Today:
Heading back to our room while in Hawaii some years ago we boarded a
bus and went directly to our seats, the bus driver said "Hey you have to pay
the fare," so I showed him my pass for the day...

The bus driver was right you have to pay to ride...

It is somewhat the same principle with the road to heaven. Someone has
to pay for the ticket. Only this time it was the eternal Son of God...

God is a holy God who can't just wink at sin as if it were of no account.
He can't just sweep my many transgressions under the rug as if they
didn't matter...

Scriptures say very clearly, "The wages of sin is death" (Ro. 6:23).
The price required was extremely high...

Again the Bible says emphatically, "Without the shedding of blood
there is no forgiveness" (Heb. 9:22), the fare for heavens bus was 
not cheap. It cost God the best He had - His own Son...

Jesus paid my fare to heaven with His holy, precious blood...

How do we get a ticket on that wonderful bus?
Through faith in His blood ~ and the finished work of the cross...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, thank you for sin's payment. Help me
hold on to the free ticket to heaven you gave me...Amen.
