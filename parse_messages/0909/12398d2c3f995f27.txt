09/08/09~~~food for thought~~~True happiness is being merciful...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Blessed are the merciful, for they will be
shown mercy." (Mt. 5:7)

Our Lesson for Today:
True mercy begins in the heart and leads to action.
It involves both heart and hand... Want an example???

How about our Lord? He didn't just say of the world which was speeding to Hell:
"That's to bad ~ I cry for you." NO! His mercy kicked into high gear. He sent His
Son to rescue sinners from hell...

In daily life He also shows abundant mercy. He doesn't just say "I feel sorry for
those foolish people," and then let us blow our world to ribbons, or let our
worries drive us out of our minds, or our illnesses run unchecked...

His mercy acts ~ Every day in every phase of life His mercy takes care of us...

"Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy," Jesus says.

He knew how difficult showing mercy could be in this world. So He encourages 
me with His promise to show me mercy in every need...

What a Lord I have ~ First He makes me merciful by bringing me faith,
then He promises me more mercy when I try to be like Him toward those
in need... In His promise we can all have happiness...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, scrub the selfishness out of my heart
by showering Your mercy upon me...Amen.
