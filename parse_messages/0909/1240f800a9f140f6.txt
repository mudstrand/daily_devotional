10/01/09~~~food for thought~~~DONE BY ME OR FOR ME?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Come, you who are blest by My Father; take your inheritance,
the Kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world...(Mt. 25:34)

Our Lesson for Today:
Faith is invisible. No one can look into another's heart to see whether
faith is there. And yet faith is very visible. On the last day, Jesus will 
point to faith visible in the lives of believers...

He will reference the works they have done as outward indication of 
the invisible faith in their hearts. Unfortunately, some still misunderstand 
that salvation is something done for us not by us...

We need to note that Jesus uses the word inheritance. An inheritance 
is a gift from the donor not some wage earned by my efforts...

So the kingdom of heaven is God's free gift, graciously willed to me because 
of what His Son has done...

To make it even clearer, Jesus calls it the kingdom prepared "for you" not
"by you." God has done all the work...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, When I stand in glory at Your side, all my praise
shall be that You did it all for me...Amen.
