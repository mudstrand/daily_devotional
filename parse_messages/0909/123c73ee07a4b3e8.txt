09/17/09~~~food for thought~~~AN ANCHOR THAT HOLDS

Our Bible Verse for Today:
We have this hope (Jesus) as an anchor for the soul,
firm and secure...(Heb. 6:19)

Our Lesson for Today:
Have you ever flown a kite and all of a sudden the string broke and
the kite just sailed off and crashed???

Like that kite our salvation needs a string or as our verse pictures it, 
an anchor. But, an anchor is only as good as the ground into which it 
sinks its flukes...

Water surely won't work, neither will sand for very long. To hold the boat
securely, the anchor needs to be imbedded in the right ground...

The only anchor in which there is hope of salvation is Jesus Christ.
Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under 
heaven given to men by which we must be saved...(Acts 4:12)

This is also made very clear in (Jn. 14:6) "I am the way and the truth 
and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me."
The Savior Himslf says... 

Yes when we have a personal relationship with Christ, we have our anchor 
in the right spot...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me continue to realize that my hope of 
salvation can be built on nothing less than Jesus' blood
and righteousness...Amen.
