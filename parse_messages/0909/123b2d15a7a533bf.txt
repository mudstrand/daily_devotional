Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Whoever comes to Me I will never drive away." (Jn. 6:37)

Our Lesson for Today:
"What's she doing here?" whispered a member to her neighbor
in the church pew. Across the aisle a lady, who everyone knew had 
a shady reputation, had just sat down...

Was that member correct? Little did the critic know that the pastor 
had encouraged the sinner to come. Earlier in the week she had sat
in the pastor's office, sobbing out her repentance, seeking forgiveness
for what she knew was wrong...

"Your sins are forgiven," the pastor had assured her. "Come to worship
next Sunday," he encouraged her, "and hear even more of that forgiveness."

In this world, though we claim not to, we set up pecking orders. Somewhat
a sinner, more so a sinner, and very much a sinner are the categories into 
which we sort people...

And unfortunately we do the same when Christ welcomes a sinner. Have we 
forgotten what the Savior Himself said? He won't drive away any sinner who 
comes to Him in repentance...

He has no sin-o-meter that weighs one sin more heavily than anther,
no list of the 10 or 20 worst sinners...

Just full forgiveness to everyone...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, remind me that the chief of sinners though
I be, you shed your blood for me...Amen.
