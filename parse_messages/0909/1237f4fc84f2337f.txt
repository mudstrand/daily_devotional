09/03/09~~~food for thought~~~Laboring for what?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
God said to him, "You fool! this very night your life
will be demanded of you." (Lk. 12:20)

Our Lesson for Today:
As you know this is the month we observe Labor Day, have you asked 
yourself the question "What am I laboring for? Is it for how much I can 
get or how much I can keep???

Jesus calls the man in the parable a "fool" not because of his laboring
but because all he could talk about was "I" and "Mine"...

All that man could think about was how much he could get. The same temptation
is there for us. We eat vitamin-enriched foods, ride in air-conditioned cars,
whatch TV programs beamed across the miles, lose our anxieties by taking
pills, die without pain because of modern drugs, and are laid to rest in park-like
cemeteries...

All this we have and most of it is good...

But what good is my life if it revolves only around these things...

As the man in the parable ~ we cannot prolong our life a single second, pay God
for a single sin, or buy one square inch of heaven...

Are you too asking the wrong question, one about getting instead of giving???
To be rich toward God means to treasure the pardon He has prepared for us
in Christ, to use our earthly treasures for the spreading of His Word, to look forward 
to our rich inheritance with Him in heaven...

Labor? For what?

The question is simple, deceptively so. The answer is serious, eternally so...

Prayer suggestion:
Dear Lord, give me the right answer in the Savior
Jesus Christ...Amen.
