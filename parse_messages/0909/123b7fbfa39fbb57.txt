09/14/09~~~food for thought~~~HIS HEART WAS MADE UP...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
As the time approached for Him to be taken up to
heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem...(Lk. 9:51).

Our Lesson for Today:
When my mom gets a certain look on her face, we know her
mind is made up. nothing we can say or do or ask will change
it...

"Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem," our verse says.
Nothing could stop Him from what lay ahead, He knew what
awaited Him in Jerusalem and out on Calvary. He even told His
disciples several times in advance...

The rejection by His countrymen and the betrayal by His friend, 
hurry-up trials before the Jewish court and the Roman judge, the 
crown of thorns and the awful whip, the crude cross and the flesh-
splitting nails, the sun-drained darkness of Calvary and the soul-
draining depths of hell's punishment ~ all this Jesus knew about...

Yet He resolutely set out for Jerusalem.

"Why did Jesus die on the cross?" a five-year-old boy's mom asked
as they talked about his Sunday school lesson. After a moment of
silence, the boy answered, "Because He couldn't get off."

In a sense the little boy was right. Jesus had more than enough power 
to turn His journey to Jerusalem into something far different than an 
ending on the cross. BUT HIS LOVE WOULDN'T LET HIM...

His love for sinners brought Him to that cross and kept Him on it.
There His love poured the lifeblood from His sacred veins for sinners 
like me. His heart was made up. And that is why He went to Jerusalem...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, fix my eyes of faith resolutely on
Jesus' cross as the only salvation for Sinners...Amen.
