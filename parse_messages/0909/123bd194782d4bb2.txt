09/15'09~~~food for thought~~~TEACHER OF THE WORLD

Our Bible Verse for Today:
The people were amazed at His teaching, because He
taught them as one who had authority...(Mk. 1:22)

Our Lesson for Today:
"Congratulations, Mrs. so-and-so, teacher of the year," said the 
sign on the brick wall of the middle school. Students had nominated 
her, the panel had selected her, and she received recognition...

They weren't handing out awards that day in the synagogue at Capernaum,
but they did recognize Jesus as a good teacher. They sat there amazed, 
with mouths wide open...

It makes one wish that Mark would have recorded Jesus' sermon. But
he didn't. He does, however, tell us why the people were so awestruck
by Jesus' teaching. It was because "He taught them as one who had
authority." It makes me wish I was there...

But in His Word, Jesus speaks to us. The Bible is Jesus' voice. In it He 
teaches us the same beautiful truth ~ that because of His redemption,
we have eternal life in heaven, (We who have him in our hearts)...

That message of divine love still brings astonishment to the ears of
the sinner. What a teacher of the world Jesus is!!!

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, open my ears to hear the news of
salvation and my heart to rejoice because of
it...Amen.
