09/21/09~~~food for thought~~~NO NEED FOR A CELL PHONE...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
God is . . . an ever-present help in trouble...(Ps. 46:1)

Our Lesson for Today:
A great number of us carry cell phones while traveling today
so in case of trouble we can call 911 and help will soon be
on the way...

As a believer I don't need a cell phone to call God to my side.
He is there all the time. "An ever-present help in trouble" is how 
the Psalmist describes Him...

My greatest trouble is sin. It's at the root of all the worlds problems.
Sin is the soil in which the troubles of man grow ~ all his pains,
temptations, even death...

Every day the dandelions of sin shoot up in my heart, threatening to
choke out all else. Daily I must confess that I sin much and deserve 
nothing but punishment...

So what do I do? ~ Pick up the cell phone and call 911?

Man can't help me, but God did. He sent His Son to pay sin's penalty
and destroy sin's curse...

On the cross he provided the only help that works, His Son's blood
in payment for all my sins and as power against sin's temptations...

Through His Word He stands at my (our) side with that forgiveness.
His Word is our "cell phone."

Prayer Suggestion:
Be near me Lord Jesus, to help me with my sins and 
bless me with Your forgiveness...Amen.

Ps. We're leaving on vacation Tue - or Wed.
