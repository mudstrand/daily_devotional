Happiness is being persecuted for Him...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Blessed are those who are persecuted because of
righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven...(Mt. 5:10)

Our Lesson for Today:
As I read this verse I became aware of how far removed I can be 
at times from this beatitude! I was reminded of how much I will do 
to avoid being persecuted for following Jesus...

Its true I go places, laugh at jokes, do things I shouldn't so that the 
world around me won't pick on me. How often I'm hesitant to stand 
up for Jesus, much less suffer for Him...

I'll slip into the shadows of silence instead of speaking up for what His 
Word says. I'll even pull back when He asks some service or offering
from me, so I won't be inconvenienced...

We need to remember, Jesus doesn't talk about taking up a pillow
and following Him ~ He mentions a cross...

Jesus doesn't promise that the road of discipleship will be without a 
bump or danger from competing traffic. He describes our life as a race
that requires every ounce of our endurance and every minute of faith's
concentration...

I hate to ask the question, 
but could it be that we haven't found the world to be such a severe 
enemy because we've been too much of a friend with the world?

Let's all take a moment to take stock of the road we have been traveling?

Prayer Suggestion:
Lord Help me find happiness in standing up for
Jesus and His Word in this hostile world...Amen.
