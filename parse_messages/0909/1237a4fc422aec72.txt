Fw: SOCIAL SECURITY 2009 .....






2010 is an election year for 1/3 of the senate and all of the house of representatives. It would be nice if congress got the message; the voting taxpayers are in charge now. 



Social Security 2009 


LET US SHOW OUR LEADERS IN WASHINGTON "PEOPLE POWER" AND THE POWER OF THE INTERNET. 
PLEASE FORWARD TO ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS. 
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU ARE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT! 

KEEP IT GOING!!!! 

Propose this in 2009: 

START A MOVEMENT TO PLACE ALL POLITICIANS ON SOCIAL SECURITY 


------------ --------- --------- ---- 

SOCIAL SECURITY: 

(This is worth reading. It is short and to the point.) 

Perhaps we are asking the wrong questions during election years. 

Our Senators and Congresswomen do not pay into Social Security and, of course, they do not collect from it. 

You see, Social Security benefits were not suitable for persons of their rare elevation in society. They felt they should have a special plan for themselves So, many years ago they voted in their own benefit plan. 

In more recent years, no congress person has felt the need to change it. After all, it is a great plan. 

For all practical purposes their plan works like this: 

When they retire, they continue to draw the same pay until they die. 
Except it may increase from time to time for cost of living adjustments. ..... 

For example, Senator Byrd and Congressman White and their wives may expect to draw $7,800,000.00 (that's Seven Million, Eight- Hundred Thousand Dollars), with their wives drawing 
$275,000 during the last years of their lives. 
This is calculated on an average life span for each of those Dignitaries. 

Younger Dignitaries who retire at an early age, will receive much more during the rest of their lives. 

Their cost for this excellent plan to them is $0.00. NADA!!! ZILCH!!! 

This little perk they voted for themselves is free to them. You and I pick up the tab for this plan. The funds for this fine retirement plan come directly from the General Funds; 

"OUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK"! 

From our own Social Security Plan, which you and I pay (or have paid) into, every payday until we retire (which amount is matched by our employer), We can expect to get an average of 
$1,000 per month after retirement. 

Or, in other words, we would have to collect our average of $1,000 monthly benefits for 68 years and one (1) month to equal Senator Bill Bradley's benefits! 
Social Security could be very good if only one small change were made. 

That change would be to 

Jerk the Golden Fleece Retirement Plan from under the Senators and Congressmen. . Put them into the Social Security plan with the rest of us 

Then sit back.... 

And see how fast they would fix it! 

If enough people receive this, maybe a seed of awareness will be planted and maybe good changes will evolve. 


How many people can YOU send this to? 

Better yet...... 
How many people WILL you send this to ?
