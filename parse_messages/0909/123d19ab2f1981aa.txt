09/19/09~~~food for thought~~~SAFE IN GOD'S ARMS...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
God is our refuge...(Psalm 46:1)

Our Lesson for Today:
How unprotected people must feel who don't know about God's mighty arms!
How afraid are those who don't trust His arms to hold them safely!

When their sins crash into them like a speeding car, where do they turn?
When life's uncertainties spook them, what's their refuge?
When their last day draws near, and they stand before the judge, what's their hiding place?

Thank God for my Father's arms.
Because of Jesus' payment for sins, those arms are there for me.
Because of the Spirit's gift of faith, I trust those arms...

When Satan comes stalking me like some roaring lion seeking to sink his teeth into my soul,
I find strength in God's protecting arms...

When sin has done its daily damage to my soul, I find forgiveness each night in God's loving arms.
When life's storm clouds gather over me, I find shelter in God's almighty arms...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, cover my defenseless head with
the shadow of Thy wing...Amen.

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
