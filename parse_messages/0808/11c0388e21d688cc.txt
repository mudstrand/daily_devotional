08/27/08~~~(food for thought)~~~If a care is to small to be turned into a prayer,
it is to small to be made into a burden. (I Pet 5:7)

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Anyone who receives instruction in the word must share all good
things with his instructor... (Gal. 6:6) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul says, that as students of God's word it is our responsibility
to take care of the material needs of our teachers (I Cor 9:7-12).

It is easy to receive the benefits of good Bible teaching and then take
our spiritual leaders for granted, ignoring their financial and physical 
needs... 

We should care for our teachers, not grudgingly or reluctantly, 
but with a generous spirit, showing honor and appreciation 
for all they have done (I Tim. 5:17, 18).

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to always remember 
the needs of my pastor so that I might truly share of
the blessing I have received from You. Give me a more 
generous spirit I pray in Jesus name...Amen.

Keep looking up, that you may receive, 
a more generous spirit...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
