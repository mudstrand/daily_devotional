Reference: LIFE 


This is God. Today I will be handling All of your problems for you. I do Not need your help. So, have a nice day. 

I love you. 


P.S. And, remember... 

If life happens to deliver a situation to you that you cannot handle, do Not attempt to resolve it yourself! Kindly put it in the SFGTD (something for God to do) box. I will get to it in MY TIME. All situations wi l l be resolved, but in My time, not yours. 


Once the matter is placed into the box, do not hold onto it by worrying about it.. Instead, focus on all the wonderful things that are present in your life now. 

Should you decide to send this to a friend; Thank you. You may have touched their life in ways you will never know!!! 

Now, you have a nice day.

God 


God has seen you struggling, 

God says it's over. 

A blessing is coming your way. If you believe inGod, please send to ten people (including me) please don't ignore this.
You are being tested. 


YOU HAVE 20 MINUTES TO TELL 10 FRIENDS THAT YOU LOVE THEM (INCLUDING ME) SO I LOVE YOU! GO!
