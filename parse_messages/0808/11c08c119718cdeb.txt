the fact that he uses his head...(2 Tim 4:5)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what
he sows...

The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will
reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the 
Spirit will reap eternal life...(Gal. 6:7, 8) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

It would certainly be surprising if we plant corn and pumpkins came up.
it's a natural law that we reap what we sow...

It's true in other areas too. If you gossip about friends, you will lose
their friendship. Every action has results...

If you plant to please your own desires, you'll reap a crop of sorrow
and evil. If you plant to please God, you'll reap joy and everlasting life.

let us examine closely the kind of seeds we have been sowing!

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for all my ill planted
seeds. I truly want to plant seeds which are pleasing to
You because I want to reap joy and everlasting life.
Bless all my e-mail friends today with safety and good health...Amen

Keep looking up, for the seeds which are pleasing to God...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
