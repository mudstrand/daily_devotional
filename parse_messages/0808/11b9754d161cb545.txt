Our Bible verse for Today:

Paul asks, "Have I now become your enemy by telling
you the truth? (Gal 4:16) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

The one thing we should notice in Paul's writings to the Galatians is that 
he did not gain great popularity when he rebuked them, for turning away
from their first faith in Christ...

I think that we would all have to agree that human nature hasn't changed 
much ~ we still get angry when we are scolded. But we shouldn't write 
off someone who challenges us...

There may be truth in what he/she says. We should receive their words 
with humility, carefully thinking them over...

When we discover that we need to change our attitude or actions, we 
should take steps to do so...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, help me by Your Holy Spirit,
to make a close examination of my attitude and actions.
Help me develop a more Christ-like attitude...Amen.

keep looking up, for the Spirit's help...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
