08/12/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ Our faith should not rest in the wisdom of men
but in the power of God...(Ps. 119:28) KJV

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul says, "A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough."
I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one 
who is throwing you into confusion will pay the penalty, whoever he
may be...(Gal. 5:9,10) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Most generally when the word 'yeast' is used in the Bible it
is referring to sin our evil...

A little yeast causes the whole lump of dough to rise, means
that it only takes one wrong person to infect all the others...

This reminds me of what my uncle used to say, "You let the devil
have you little finger and he will take your whole hand."

Sin is an infectious disease, so remember to always take a 
healthy does of God's word each morning...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that I would always remember
to take a healthy does of Your Word each and every day so
that I would become more immune to sin...Amen.

Keep looking up, for an immunity to sin...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
