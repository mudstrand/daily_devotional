Our Bible Verse for Today:

Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit...
(Gal 5:25)

Our Lesson for Today:

We need to keep in mind that God is interested in every part of 
our life, not just the spiritual part. As we live by the Holy Spirit's
power, we need to submit every aspect of our life to God: emotional,
physical, social, intellectual, vocational...

Paul says that because we're saved, we should live like it!!!

The Holy Spirit is the source of our new life, so we should keep in step
with his leading. Don't let anything or anyone else determine your
values and standards in any area of your life...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your loving presence
in every area of my life. I thank You for Your Holy Spirit's
guidance, help me keep in step with His leading...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is there to guide you...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
