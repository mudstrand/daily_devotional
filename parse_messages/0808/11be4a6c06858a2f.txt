08/21/08~~~(food for thought)~~~The by-products of the Spirit-filled life are in perfect
harmony with the intent of God's law...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature with
its passions and desires...(Gal 5:24) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

In order to accept Christ as Savior, we need to turn from our sins and
willingly nail our sinful nature to the cross...

This doesn't mean, however, that we will never see traces of its evil
desires again. As Christians we still have the capacity to sin, but we 
have been set free from sin's power over us and no longer have to give
in to it...

We must daily commit our sinful tendencies to God's control, daily
crucifying them, and moment by moment draw on the Spirit's power to
overcome them. (look to Gal. 2:20 and Gal. 6:14).

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that you would help me over-come
my sinful tendencies. Help me become more and more sensitive 
to Your Spirit's power. Bless all my e-mail friends with good health 
and safety...Amen.

Keep looking up, We all need His help...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
