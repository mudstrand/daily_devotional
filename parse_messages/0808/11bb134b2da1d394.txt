08/10/08~~~(food for thought)~~~Love is the best expression of faith...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision 
has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing
itself through love...(Gal. 5:6) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

We have heard this statement over and over ~ but as humans
we need this reminder "We are saved by faith, not by deeds."

Love for God and for others should be the response of those 
whom God has forgiven...

God's forgiveness is complete, and Jesus said that, "Those 
who are forgiven much love much (Lk. 7:47). The reason being 
is that faith expresses itself through love...

You can check your love for others as a way to monitor your faith.

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I must confess that my love for
others is not always as it should be, please forgive me
and give me a Christ-like love...Amen.

Keep looking up, He answers prayer...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
