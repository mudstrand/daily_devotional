08/09/08 ~~~ (food for thought)~~~God's peace is more precious than 
all the world's riches..

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, 
Christ will be of no value to you at all...

Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is 
obligated to obey the whole law...

You who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from Christ; 
you have fallen away from grace...(Gal. 5:2-4) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Trying to be saved by keeping the law and being saved by grace
are two entirely different approaches. "Christ will be of no value"
means that Christ's provision for our salvation will not help us if
we are trying to save ourselves...

All we can do is accept His gracious gift through faith. Our deeds
of service must never be used to try and earn God's love or favor...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the gracious gift 
of salvation. Forgive me for the times I have drifted from 
faith into a mode of good deeds and feeling proud of
my Christianity. I know that I can in no way save myself,
BUT Satan is always at my doorstep. Please remove the 
welcome mat when he is near...Amen.

Keep looking up, He has prepared the way...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
