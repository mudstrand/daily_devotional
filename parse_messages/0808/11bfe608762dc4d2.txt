08/26/08~~~(food for thought)~~~Those who bury their talents are making
a grave mistake...(I Tim 4:14a)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Each one should test his own actions. then he can take pride
in himself without comparing himself to somebody else,

for each one should carry his own load...(Gal. 6:4, 5) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

When we do our very best, we feel good about the results. There is
no need to compare ourselves with others. People make comparisons
for many reasons...

Some point out the flaws in others in order to feel better about themselves.
others simply want reassurance that they are doing well.

When you are tempted to compare, look at Jesus Christ. His example
will inspire you to do your very best, and His loving acceptance will
comfort you when you fall short of your expectations...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Forgive me for making comparisons with
anybody else but You. Help me to model my life after Yours. I
thank You again for Your love and mercy...Amen.

Keep looking up, and you will find a pattern 
for your life...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
