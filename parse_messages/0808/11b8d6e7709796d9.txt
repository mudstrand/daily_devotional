Cherokee Indian


Do you know the legend of the Cherokee Indian youth's rite
of Passage?

His father takes him into the forest, blindfolds him and
leaves him alone. He is required to sit on a stump the whole
night and not remove the blindfold until the rays of the
morning sun shine through it. He cannot cry out for help to
anyone. Once he survives the night, he is a MAN.

He cannot tell the other boys of this experience, because
each lad must come into manhood on his own. The boy is
naturally terrified. He can hear all kinds of noises. Wild
beasts must surely be all around him. Maybe even some human
might do him harm.. The wind blew the grass and earth, and
shook his stump, but he sat stoically, never removing the
blindfold. It would be the only way he could become a man!

Finally, after a horrific night the sun appeared and he
removed his blindfold. It was then that he discovered his
father sitting on the stump next to him. He had been at
watch the entire night, protecting his son from harm. We,
too, are never alone. Even when we don't know it, God is
watching over us, sitting on the stump beside us. When
trouble comes, all we have to do is reach out to Him. If you
liked this story, pass it on. If not, you took off
your blindfold before dawn.

Moral of the story: Just because you can't see God, doesn't
mean He is not there. 'For we walk by faith, not by sight.'

The Lord Himself goes before you and will be with you;
He will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; 
do not be discouraged....(Deut. 31:8)
