08/13/08~~~(food for thought)~~~Jesus is a friend who walks in when
the world walks out...(Jn. 16:33).

Our Bible Verses for Today:

As for those agitators, I wish they would go all the way and
emasculate themselves!

You, my brothers, were called to be free. but do not use your
freedom to indulge the sinful nature; rather, serve one another
in love...(Gal. 5:12, 13).

Our Lesson for Today:

What Paul is doing here is distinguishing between freedom to sin
and the freedom to serve...

Freedom or license to sin is no freedom at all, because it enslaves
us to Satan, others, or our own sinful nature. Christians by contrast, 
should not be slaves to sin, because they are free to do right and 
glorify God through loving service to others...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, in Your loving mercy, forgive me 
for taking my freedom to extreme. Help me to use my 
freedom in loving service to You and others...Amen.

Keep looking up, in loving service to Him...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
