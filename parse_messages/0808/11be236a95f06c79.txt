08/20/08~~~(food for thought)~~~A person who exhibits the fruit of the Spirit, fulfills the law far better 
than a person who observes rituals with very little love in his heart...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
goodness, faithfulness,

gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.
(Gal. 5:22, 23)

Our Lesson for Today:

The fruit of the Spirit is the spontaneous work of the Holy Spirit in us.
The Spirit produces these character traits that are found in the nature
of Christ...

They are the by-products of Christ's control ~ we can't obtain them by 
trying to get them without His help. If we want the fruit of the Spirit to
grow in us, we must join our life to His. (see Jn. 15:4, 5)...

We must know Him, love Him, remember Him, and imitate Him. As a
result, we will fulfill the intended purpose of the law ~ to love God and
our neighbors...

Which of these qualities do you want the Spirit to produce in you?

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, create in me a Christ-like spirit, help me
to grow in humility and love...Amen.

Keep looking up, He answers prayer...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
