05/02/2010~~~food for thought~~~IT'S THE SPIRIT THAT COUNTS...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Jesus says: "I will send you the Counselor - the Spirit of Truth.
He will come to you from the Father and will tell you about me.
(Jn. 15:26)

Our Lesson for Today:
Here again Jesus offers hope.The Holy Spirit gives us the strength to endure
the unreasonable hatred and evil in our world and the hostility many have toward 
Christ. ~ This is especially comforting for those facing persecution...

Jesus uses two names for the Holy Spirit ~ "Counselor" and "Spirit of Truth."
The word Counselor stands for the encouraging, and strengthening work of the Spirit.
Spirit of Truth points to the teaching, illuminating, and reminding work of the Spirit.
The Holy Spirit ministers to both the head and the heart, both dimensions are important...

God wants us to know that we are not alone. You have the Holy Spirit to comfort you, 
to teach you the truth, and help you...
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
