Our Bible Verse for Today:
Jesus said, "I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.
Before long, the world will not see me any more, but you will
see me. Because I live you also will live." (Jn. 14:18, 19)

Our lesson for Today:
Sometimes people wish they knew the future so they could prepare for it.
God has chosen not to give us this knowledge. He alone knows what will happen.
But He tells us all we need to know to prepare for the future. When we live by His 
standards, He will not leave us; He will come to us, and show Himself to us...

God knows what will happen, and because He will be with us through it all, We
need not fear. We don't have to know the future to have faith in God; BUT we have 
to have faith in God to be secure about the future...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, thank You for sending the Spirit to assure
me that I am Yours and You are mine...Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
