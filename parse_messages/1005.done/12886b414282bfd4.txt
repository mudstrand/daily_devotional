05/11/2010~~~food for thought~~~HIDDEN MANNA AND A WHITE STONE...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Anyone who is willing to hear should listen to the Spirit and understand what
the Spirit is saying to the churches. Everyone who is victorious will eat of the 
manna that has been hidden away in heaven. And I will give to each one a 
white stone, and on the stone will be engraved a new name that no one knows 
except the one who receives it...(Rev. 3 17)

Our Lesson for Today:
This "manna that has been hidden away in Heaven" suggests the spiritual nourishment
that the faithful believers will receive, As the believers traveled toward the Promised Land.
God provided manna from heaven for their physical nourishment (Ex. 16:13-18).

Jesus has the bread of life (Jn. 6:51), He provides spiritual nourishment that satisfies our 
deepest hunger...

The stones are significant because each will bear the new name of every person who
truly believes in Christ. They are the evidence that a person has been accepted by God
and declared worthy to receive eternal life...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord and Savior, feed me. Assure me of God's 
"Not guilty" verdict as only you can...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
