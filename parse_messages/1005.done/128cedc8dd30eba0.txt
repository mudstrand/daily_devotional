05/25/2010~~~food for thought~~~ARE YOU CERTAIN OF YOUR ETERNAL DESTINY?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain...(Phil. 1:21)

Our Lesson for Today:
Someone once wrote, "Christ is not valued at all unless He is valued
above all." Isn't that what Paul is trying to say to me?

God has given me life so that I might have life's greatest treasure.
All of the world's stocks and bonds can't bring the peace I have in Jesus.
The best house in Greenbush, Mn. looks like some falling-down shack 
compared to my Father's house in heaven...

YES when by faith I have Christ, I have it all. When the Savior dwells in my
heart, the purpose for life is fulfilled. God gives me life, long or short, so that
by His grace I might know Jesus as my only Savior...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, thank You for bringing the Savior into my heart.
Keep Him there always...Amen. 
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
