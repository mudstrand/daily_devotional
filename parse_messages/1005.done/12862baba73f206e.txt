05/04/2010~~~food for thought~~~STOPPING TO VIEW HIS ASCENSION

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Jesus said, "When the Holy Spirit has come upon you, you will receive power 
and will tell people about me everywhere ~ in Jerusalem, throughout Judea, 
in Samaria, and to the ends of The earth." It was not long after He said this that
He was taken up into the sky while they were watching, and He disappeared into 
a cloud. (Acts 1:8, 9)

Our Lesson for Today:
The power from the Holy Spirit is not limited to strength beyond the ordinary. That 
power also involves courage, boldness, confidence, insight, ability, and authority.
The disciples would need all these gifts to fulfill their mission. If you believe in
Jesus Christ as Your Savior, you can also experience the power of the Holy Spirit
in your life...

Remember witnessing is not showing what we can do for God. ~ It is showing and
telling what God has done for us...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, let Your ascension remind me Your
mission is done while mine is only begun...Amen. 
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
