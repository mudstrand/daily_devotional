05/12/2010~~~food for thought~~~WHAT A STAR!!!

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"They will have the same authority I received from My Father,
and I will also give them the morning star! (Rev. 2:28)

Our Lesson for Today:
The morning star is the one who rules the sky with royal splendor. So does Jesus.
He who has won the victory over sin, death, and hell now rules over everything. His
name is above every name; to Him every knee must bow...

When He takes all who believe in Him to heaven, we'll not only see His glorious 
splendor but even share in it. With all other believers we'll shine like a morning star
at His side, not with our own brilliance but with the brilliance derived from Him, the 
true Morning Star...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, be my Morning Star and land me safe
on heaven's shore...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
