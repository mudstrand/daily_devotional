05/28/2010~~~food for thought~~~THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO TO EARN SALVATION,
MERELY ACCEPT WHAT CHRIST HAS ALREADY DONE...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise,
and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things
which are strong...( I Cor. 1:27)

Our Lesson for Today:
Is Christianity against rational thinking? Of course not!!!
Christians do believe in using their minds to weigh the evidence and
make wise choices...

Paul is saying that no amount of human knowledge can replace or bypass 
Christ's work on the cross. If it could, Christ would be accessible only to
the intellectually gifted and well educated and not to ordinary people or to 
children...

In vs. 28-31 Paul goes on to say that the way to receive salvation is so simple
that any person who wants to can understand it. Skill and wisdom do not get
a person into God's kingdom ~ simple faith does...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, in a dying world, fill my heart with
the joy of knowing that to die is gain...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
