05/21/2010 ~~~ food for thought ~~~ ON THE ROAD TO THE HEAVENLY CITY...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
You have come to mount Zion, to the heavenly Jerusalem,
the city of the living God... Heb. 12:22

Our Lesson for Today:
Let's not forget that every Christian is a citizen of the heavenly Jerusalem ~
even now; because Christ rules in our lives, the Holy Spirit is always with
us, and we experience close fellowship with other believers...

Thank God we have a traveling companion, not jus one with whom to share
the sights but one who keeps us on the road. That's our Savior, Jesus Christ
whose death and resurrection make Him the road to Mount Zion...

The full and ultimate rewards and reality of the heavenly Jerusalem are
depicted in Rev. 21... This would make for a good private lesson...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, through the gospel, keep my feet
on the path to Jesus, the road home...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
