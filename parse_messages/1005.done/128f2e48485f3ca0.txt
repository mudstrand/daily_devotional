06/01/2010~~~food for thought~~~PROMISES! PROMISES! PROMISES!

Our Bible Verse for Today:
As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord. (Jos. 24:15)

Our Lesson for Today:
Remember the promises we made at our weddings?
In this month when many marriages occur, we might do well to review those promises.
Even more so, we might want to look at the promises behind successful and enduring marriages...

BUT this text wants us to examine how it has gone with our promise to serve the Lord...

Unless the Lord in His grace reminds us what He has done for us, we can't even begin to serve Him.
When sin bends our spirits in marriage, how can we turn to Him for relief unless we know Him to 
be the Lord who assures us, "Take heart,...your sins are forgiven" (Mt. 9:2)?

Before we can serve the Lord in our marriage, we need to remember what He has done for us...

The secret to serving the Lord is to let Him serve us. When His Word dwells in our homes richly,
His pardon in Christ Jesus will cheer our hearts and empower our lives. Joyful service to Him will
follow. So will remembering and renewing the promises we made to each other on our wedding days...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I long to walk closer to You. Feed me
with Your Word so that I can...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
