05/18/2010~~~food for thought~~~WHAT'S YOUR INHERITANCE?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
God has reserved a priceless inheritance for His children.
It is kept in heaven for you, pure and undefiled, beyond
the reach of change or decay...(I Pet. 1:4)

Our Lesson for Today:
Do you need encouragement? ~~~ Read (I Pet. 1:3-6) here the words of
Peter offer joy and hope in times of trouble, and He bases his confidence
on what God has done for us in Christ Jesus...

According to (vs. 3) we can live with the wonderful expectation of eternal life.
Our hope is not only for the future; eternal life begins when we trust Christ 
and join God's family. No matter what pain or trial we face in this life, we are
assured that it is not our final experience. Eventually we will live with Him...

He wants us to have an inheritance that is truly out of this world...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, raise my eyes to the treasures of heaven,
even as I partially enjoy them already here...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
