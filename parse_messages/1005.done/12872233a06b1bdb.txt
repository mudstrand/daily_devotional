05/07/2010~~~food for thought~~~A TRUE PEACE !!!

Our Bible Verse for Today:
The Lord turn His face toward you and give
you peace...Num. 6:26

Our Lesson for Today:
Peace !!! ~ That's what brought Christ down from His throne of glory to
a cross of shame. Peace !!! ~ That's what Christ has prepared for all people...

No !!! ~ Not peace as the world understands it. Not an end to rocket rattling 
and nuclear threats. Not an end to racial tensions and relatives' bickering.
Not an end to cold-blooded killings in the street or more sanitary murders of
the unborn in the womb...

Such outward peace could very well come IF everyone had God's true peace
in his or her heart... When the Lord promises peace, He means the real thing
Peace with Him...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, give me Your peace for Jesus' sake
and through the Spirit's work...Amen. 
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
