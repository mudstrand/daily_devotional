05/17/2010~~~food for thought~~~WHERE'S YOUR HOPE?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
By His boundless mercy God has given us the privilege of
being born again... (I Pet. 1:3b) 

Our Lesson for Today:
Do you need encouragement? ~~~ Peter's words offer joy and hope in
times of trouble, and he bases his confidence on what God has done
for us in Christ Jesus...

We live with the wonderful expectation of eternal life (vs. 3). Our hope
is not only for the future, eternal life begins when we trust Christ and 
join God's family...

No matter what pain or trial we face in this life, we know that it is not our
final experience. Eventually we will live with Christ forever...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, every day take me back to Christ's
resurrection as proof for all Your promises...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
