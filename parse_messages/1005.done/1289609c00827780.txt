05/14/2010~~~food for thought~~~PERMANENT PILLARS...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
(Rev. 3:12) in capsule form: Him who overcomes I will make a pillar 
in the temple of My God. Never again will he leave it.

Our Lesson for Today:
When Jesus describes believers in heaven as "pillars in the temple of my God,"
there's nothing sad about His words. It's a glorious picture, a comforting thought.
Here on earth we seem to be blown about by every wind that comes along. Some 
days those winds seem like tornadoes against which believers have little protection...

The sins they fall into daily, the temptations they face daily, the struggle with defects 
sin has brought into the world whip them about as if there were no safety...

But there is!!! He who has prepared my salvation promises to protect my soul. He
who brings me peace with God will not let the world rob me of it. He said He will keep
me until His eternal day ~ and He will keep His word. My loving Savior even promises 
that He will make me into a pillar in heaven...

Now that's something to look forward to! BUT only for those who by God's grace know
His Son Jesus as their Savior...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, keep me safe in faith in Jesus as my only 
Savior from sin till I stand in Your heaven...Amen.
In awe of Him ~ Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
