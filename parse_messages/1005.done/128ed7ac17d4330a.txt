05/31/2010~~~food for thought~~~JESUS BOTH GOD AND MAN...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, 
and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only begotten
from the Father, full of grace and truth... (Jn. 1:14)

Our Lesson for Today:
When Jesus was born, God became a man. He was not part man and part God;
He was completely human and completely divine (Col. 2:9). Before Christ came,
people could know God partially. After Christ came, people could know God
fully because He became visible and tangible in Christ...

Christ is the perfect expression of God in human form. The two most common 
errors people make about Jesus are to minimize His humanity or to minimize
His divinity. Remember Jesus is both God and man. 
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
