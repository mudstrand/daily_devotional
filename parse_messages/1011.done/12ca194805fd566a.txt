12/01/2010~~~food for thought~~~MORE GODLY LIFE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will 
disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, 
and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare. 
Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people 
ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives" - 2 Peter 3:10-11 

Our Lesson for Today:
I believe that we all know that the "Day of the Lord", is the day of God's
judgement on the earth. Here it is used in reference to Christ's return.

Christ's second coming will be sudden and terrible for those who do not 
believe in Him. But if we are morally clean and spiritually alert, it won't come 
as a surprise. . .

For other prophetic pictures of the day of the Lord, see Isa. 34:4; Joel 3:15, 16
Mt. 24; Mk. 13; Rev. 6:12-17. Realizing that the earth is going to be burned up, 
we should put our confidence in what is lasting and eternal and not be bound to 
earth and its treasures or pursuits. . .

Do you spend more of your time piling up possessions or striving to develop 
Christlike character?

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord my prayer is that I would develop a Christlike character.
Help me by your Holy Spirit that I might grow in this character each day ...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
