11/27/2010~~~food for thought~~~LIVING BY THE SPIRIT

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of 
the sinful nature. . .(Gal. 5:16)

Our Lesson for Today:
When we are not motivated by love, we become critical of others.
We stop looking for the best in them and see only their faults. the 
result is that the unity of believers is broken. . .

Here is a couple of personal question, "Have you talked about others 
behind their back?" ~ "Have you focused on other's short-coming
instead of their strengths?"

Remind yourself of Jesus' command to love others as you love yourself 
(Mt. 22:39). When you feel critical of someone, make a list of that person's
positive qualities. If there are problems that need to be addressed, it is
better to confront in love than in gossip. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, Help me to be less critical of others 
and more loving, help me to see their positive
qualities. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
