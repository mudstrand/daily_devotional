UNTIMELY DEATH! 


..... BE SURE YOU SCROLL WAY DOWN TO SEE WHAT THIS MESSAGE HOLDS FOR YOU!






DID YOU KNOW 
THESE FACTS? 

I SURE DIDN'T TILL NOW 

Death is certain but the Bible

Speaks about untimely death! 

Make a 
Personal reflection about this... 











Very interesting,

Read until the end... 







It is written in the Bible

(Galatians 6:7): 















'Be not deceived;

God is not mocked: 







For whatsoever

A man sow, 







That shall 
He also reap.' 















Here are some 
Men and women 




Who mocked 
God: 











John Lennon 
(Singer): 












Some years before, during his interview

With an American magazine, he said: 














'Christianity 
Will end, it will disappear. 









I do not have to

Argue about that...





I am certain.













Jesus 
Was ok,

But his subjects

Were too simple,

Today we are more 
Famous than Him' (1966). 











Lennon, after saying that the Beatles were more famous than Jesus Christ, was shot six times. 















Tancredo Neves (President of Brazil ): 







During the Presidential campaign,

He said if he got 500,000 votes from his party,

Not even God would remove him from 
Presidency.. 











Sure, he got the votes, but he got sick a day

Before being made President, then he died. 











Cazuza 
(Bi-sexual Brazilian 
Composer, singer and poet): 







During a show in Canecio ( Rio de Janeiro ), 











While 
Smoking his cigarette,

He puffed out some smoke into the air 
And said: 'God, that's for you.' 











He died at the age of 32

Of LUNG CANCER in a horrible manner.. 











The man who 
Built the Titanic: 











After 
The construction of Titanic,

A reporter asked him how safe the 
Titanic would be 











With 
An ironic tone he said: 







'Not even God

Can sink it.' 











The result:

I think you all know what 
Happened to the Titanic 















Marilyn Monroe 
(Actress) 











She was visited by Billy Graham

During a presentation of a show.. 







He said the Spirit of God

had sent him to preach to her. 







After hearing what the

Preacher had to say, she said: 







'I don't need your Jesus'. 











A week later, 
she was found dead in her apartment. 











Bon Scott 
(Singer) 







The ex-vocalist of the AC/DC..

On one of his 1979 songs, he sang: 







'Don't stop me;

I'm going down all the way,

down the highway to hell'.. 











On the 19th of February 1980,

Bon Scott was found dead..

He had been choked 
by his own vomit. 











Campinas (IN 2005) 







In Campinas , Brazil a group of friends,

drunk, went to pick up a friend.. 







The mother accompanied her to the car

and was so worried about

the drunkenness of her friends

and she said to the daughter, 
holding her hand,

who was already seated in the car: 











'My daughter,

go with God and may He protect you.' 







She responded:

'Only if He (God) travels in the trunk,

'cause inside here...it's already full.' 











Hours later, news came that

they had been involved in a fatal accident. 
Everyone had died. 







the car could not be recognized

as to what type of car it had been,

but, surprisingly, the trunk was intact. 











The police said there was

no way the trunk

could have remained intact.

To their surprise,

inside the trunk was a crate of eggs

None was broken. 











Christine Hewitt

(Jamaican Journalist and entertainer) 
said the 
Bible (Word of God)

was the worst book ever written.. 











In June 2006 
she was found burnt

beyond recognition

in her motor vehicle.. 







Many more important people

have forgotten that there is

no other name that was given

so much authority as the name of Jesus. 











Many have died,

but only Jesus died and rose again,

and he is still alive. 













'Jesus' 









PS: 
If it was a joke,

you would have sent it to everyone.. 
So are you going to 
have courage to send this? 








I have done my part.

Jesus said, 








'If you are 
embarrassed about me, 








I will also be

embarrassed about you

before my Father.' 








You are my 8 in 8 seconds.

I am not breaking this.. No way! 








I'M TOLD THIS WORKS!!!!!

Bishop T.D. Jakes '8 Second Prayer..'

Just repeat this prayer and see how God moves!! 








'Lord, 
I love you and I need you.

Come into my heart, and bless me, 
my family, my home, and my friends,

in Jesus' name. 
Amen.' 








Pass this message to 8 people

{EXCEPT YOU AND ME}.

You will receive a miracle tomorrow.

I hope that you don't ignore and 

let God 
bless you.
