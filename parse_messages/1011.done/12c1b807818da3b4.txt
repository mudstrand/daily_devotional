Our Bible Verse for Today:
". . . But rejoice that you participate in the suffering of Christ. . ." (I Pet. 4:13)

Our Lesson for Today:
Are we participants of Christ's sufferings?
Are we prepared to stamp out our personal ambitions?
Are we prepared for God to destroy our individual decisions
by supernaturally transforming them?

It will mean not knowing why God is taking us that way, because
knowing would make us spiritually proud. ~ We never realize at 
the time what God is putting us through, we go through it more or 
less without understanding. . . ~

Then suddenly we come to a place of enlightenment, and realize
"God has strengthened me and I didn't even know it!"

It is only through our relationship with Jesus Christ that we can understand
what God is after in His dealings with us. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, again I pray that I would be more sensitive to your will,
even though I might not understand all your dealings with me. . . Amen
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
