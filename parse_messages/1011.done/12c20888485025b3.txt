11/26/2010~~~food for thought~~~DO YOU BELIEVE?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Who ever lives and believes in Me will never die.
Do you believe this?" (Jn. 11:26)

Our Lesson for Today:
Jesus has power over life and death as well as power to forgive sins.
This is because He is the creator of life (Jn. 14:6). He who is life can 
surely restore life. . .

whoever believes in Christ has a spiritual life that death cannot conquer 
or diminish in any way. When we realize His power and how wonderful His 
offer to us really is, how can we not commit our lives to Him?

To those of us who believe, what wonderful assurance and certainty we 
have: I will live again, and you will too" (Jn 14:19). . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, thank You, for the most wonderful gift ever given
to all who believe in the Risen Savior, I do believe so I thank 
You. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
