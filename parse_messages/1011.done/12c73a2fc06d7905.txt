11/21/2010~~~food for thought~~~GIVING THANKS FOR ANSWERED PRAYER

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Give thanks in all circumstances (things) (Why ?)
For this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus. . .(I Thess. 5:18)

Our Lesson for Today:
Our joys and our prayers should not fluctuate with our circumstances...

As you know ~ in the last few days I have went through some 
circumstance that can make one wonder ~ what next!

But we need to remember that Paul never suggested that we are to 
give thanks for all that happens to us, but in all things.

So I am taking this opportunity to offer my thanks to all who said a little
prayer for my quick recovery, for in five days, even though having a 
triple by-pass I was able to walk out of the hospital...

Oh my steps were not as quick as before, but I feel your prayers are 
still working because I feel my strength returning more and more
every day...

But let us not forget to give thanks to the One who answers our prayers.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I thank You for answered prayer ~
I ask Your blessings upon all who use this
gift, not only for their own profit but who
use it to intercede in the needs of others...Amen

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
