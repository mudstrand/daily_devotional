Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good. His love endures forever. 
Give thanks to the God of heaven. His love endures forever." - Psalm 136:1,26 

Our Lesson for Today:
If you will notice, repeated throughout this Psalm is the phrase, 
"His love endures forever." 

This psalm may have been a responsive reading, with the congregation saying
these words in unison after each sentence. The repetition made this important 
lesson sink in.

God's love includes aspects of love, kindness, mercy, and faithfulness. We 
never have to worry that God will run out of love because it flows from a well 
that will never run dry. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I thank You for Your endless love, kindness, mercy,
and faithfulness. . .Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
