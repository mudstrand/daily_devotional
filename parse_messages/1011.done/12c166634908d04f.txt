11/04/2010~~~food for thought~~~CALLED TO BE ONE WITH HIM

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Draw near to God and He will Draw near to you. . ." (Jm. 4:8)

Our Lesson for Today: 
When a truth of God is brought home to your soul, never allow it to pass
without acting on it internally in your will, not necessarily in your physical 
life, BUT work it into your life. . .

The weakest saint who transacts business with Jesus Christ is liberated 
the second he acts and God's almighty power is available on his behalf. 
We come up to the truth of God, confess we are wrong, but turn back
again. ~ Then we approach it again and turn back, until we finally learn 
we have no business going back. ~

When we are confronted with such a word of truth from our redeeming 
Lord, we must move directly to transact business with Him. ~ ~ ~
"Come to Me . . ." (Mt. 11:28).

His word [come] means "to act." Yet the last thing we want to do is come. 
But everyone who does come knows that, at that very moment, the super-
natural power of life of God invades him. The dominating power of the world,
the flesh, and the devil is now paralyzed; not by our act, but because our act
has joined us to God and tapped us in to His redemptive power. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, When I hear the word "Come" help me
to draw near in total obedience. . . Amen. 

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather
The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
