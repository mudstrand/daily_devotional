Our Bible Verse for Today:
Now I rejoice in what was suffered for you, and I fill up in my 
flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ's afflictions, for the 
sake of His body, which is the church. . . (Col 1:24) (reread this verse)

Our Lesson for Today:
A Christian worker has to be a sacred "go-between." He/she must be so closely 
identified with his Lord and the reality of His redemption that Christ can continually 
bring His creating life through Him. . .

Now I'm not referring to the strength of one individual's personality being superimposed 
on another, but the real presence of Christ coming through every aspect of the worker's
life. When we preach the historical facts of the life and death of our Lord as they are
conveyed in the New T., our words are made sacred. . .

God uses these words, on the basis of His redemption, to create something in those
who listen which other wise could never have been created. If we simply preach the
effects of redemption in the human life instead of the revealed, divine truth regarding
Jesus Himself, the result is not new birth in those who listen. . .

The result is a refined religious life style, and the Spirit of God cannot witness to it 
because such preaching is in a realm other than His. We must make sure that we 
are living in such harmony with God that as we proclaim His truth He can create in
others those things which He alone can do. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I pray that with Your guidance my witness
would always be in harmony with Your will. . .Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the Father except through me."
John: 14:6
