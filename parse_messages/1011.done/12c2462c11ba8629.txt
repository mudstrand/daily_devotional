11/07/2010~~~food for thought~~~LIVING IN THE MOMENT

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"We know that all things work together for the good 
of those who love God." (Ro. 8:28)

A Lesson to be learned:
With the day following the loss of my mother I sit before my computer wondering:

Am I making the Holy Spirit's work difficult by being vague and unsure, or by trying
to do His work for Him?

I must do the human side of intercession ~ utilizing the circumstances in which I
find myself and the friends and family that surround me. I must keep my conscious
life a sacred place for the Holy Spirit. Then as I lift different ones to God through
prayer, the Holy Spirit intercedes for them. . .

Your intercession can never be mine ~ and my intercession can never be yours, 
". . .but the Spirit Himself makes intercession" in each of our lives (Ro. 8:26).

Without that intercession, the lives of others would be left in poverty and in ruin. 
Let us live in the moment, for today has enough trouble of it's own. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, there are many hurting in the world today,
help me to set aside my own concerns, that I may lift 
up others who have even greater problem. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
