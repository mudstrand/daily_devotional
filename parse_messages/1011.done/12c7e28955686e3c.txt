11/25/2010~~~food for thought~~~HAPPY THANKSGIVING

Our Bible Verse for Today:
We ought to always thank God (II Thess. 1:3a)
Give thanks in all circumstance (I Thess. 5:18a)

Our Lesson for Today:
Yes we have much to be thankful for even during trials because
even then God is trying to teach us something. . .

Yes even when we are living for Christ, we will experience troubles, because 
we are trying to be God's people in a perverse world. Some people say that 
troubles are the result of sin or the lack faith. But Paul teaches that they may
be a part of God's plan for believers...

Our troubles can help us look upward and forward instead of inward (Mk. 13:35, 36;
Phil. 3:13, 14). They can build strong character (Ro. 5:3, 4). And they can
provide opportunities to comfort other who are also struggling (II Cor 1:3-5). . .
Our troubles may be an indication that we are taking a stand for Christ. . .

We occasionally hear of churches going though one struggle after another.
Some years ago an older pastor told me that if you were having trouble it
could be a sign that Satan was trying to discourage you so He could win you
back for himself. He also added that if things were going smoothly it could
be a sign that Satan was happy at were you are at. . . 

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I thank You that no matter what I am going
through I am assured that You are always near, knowing 
my needs. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father accept through Me. (Jn. 14:6)




the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
