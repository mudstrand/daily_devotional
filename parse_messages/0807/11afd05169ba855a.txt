07/07/08 ~~~(food for thought) ~~~ Time spent in the study of the Bible, is time well spent...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Fourteen years later I went up again to Jerusalem, this time
with Barnabas. I took Titus along also...

I went in response to a revelation and set before them the
gospel that I preached among the Gentiles. But I did this
privately to those who seemed to be leaders, for fear that 
I was running or had run my race in vain...(Gal. 2:1, 2) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

God had told Paul through a revelation to confer with the Church
leaders in Jerusalem about the message he was preaching to
the Gentiles, so they would understand and approve of what he
was doing...

The substance of Paul's message to both the Jews and the Gentiles
was that God's salvation is offered to all people regardless of race,
sex, nationality, wealth, social standing, educational level, or anything 
else...

Anyone can be forgiven by trusting in Christ...(see Romans 10:8-13)

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for the free gift of salvation
to all who will believe. Lord I believe help me in my unbelief...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is the One who will lead you home...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
