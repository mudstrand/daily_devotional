BIKER STORY Receives New York Times Best 

A biker is riding by the zoo, when he sees a little girl leaning into the lion's cage. 
Suddenly, the lion grabs her by the cuff of her jacket and tries to pull her inside to 
slaughter her, under the eyes of her screaming parents. The biker jumps off his bike, 
runs to the cage and hits the lion square on the nose with a powerful punch. 
Whimpering from the pain the lion jumps back letting go of the girl, and the biker 
brings her to her terrified parents, who thank him endlessly. 

A New York Times reporter has watched the whole event. The reporter addressing the 
biker says, 'Sir, this was the most gallant and brave thing I saw a man do in my whole life.' 

The biker replies, 'Why, it was nothing, really, the lion was behind bars. I just saw this 
little kid in danger, and acted.' 

The reporter says, 'Well, I'll make sure this won't go unnoticed. I'm a journalist from the 
New York Times, you know, and tomorrow's paper will have this story on the front page... 

"What do you do for a living and what political affiliation do you have?'' 

The biker replies, 'I'm a U.S. Marine and a Republican.' 

The journalist leaves. 

The following morning the biker buys The New York Times to see if it indeed brings news of 
his actions, and reads, on front page:




U.S. MARINE ASSAULTS AFRICAN IMMIGRANT DETAINEE 
AND STEALS HIS LUNCH
