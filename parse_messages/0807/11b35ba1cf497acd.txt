Our Bible Verse for Today:

Does God give His Spirit and work miracles among you
because you observe the law, or because you believe 
what you have heard? (Gal. 3:5) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

The Holy Spirit gives Christians great power to live for God.
BUT some Christians want more than this. They want to live
in a state of perpetual excitement...

The tediousness of their everyday lives leads them to conclude 
that something is wrong spiritually. Often the Holy Spirit's work 
is teaching us to persist, to keep on doing what is right even when
it no longer seems interesting or exciting...

If your Christian life seems ordinary, you may need the Holy Spirit 
to stir you up. Sometimes faith alone seems to easy, but if we allow 
the Holy Spirit to stir us up excitement will return to our lives...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that Your Spirit would
stir in me the excitement I found when I first invited
You into my heart...Amen.

Keep looking up, in an attitude of prayer...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
