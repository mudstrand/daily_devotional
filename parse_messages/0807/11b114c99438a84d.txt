who are no longer alive...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

We who are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners,
know that a man is not justified by observing the law,
but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our
faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith
in Christ and not by observing the law, because by
observing the law no one will be justified...(Gal. 2:15, 16) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

If observing the Jewish laws cannot justify us, why should we still obey
the Ten Commandments and other Old Testament laws?

We know that Paul was not saying the law is bad, because in another
letter he wrote, "The law itself is holy and right and good." (Ro. 7:12)

What Paul is really saying is that the law can never make us acceptable
to God. The law still has an important role to play in the life of a Christian.

The law:
(1) guards us from sin by giving us standards for behavior.
(2) It convicts us of sin, leaving us the opportunity to as for God's forgiveness...
(3) It drives us to trust in the sufficiency of Christ, because we can never keep
the Ten Commandments perfectly...

The law cannot possibly save us. But after we become Christians, it can
guide us to live as God requires...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray for Your guidance 
that I may not sin against you. I pray for added faith
that I may trust wholly in Christ Jesus my Savior...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will give you wisdom...
You are in the prayers of two who care...

Ps. I have to be in Grand Forks with a couple of patience
so I may miss Saturdays devotion...
