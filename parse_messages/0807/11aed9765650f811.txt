07/04/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ We can follow church ritual to the tee
but that will never guarantee us eternal life...

Our Bible verses for Today:

Paul says: "I was one of the most religious Jews of my own age.
and I tried as hard as possible to follow all the old traditions of
my religion...

But then something happened! For it pleased God in His kindness 
to choose me and call me, even before I was born! What undeserved
mercy!

Then He revealed His Son to me so that I could proclaim the Good 
News about Jesus to the Gentiles. When all this happened to me, 
I did not rush out to consult with anyone else. (Gal. I:14-15) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Because God was guiding his ministry, Paul wasn't doing anything
that God hadn't already planned and given him power to do...

Similarly, God appointed Jeremiah to be His spokesman even
before Jeremiah was born (Jer. 1:5)...

God knows each one of us intimately as well, and He chose you
to be His even before you were born (see Ps. 139). He wants you 
to draw close to Him and fulfill the purpose He has for your life...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear heavenly Father, help me to always be alert to Your
will for my life. Help me to be ready at all times to witness
for You...Amen.

Keep looking up, He wants to show you the purpose for your life...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
