Subject: Untimely Deaths









DID YOU KNOW THESE FACTS? 




I SURE DIDNT TILL NOW











Death is certain but the Bible speaks about untimely death!











Make a personal reflection about this.....











Very interesting, read until the end.....







It is written in the Bible (Galatians 6:7):















'Be not deceived; God is not mocked:







for whatsoever a man sow,







that shall he also reap.















Here are some men and women







who mocked God :











John Lennon (Singer):











Some years before, during his interview with an American Magazine, he said:











'Christianity will end, it will disappear.







I do not have to argue about







that. I am certain.











Jesus was ok, but his subjects were too simple, today we are more famous than Him' (1966).











Lennon, after saying that the Beatles were more famous than Jesus Christ, was shot six times.















Tancredo Neves (President of Brazil ):







During the Presidential campaign, he said if he got 500,000 votes from his party, not even God would remove him from Presidency.











Sure he got the votes, but he got sick a day before being made President, then he died.











Cazuza (Bi-sexual Brazilian composer, singer and poet):







During A show in Canecio ( Rio de Janeiro ),











while smoking his cigarette, he puffed out some smoke into the air and said:'God, that's for you.'











He died at the age of 32 of LUNG CANCER in a horrible manner.











The man who built the Titanic











After the construction of Titanic, a reporter asked him how safe the Titanic would be.











With an ironic tone he said:







'Not even God can sink it'











The result: I think you all know what happened to the Titanic















Marilyn Monroe (Actress)











She was visited by Billy Graham during a presentation of a show.







He said the Spirit of God had sent him to preach to her.







After hearing what the Preacher had to say, she said:







'I don't need your Jesus'.











A week later, she was found dead in her apartment











Bon Scott (Singer)







The ex-vocalist of the AC/DC. On one of his 1979 songs he sang:







'Don't stop me; I'm going down all the way, down the highway to hell'.











On the 19th of February 1980, Bon Scott was found dead, he had been choked by his own vomit.











Campinas (IN 2005)







In Campinas , Brazil a group of friends, drunk, went to pick up a friend.....







The mother accompanied her to the car and was so worried about the drunkenness of her friends and she said to the daughter holding her hand, who was already seated in the car:











'My Daughter, Go With God And May He Protect You.'







She responded: 'Only If He (God) Travels In The Trunk, Cause Inside Here.....It's Already Full '











Hours later, news came by that they had been involved in a fatal accident, everyone had died,







the car could not be recognized what type of car it had been, but surprisingly, the trunk was intact.











The police said there was no way the trunk could have remained intact. To their surprise, inside the trunk was a crate of eggs, none was broken











Christine Hewitt (Jamaican Journalist and entertainer) 
said the Bible (Word of God) was the worst book ever written.











In June 2006 she was found burnt beyond recognition in her motor vehicle.







Many more important people have forgotten that there is no other name that was given so much authority as the name of Jesus.











Many have died, but only Jesus died and rose again, and he is still alive.











'Jesus'











PS: If it was a joke, you would have sent it to everyone. 
So are you going to have courage to send this?.







I have done my part, Jesus said







'If you are embarrassed about me,







I will also be embarrassed about you before my father.'







You are my 8 in 8 seconds. I am not breaking this. No way!







I'M TOLD THIS WORKS!!!!! Bishop T.D. Jakes '8 Second Prayer.' Just repeat this prayer and see how God moves!!







'Lord, I love you and I need you, come into my heart, and bless me, my family, my home, and my friends, in Jesus' name. Amen.'







Pass this message to 8 people {EXCEPT YOU AND ME}.You will receive a miracle tomorrow. I Hope that you don't ignore and 
let God bless you.
