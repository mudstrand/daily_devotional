07/17/08~~~(food for thought)~~~Both salvation and sanctification are 
the work of the Holy Spirit...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul says, "Let me ask you this one question: did you receive
the Holy Spirit by keeping the law? Of course not, for the Holy 
Spirit came upon you only after you believed the message you 
heard about Christ...

Have you lost your senses? After starting your Christian lives in
the Spirit, why are you now trying to become perfect by your own
human efforts? (Gal. 3:2, 3) NLT

Our Lesson for Today:

It seems as though some of the believers in Galatia may have 
been in Jerusalem at Pentecost and received the Holy Spirit there.

They knew that they hadn't received the Holy Spirit by obeying the
Jewish laws. Paul stressed that just as they began their Christian 
lives in the power of the Spirit, so they should grow by the Spirit's
power...

The Galatians had taken a step backward when they had decided
to insist on keeping the Jewish laws...

We must realize that we grow spiritually because of God's work in 
us by His Spirit, not by following special rules...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the work of Your Holy Spirit.
I pray that I would continue to grow more sensitive to Your Spirit's
leading and guiding...Amen.

Keep looking up, in an attitude of prayer...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
