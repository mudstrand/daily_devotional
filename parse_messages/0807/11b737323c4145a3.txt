07/30/08 ~~~(food for thought)~~~It is not the outlook but the uplook that counts. (Heb. 12:2a)

Our Bible Verse for Today:

If you belong to Christ then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs
according to the promise...(Gal. 3:29) NIV.

Our Lesson for Today:

The original promise to Abraham was intended for the whole world, not
just for Abraham's descendents (see Gen.12:3)...

All believers participate in this promise and are blessed as children of
Abraham. It is as the little song says that we sang as children.

"Jesus loves the little children all the children of the world, red and
yellow, black, and white, they are precious in His sight ~ Jesus loves
the little children of the world."

We are all his children...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord Jesus, I thank You for Your bounteous love;
a love so great that it encompasses all people...Amen.

Keep looking up, in an attitude of prayer...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
