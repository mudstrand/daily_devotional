07/02/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ If teaching does not match the truth in God's
Word, then it is twisted...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel
other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally
condemned...

As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is 
preaching to you a gospel other than what you have accepted,
let him be eternally condemned! (Gal 1:8, 9) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul strongly denounces anyone who twists the teaching of
the Good News of Jesus Christ. He says that even if an angel
from heaven came preaching some other message, that angel
should be "forever cursed."

If an angel came preaching another message, he would not be
from heaven, no matter how he looked. Paul at another time 
has warned that Satan disguises himself as an angel of light...

Our messages must never change, because the Good News never changes...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to always remain true to the
gospel. Help me to be sensitive to Your Holy Spirits leading.
For I ask it in Jesus Name...Amen.

Keep looking up, and He will guide you in the way you shall go...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
