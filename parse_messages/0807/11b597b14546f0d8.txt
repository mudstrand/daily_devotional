We are never to young or to old to let God's light shine...

CHURCH HID IN THE WEEDS

Just two little boys
walking down a dusty lane.....
They came upon this old white house...
with broken window panes.

The paint was faded, the shine was gone,
the grass had grown so high....
still they made their little feet
go see what was inside.

They opened up the squeaky door
and then it came to light....
This must have been an old church house...
once upon a time.

Dirty, dusty wooden pews...
a pulpit that still stood...
A Bible laid upon it....
though the pages weren't too good.

An offering plate and song books too...
were lying on the floor.
They must have left this old church fast...
the day they closed these doors.

And over in the corner...
a piano was still there.
it must have played a pretty tune..
but I guess nobody cared.

So little Bill looked up at Tommy..
and Tommy looked at Bill...
Why don't we clean this old church up,
and get these old pews filled?"

They took a rag and wiped the dust
to try and make things shine,
And then they took the offering plate
and put in it their last dime.

They took a broom and swept the floor
and picked up broken glass.
They got it all so nice and neat
and then they mowed the grass.

They lifted up the old church sign
and stood it by a tree.
Right down by that old dirt road
where everyone could see.

They ran back home, to find Daddy gone
but their Momma was inside,
Just to find her hurt again,
where Daddy had made her cry.

"Don't cry Momma, wipe those tears,"
Little Bill and Tommy smiled.
"Cause! We have a big surprise for you,
just down the road a mile."

Hand in hand they tugged at her,
until they made her run.
"What is it Bill, Oh Tommy,
just what have you two kids done?"

And then they came upon the house,
once hidden by the weeds.
and there it stood a country church,
just like it used to be.

"But what is it, Mother? What's with your tears?
We thought this would bring you joy."
"Yes, but hush kids now and listen close,
my two sweet precious boys."

They both got quiet and stood real still,
for the words they heard so true.
was Daddy praying in the church,
with his head bowed on the pew.

"Forgive me Lord! Forgive me Lord !
though I' m not worthy of Your love,
shine down on this sinner man
sweet Salvation from above."

"For I've been out in the world, You know..
living my life all wrong,
until I came upon this church;
the place where I belong."

"I never noticed it before
all those times I passed it up.
I guess I wasn't looking, Lord
or maybe I was drunk."

"Bless oh Lord, yes, bless oh Lord
the one who made me see.
this little church that used to hide
behind all those tall weeds."

And then he raised his head and stood
with his hands high in the air,
to find two dirty, tear-faced boys
with Momma standing there.

They ran up to him, hugged him tight
as their tears fell on the floor.
"Don't worry kids, I'm not the Dad,
the one you've known before."

Things are different for us now
so keep on those pretty smiles,
and let's go gather people in
to walk down these church aisles."

Then Bill looked up at Tommy,
and Tommy looked at Bill.
"Come on brother, let's get to work
to get these old pews filled."

"For we need no special blessing

for cleaning up this church.
'Cause, God gave us back our Daddy,
and that's more than gold is worth."

Sunday morning, pews all filled,
and smiles on every face.
Especially two little country boys,
the ones who found this place.

Though it was hid back in the weeds
and so far out of sight,
Nothing's ever hard to find
if you're walking toward God's light.
