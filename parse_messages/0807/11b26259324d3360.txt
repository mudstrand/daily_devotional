07/22/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ We have been crucified with Christ...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives 
in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, 
who loved me and gave Himself for me...(Gal. 2:20) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

How have we been crucified with Christ? WELL!!! Legally, God looks at 
us as if we had died with Christ. Because our sins died with Him, we are
no longer condemned (Col 2:13-15)...

Relationally we have become one with Christ, and His experiences are ours.
Our Christian life began when, in unity with Him, we died to our old life
(Ro. 6:5-11). In our daily life, we must regularly crucify sinful desires that
keep us from following Christ...

This, too, is a kind of dying with in Him (Lk. 9:23-25). Yet the focus of 
Christianity is not, dying but on living...

Because we have been crucified with Christ, we have also been raised with 
Him (Ro. 6:5). We have been reconciled to God...Amen.

Our Prayer for Today:
I thank You Lord Jesus for Your great and awesome love
that You would take my place on the cross, so that I might
have eternal life. Bless all my e-mail friends today...Amen.

Keep looking up, for added strength...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
