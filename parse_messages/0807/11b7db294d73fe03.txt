08/01/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ Feed your faith and your doubts will 
starve to death...(Heb.10:39)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Because you are sons, God sent the spirit of His Son into
our hearts, the Spirit who calls out "Abba, Father"

So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a
son, God has made you also an heir...(Gal. 4:6, 7) NIV.

Our Lesson for Today:

Under Roman law, an adopted child was guaranteed all
legal rights to his father's property, even if he was formerly 
a slave. He was not a second-class son, He was equal to 
all other sons, biological or adopted, in his father's family.

As adopted children of God we share with Jesus all rights 
to God's resources. As God's heirs, we can claim what He
has provided for us ~ our full identity as His children...
(see Ro. 8:15-17)

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the provisions You
have made for me. I pray that as a son I would become 
more and more Christ-like...Amen.

Keep looking up, with this prayer in mind...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
