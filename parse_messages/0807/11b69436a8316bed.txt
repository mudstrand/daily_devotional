07/28/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ A minute of thought is worth more than
an hour of talk...(Ps. 141:3).

Our Bible Verses for Today:

So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we
might be justified by faith...

Now that faith has come, we are no longer under the
supervision of the law...(Gal. 3:24, 25) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

The picture of the law as being a guardian is similar to a
teacher giving a young child supervision. The law teaches 
us the need for salvation. God's grace gives us that salvation...

The Old Testament still applies today. In it, God reveals His nature, 
His will for humanity, His moral laws, and His guidelines for living.
But we cannot be saved by keeping the law, we must trust in Christ...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You that Your Word is the same
yesterday ~ today ~ and forever. I thank You that it shows me 
my need for a Savior. Help me to continue to be sensitive to Your
truth...Amen.

Keep looking up, in an attitude of prayer...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
