08/31/09~~~food for thought~~~What Jesus has done for us is more than enough!

Our Bible Verse for Today:
See what God has done! (Num. 23:23b)

Our Lesson for Today:
In 1844, the inventor Samuel Morse sent a message by telegraph
from Baltimore to Washington. His message contained only four
words: "What hath God wrought!" (KJV.)

That successful demonstration sold his invention, and news-gathering 
agencies turned to its use...

Today its satellite television and cellular phones, now we have to go
to a museum to learn about Morse's invention...

There is no replacement for the telegraph God uses to transmit His
message to us. Just as to the generations before and after us, God
speaks through His Word...

Oh yes, the methods used to carry His Word may change. In the future,
who knows what means might pop up? And we'll thank God even as we
try to harness those means to get His Word out...

But the message will still be the same. It'll still be, "See what God has done."

It will point at the sinner with the chilling reminder of Gods law ~ what man 
has done can only doom him...

Then it will point to God with the saving revelation of God's gospel ~ what 
Jesus has done is more than enough to save the sinner...

"See what God has done in His enduring love to ready that sinner for heaven."

For that timeless message there can never be a replacement...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, through Your Word let me hear You telling
me what You have done to save me...Amen.
