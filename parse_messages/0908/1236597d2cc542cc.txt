08/29/09~~~food for thought~~~If you have become disconnect from Jesus
reconnect today, a sin may be waiting to strike
at any moment...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Jesus Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree...
By His wounds you have been healed...(I Pet. 2:24)

Our Lesson for Today:
When the church's roof was redone, the contractor discovered 
that the lightning rods hadn't been properly installed. The rods
stood there with heavy wires running down, but they were not attached 
to anything on the lawn below. So the ground could not absorb
the charge which never reached it...

The lightning of God's just anger over sin had to strike. That's what 
justice means. If His anger were to hit sinners, they'd be fried to a 
crisp in the fires of hell...

So God in His love provided a lightning rod system for us, He
deflected the punishment for sin from us to Jesus...

How foolish for unbelievers to think they can ground God's
lightning strikes for sin! How blessed are those who are connected
by faith's wire to Jesus!

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, Keep me connected to Jesus so that I
can stand safely in heaven before You...Amen.
