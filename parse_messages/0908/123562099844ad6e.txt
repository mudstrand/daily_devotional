08/26/09~~~food for thought~~~There can be no substitution for Christ...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
If righteousness could be gained through the law,
Christ died for nothing! (Gal. 2:21)

Our Lesson for Today:
People today seem to be continually looking for a substitution for one 
thing or another, even when it comes to their salvation...

One of Satan's most effective attacks against Christianity is deceiving
people into thinking they can substitute for Christ's work of salvation...

When people look to their own efforts to satisfy their hunger for heaven, 
Satan has them in his grasp and heads for hell...

Jesus said of sin's payment on the cross, "It is finished."

The sinner mistakenly says, "I must add something with my own works."

Jesus says to the penitent sinner. "Go in peace."

The sinner foolishly says, "How can I have peace when I don't know
whether my works have done enough to save me?"

Jesus says to the dying believer, "Today you'll be with Me in heaven."

The sinner anxiously worries, "Are my efforts sufficient to help hold open
heaven's door?"

This is why Paul insists. "If I try to substitute my own works fully or in part for
Christ's completed work of Salvation, then Christ died for nothing."

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, preserve me from such fatal false thinking.
Cement my faith on Jesus' work alone...Amen.
