08/17/09~~~food for thought~~~How much more does God have to do
to prove He loves us???

Our Bible Verse for Today:
From the time the earth was created, people have seen the
earth and sky and all that God made. They can clearly see 
His invisible qualities ~ His eternal power and divine nature.
So they have no excuse whatsoever for not knowing God...(Ro. 1:20)

Our Lesson for Today:
What kind of God does nature reveal???

Nature shows us a God of might, intelligence, and intricate detail;
a God of order and beauty; a God who controls powerful forces...

That is general revelation. Through special revelation (the Bible and
the coming of Jesus), we learn about God's love and forgiveness and
the promise of eternal life...

But knowing God exists is not enough. People must learn that God is
loving and that He sent His Son to demonstrate His love for us (5:8).

People must be shown how to accept God's forgiveness of their sins. 
(Ro. 10:14, 15)

Yes God has graciously given us many sources that we might come to
believe in Him...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, create within me a deep desire to 
learn more about You. Let this be my one desire
and continual prayer ~ the life and the love of You
living in my heart...Amen.
