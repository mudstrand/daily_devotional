08/24/09~~~food for thought~~~What will my eternal inheritance be?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Surely I have a delightful inheritance...(Ps. 16:6)

Our Lesson for Today:
A pastor stopped to visit a wealthy man in the area. He proudly said to 
the pastor, "All this is mine," as he was giving the pastor a tour of his farm. 
Everything as far as the eye could see was his...

The pastor quietly asked, "Is Jesus yours."

Good question, Is Jesus mine? Can I say with the psalmist, "Surely I 
have a delightful inheritance"?

Nothing in this world can top the treasures God offers me in the Savor.
When the dollars and cents are lined up against the precious blood of 
Jesus that paid for my sins, how short they seem...

When the buildings and holdings of this life are placed on the scales,
how light they weigh in contrast to the pardon and peace Christ brings
me with the heavenly Father...

The question still remains, "Is Jesus mine?" That little word mine is
so important. What good is an inheritance if our name isn't on it?
Or what good is an inheritance if we do not claim it?

Thank God if He has opened the hand of faith for you to claim the
riches Jesus has prepared for you. Pray each day that God would
open your hand of faith and wrap it around such a delightful inheritance...

Prayer Suggestion:
Thank you Lord, for the gift of Jesus and all He brings.
Help me keep my faith in Him always...Amen.
