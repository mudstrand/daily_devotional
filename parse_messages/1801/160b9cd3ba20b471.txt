VERSE FOR TODAY:

_"Be angry and do not sin," Do not let the sun go_

_down on your wrath, nor give place to the devil._

(Eph. 4:26, 27)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

The Bible doesn't tell us we shouldn't feel anger, BUT IT

points out that it is important to handle our anger properly.

If we keep it inside, it can cause us to become bitter and

destroy us from within. Paul says to deal with our anger

immediately, in a way that builds relationships rather than

destroying them. Don't let the day end before you begin to

work on mending your relationship.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

O Lord, please forgive me, I am often guilty of bottling up

anger within. Help me to properly handle my anger toward

those who have ruffled my feathers so to speak. Help me

build a more compassionate spirit. . . Amen.
