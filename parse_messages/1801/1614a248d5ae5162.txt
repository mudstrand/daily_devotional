VERSE FOR TODAY:

_"I pray that your love for each other will overflow more _

_and more, and that you will keep growing in your knowledge_

_ and __understanding." _(Phil. 1:9)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

Often the best way to influence someone is to pray for them.

Paul's prayer for the Philippians was that they would be unified

in love. Their love was to result in a greater knowledge of Christ

and s deeper moral discernment.. As we grow in Christ's love, our

heart and mind must grow together.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Heavenly Father, I have to confess that it is easy to

fall into the trap of praying only for family needs. I pray

that you would enlighten me in the needs of others

especially the less fortunate. I pray now for our ministers,

missionaries, and evangelists. I pray that our country's

leaders would grow in a deeper moral discernment. . . Amen.
