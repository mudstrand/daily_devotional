VERSE FOR TODAY:

_"The promise for honoring your father and mother. you will live a
long _

_life, full of blessings." _(Eph. 6:3)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

Obeying our parents is our main task when we are young, but honoring

should continue even beyond their death. One way to honor our parents

is to provide for them in times of financial need or when they are
unable

to care for themselves.One of the best ways to honor them is to pass
on

their godly values to our children. (Question) Are you truly living
in a

way that brings honor to your parents?

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Heavenly Father, help me by the power of Your Holy Spirit to
honor

my parents as Christ honored You by fulfilling Your will while He
walked

this earth, even to the point of suffering for the sins of the world.
Help me

to mirror the godly values of my parents to my children.. . Amen.
