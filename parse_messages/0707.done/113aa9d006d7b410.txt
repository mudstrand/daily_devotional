In our busyness we often forget to tell our friends
how much they mean to us...

for my friends 

Subject: Let's see if you read your mail 






What would you do if your best friend died tomorrow and you never got to tell them how you felt? 





So, I just wanted to say, even if I never talk to you again in my life, 
you are special to me and you have made a difference in my life. 







I look up to you, respect you, and truly cherish you. 









Send this to all your friends, no matter how often you talk, or how 
close you are, and send it to the person who sent it to you. 





Let old friends know you haven't forgotten them, 
and tell new friends 
you never will. 







Remember, everyone needs a friend, someday you might feel like you have 
NO FRIENDS at all, just remember this e-mail and take comfort in knowing somebody out there cares about you and always will. 





In times of trouble, 
In times of need, 
If you are feeling SAD, 







You can count on me. 
I will gi ve you a wink, 







Until you smile, 







give you a hug, 







And stand by your side. 




I'll be there for you till the end, I'll always and forever, be your friend! 





INSTANTLY WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS, 
YOU MUST SEND IT TO AT LEAST 10 FRIENDS, 
INCLUDING THE PERSON WHO SENT IT TO YOU!
