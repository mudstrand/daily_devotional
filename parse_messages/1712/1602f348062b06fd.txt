VERSE FOR TODAY:

_"Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners,_

_but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household _

_of God. _(Eph. 2:19)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

Here is the first thought--the second word in our verse today

is THEREFORE. So what is the THEREFORE there-for? Well it should

draw us back to yesterdays verse. In verse 18 we are told that

"THROUGH Jesus we have access to the Father." So we now see

that because of this act we are members of the household of

God, which means we will receive the gift of eternal life.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

I thank You Lord Jesus for the gift You made available to Me

by Your love, there is no way to express this wonderful gift

accept by remaining faithful and trusting in You. . . Amen.
