VERSE FOR TODAY:

_"Behold the Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son and_

_shall call His name Immanuel." _(God with us) (Isa. 7:14)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

There was a gift for each of us left under the TREE OF LIFE 2,000
years

ago by Him whose birthday we are celebrating today. The gift was

not withheld from anyone. Some have left the gifts unclaimed. Some

have accepted the gift and carry it around, but have failed to remove

the wrappings and look inside to discover the hidden splendor. The

packages are all alike: in each is a scroll on which is written,

_"All that the Father hath is thine. Take and live." _

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

O Lord of grace and mercy, I thank you for the greatest gift

I have ever received, the gift of eternal life which is available

to all who will confess that they are a sinner, and ask Jesus

into their heart. . . Amen.
