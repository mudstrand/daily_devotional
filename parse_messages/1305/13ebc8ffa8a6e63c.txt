===================================================================
Body (clean, unformatted):
===================================================================
All have sinned and fall short of God's gracious standard. (Ro. 3:23)



Food for thought



Agreed-some sins seem bigger than others because their obvious consequences

Are much more serious. Murder for example seems to us to be worse than
hatred,

And adultery seems worse than pride. BUT this does not mean that because we
only

Commit "little" sins we deserve eternal life. ALL SINS makes us sinners,
AND ALL SINS

Cut us off from our holy God. . .



So all sins lead to death-(because they disqualify us from living with God)
regardless

Of how great or small they seem. . . SO don't minimize "little" sins or
overrate "big"

Sins. They all separate us from God, But they all can be forgiven! ! !



Have a Blessed Lord's Day!



We are not living in (Glenwood, Mn.)

I have started Sunday Morning Services here.

We live in an apt. which has about 48 apts.

We love it here it is like we been here forever.

We are on the 3rd floor and our livingroom window

Faces the lake, which is only about 8 or 10 blocks away.
