Today's Verse: Ps. 138:8



The Lord will work out his plans for my life- for your faithful love,

O Lord, endures forever. Don't abandon me, for you made me.



Food for thought:

I believe every person dreams and makes plans for the future.

Then they work hard to make their dreams and plans come true.



But to make the most of life, we need to include God's plan in

Our plans. He alone knows what is best for us; He alone can

Fulfill His purpose for us. . .



As you make plans and dream dreams-talk with God about it.



We've been asked how we are doing-well we love it here-but I'm

Waiting for the weather to straighten up so I can go fishing. Lake

Minnewaska is only 8 or 10 blocks away. Every time I look out the 

Living-room window I see the lake.



It's kind of like putting a bottle of booze in front of an alcoholic ha-ha
