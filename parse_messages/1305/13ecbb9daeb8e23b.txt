Today's Verse: Col. 2:1

(Paul's prayer for his people)

"I want you to know how much I have agonized for you and for the church at 

Laodicea, and for many other believers who have never met me personally."



Today's Lesson:

Something we may give very little thought to is: "Prayer is sacrifice."

Our prayer has its worth alone from being rooted in the sacrifice of

Jesus Christ. As He gave up everything in His prayer: "Thy will be done,"

Our posture and disposition must be the offering up of everything to

God in His service.

Need we wonder at the lack of power in our prayer where there is

So much reluctance to make the needful sacrifice in waiting upon

God?



Today's Prayer:

Dear Lord Jesus: help us to learn that the secret of powerful prayer

Is sacrifice-sacrifice of ease-of time-and of self. . . Amen.
