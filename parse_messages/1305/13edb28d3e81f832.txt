Today's Verse: Ro. 12:3b

Don't think you are better than you really are. Be honest in your evaluation
of yourselves,

measuring yourselves by the faith God has given us. . .



Today's thought:

Healthy self-esteem is important because some of us think too little of
ourselves; on the other hand.

Some of us over-estimate ourselves-the key to an honest and accurate
self-evaluation is knowing

the basis of our self-worth-our identity in Christ. . .



Apart from Him, we aren't capable of very much by eternal standards; in Him,
we are valuable and 

capable of worthy service. . .



Evaluating ourselves by the worldly standards of success and achievements
can cause us to think too

much about our worth in the eyes of others and so miss our true value in
God's eyes. . .
