Today's Scripture: Ro 10:9-10

If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart
that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and
it is by confessing with your mouth that you are saved



Today's Lesson:

Have you ever been asked-"How do I become a Christian?" These verse give you
a beautiful answer.

Salvation is as close as your lips and your heart. It seems as though many
people think it must be a 

Complicated proccess, but it is not. 

If we believe in our heart, and say with our mouth that Christ is the risen
Lord. We will be saved.



As we grow-A Christian should be-

A mind through which Christ thinks-

A voice through which Christ speaks-

A heart through which Christ loves-

A hand through which Christ helps. . .



Have a blessed week end! ! !



I will be away from the computor for five days
