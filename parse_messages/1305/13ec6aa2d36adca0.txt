Verse for Today:



Our Father who art in Heaven. Lk. 11:2



Food for Thought:

How simple, and how beautiful, this invocation is which Christ puts upon our
lips!

And yet how inconceivably rich these words are in their meaning. How full of
the 

love and blessing they contain. . .

Just think what a book could be written of all the memories that there are
on 

earth of wise and loving fathers. Just think of what this world owes to the
fathers who

have made their children strong and happy in giving their lives to seek the
welfare 

of their fellowmen. And then think how all this is but a shadow-a shadow of
beauty

beyond compare, but still but a shadow-of what the Father in heaven is to
His

children on earth. . .

What a gift Christ bestowed upon us when He gave us the right to
say: "Father!"

"The Father of Christ!" "Our Father!" "My Father!" What a privilege is ours
when

we bow in worship to know that the our heavenly Father comes near to us
where we 

are upon the earth. What a wonderful gift! ! !
