Today's Verse: Psalms 4:7-8 (NLT)

7 You have given me greater joy than those who have abundant harvests of
grain and new wine

8 In peace I will lie down and sleep, for you alone, O Lord, will keep me
safe. 



Today's Thoughts:

Two kinds of joy are contrasted here-inward joy that come from knowing and
trusting God-

and happiness that comes as a result of pleasant circumstances. . .



Inward joy is steady as long as we trust God, happiness is unpredictable.
Inward joy defeats

discouragement; happiness covers it up-Inward joy is lasting; happiness is
temporary. . .



The choice is yours-neither is forced upon us. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord my choice is simple I choose knowing and trusting You so that

I may have the inward lasting Joy that comes from You. . . Amen.
