Today's Verses: Psalms 6:6-10 (NLT)

I am worn out from sobbing. All night I flood my bed with weeping,
drenching it with my tears.

7 My vision is blurred by grief; my eyes are worn out because of all my
enemies. 
8 Go away, all you who do evil, for the Lord has heard my weeping.

9 The Lord has heard my plea; the Lord will answer my prayer.

10 May all my enemies be disgraced and terrified. May they suddenly turn
back in shame. 



Today's Thoughts:

Pouring out his heart with tears, David was completely honest with God-

We can be honest with God even when we are filled with anger or despair

because God knows us thoroughly and wants the very best for us.

Anger may result in rash outward acts or turning inward in depression.



BUT if we trust in our all-powerful God-we don't have to be victims of

circumstances or be weighed down by the guilt of sin. . .



Be honest with God-and He will help you turn your attention from yourself

to Him and His mercy. . . 



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me of my sins so that I may not be

weighed down with guilt. Help me see to turn my attention on

You and realize Your grace and mercy. . . Amen.
