Today's Verse: Psalms 3:5 (NLT)

5 I lay down and slept, yet I woke up in safety, for the Lord was watching
over me. 



Today's Thoughts:

Sleep does not come easily during a crises. David could have had many
sleepless nights when his son 

Absalom rebelled and gathered together an army to kill David. But he slept
peacefully, even during

the rebellion. . .



What made the difference? ? ? David cried out to the Lord-and the Lord
heard him.

The assurance of answered prayer bring peace. It is easier to sleep well
when we have

full assurance that God is in control of circumstances. . .



If you are lying awake at night worrying about circumstances you can't
change-pour out

your heart to God, and thank Him that He is in control-Then sleep will come.
. .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, You know that I have often worried needlessly when You are very
capable

of taking care of any circumstance that comes my way. Forgive me for my
little faith. . . Amen.
