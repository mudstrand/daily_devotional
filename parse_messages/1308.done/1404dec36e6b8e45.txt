Today's Verses: Psalms 4:5-6 (NLT)

Offer sacrifices in the right spirit, and trust the Lord. 
6 Many people say, "Who will show us better times?" 

Let your face smile on us, Lord. 



Today's Thoughts:

As we know worship in David's day included animal sacrifices by the priests
in the Tabernacle.

The animal's blood covered the sins of the one who offered the animals.
There were specific 

rules for offering sacrifices, but more important to God than ceremony was
the attitude or

submission and obedience-as we see in (I Sam. 15:22, 23). . .



Today a "proper sacrifice," one that is pleasing to God, is still the same,
He wants our obedience

and our praise before our gifts as seen in-(Heb. 13:15). . .



SO let us remember to offer God our sacrifice of total obedience and
heartfelt praise. . . 



Today's Prayer suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that I would be sensitive to Your Spirit's
guidance

so that I would be submissive to Your will and that my praises would be
pleasing

To You, I pray this in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. . .
Amen.
