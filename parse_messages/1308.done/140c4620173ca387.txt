Today's Verse's: Psalms 8:1-2 (NLT)

1 O Lord, our Lord, your majestic name fills the earth! Your glory is higher
than the heavens.

2 You have taught children and infants to tell of your strength, silencing
your enemies and all who oppose you. 



Today's Thoughts:

Have you noticed how easy it is for children to trust and praise God without
reservations?

Have you also notice that, as we grow older, many of us find it more and
more difficult to do so.



So what are we to do? Well what we need to do is ask God to give us a
childlike faith removing 

any and all barriers-so that we might have a closer walk with Him. . .
Simple yes, 

but oh how often we neglect to do just that, if we did it would eliminate oh
so many worries.



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord remove the barriers that stand in the way that I might 

praise You as I should so that I might have a closer walk with You. . .Amen
