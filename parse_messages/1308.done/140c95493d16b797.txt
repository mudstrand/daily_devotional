Today's Verse: Psalms 8:3-5 (NLT)

When I look at the night sky and see the work of your fingers- the moon and
the stars you set in place-

4 what are people that you should think about them, mere mortals that you
should care for them? 

5 Yet you made them only a little lower than God and crowned them with glory
and honor. 



Today's Thoughts:

In order to respect God's Majesty, we must compare ourselves to His
greatness.

When we look at all creation, we often feel small by comparison. Now to feel
small 

Is a healthy way to get back to reality, but God does not want us to dwell
on our

smallness. . .



Remember this, humility means proper respect for God, not self-depreciation.

The next time you question your worth as a person, remember that God

considers you highly valuable. We have great worth because we bear the 

stamp of the Creator.



Remember God considered us so valuable that He sacrificed His own Son

so that the debt for our sins was paid in full. . . 



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, I often wonder how You can be concerned for me when I 

constantly disappoint you. This is a love that I cannot begin to phantom.

All I can do is thank You once again, and beg Your forgiveness. . . Amen.

Ps. 7:17 I will thank the Lord because He is just;

I will sing praises to the name of the Lord Most High.
