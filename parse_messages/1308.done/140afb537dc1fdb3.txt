Today's Verses: Psalms 7:1-6 (NLT)

1 I come to you for protection, O Lord my God. Save me from my
persecutors-rescue me!

2 If You don't, they will maul me like a lion, tearing me to pieces with no
one to rescue me.

3 O Lord my God, if I have done wrong or am guilty of injustice,

4 If I have betrayed a friend or plundered my enemy without cause,

5 Then let my enemies capture me. Let them trample me into the ground and
drag my honor in the dust. 
6 Arise, O Lord, in anger! Stand up against the fury of my enemies! Wake up,
my God, and bring justice! 



Today's Thoughts:

Have you ever been falsely accused or so badly hurt that you wanted revenge?

David wrote this Psalm in response to the slanderous accusations of those
who

claimed he was trying to kill Saul and seize the throne (I Sam. 24:9-11). 



Instead of taking things into his own hands and striking back, David cried
out to

God for justice. The proper response to slander is prayer, not
revenge-because

God says: "I will take revenge-I will repay those who deserve it" (Ro.
12:19; Heb. 10:30)



Instead of striking back ask God to take your case-to bring justice-and
restore your reputation. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, help me bridle my tongue and instil in me pure thoughts

when something slanderous has been said about me. Help me to have

a Christ-like attitude. . . Amen.
