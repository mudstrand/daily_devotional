Today's Verse: Psalms 7:17 (NLT)

I will thank the Lord because he is just; I will sing praise to the name of
the Lord Most High. 



Today's Thoughts

During times of great evil and injustice, David was grateful that God is
just and faithful-

When we wonder if anyone is honest and fair, we can be assured that God will
continue

to bring justice and fairness when we involve Him in our activities-



If you ever feel that you are being treat unfairly, ask the One who is
always fair and just

to be with you. Then thank Him for His presence. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You, that You are fair and just and that

You are a loving and forgiving God. I thank You for being close at hand

and are just a prayer away. . . Amen.
