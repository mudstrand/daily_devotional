Our Verse for Today:

We are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus 
to do good works, which God prepared in advance 
for us to...(Eph. 2:10) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

"We are God's workmanship" another translation says ~
"We are God's masterpiece."

It is easy for humans to be proud of what they have accomplished
and we have accomplished some extraordinary things ~ BUT ~ let
us never forget that our salvation is only something God can do...
It is His powerful, creative work in us. 

Another thought ~ IF ~ God considers us his masterpiece, how dare 
we treat ourselves ~ OR ~ others for that matter with disrespect or as 
inferior work...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for thumbing my noses at 
others. Help me to remember, every human being is a creation
of Yours. Help me to remember that if someone does something
I don't agree with, that I pray for them, and examine myselves so 
that I am not at throne in someone else's side...Amen.

Keep looking up, Seek Godly wisdom from above...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor AL & Marcie Sather
