~LITTLE OLD LADY~ 




� 
There was a little old lady, who every morning. stepped onto her front porch, raised her arms to the sky, and shouted: 'PRAISE THE LORD!' �

One day an atheist moved into the house next door. �
He became irritated at the little old la dy. 
Every morning he'd step onto his front porch after her and yell: 'THERE IS NO LORD!' 

Time passed with the two of them carrying on this �
way every day. 

One morning, in the middle of winter, the little old lady stepped onto her front porch and shouted: 'PRAISE THE LORD! Please Lord, I have no food and I am starving, provide for me, oh Lord! �
</ FONT>
The next morning she s tepped out onto her porch and there were two huge bags of groceries sitting there �

'PRAISE THE LORD!' she cried out. 'HE HAS PROVIDED GROCERIES FOR ME!' 

The atheist neighbor jumped out of the hedges �
and shouted: 
'THERE IS NO LORD; I BOUGHT THOSE GROCERIES!!' 

The little old lady threw her arms into the air and shouted: 'PRAISE THE LORD! 
HE HAS PROVIDED ME WITH GROCERIES AND MADE THE DEVIL PAY FOR THEM! ' � 



SMILE AND PASS THIS ON.
