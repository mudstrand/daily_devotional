10/27/08~~~(food for thought)~~~We serve a God of love...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Because of His great love for us, God who is rich in mercy,

made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions ~
it is by grace you have been saved...(Eph. 2:4, 5) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

In verses 1-3 Paul wrote about our old sinful nature. Here Paul emphasizes
that we do not need to live any longer under sin's power. The penalty of sin 
and its power over us were miraculously destroyed by Christ on the cross...

Through faith in Christ we stand acquitted, or not guilty, before God (Ro. 3:21, 22).
God does not take us out of the world or make us robots ~ we will still feel like 
sinning, and sometimes we will sin. The difference is that before we became
Christians, we were dead in sin and were slaves to our sinful nature...

BUT now we are alive with Christ (see Gal. 2:20)...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your love and mercy.
I thank You for providing a way onto salvation through Your
Son, or Lord Jesus Christ. I pray for a sensitive heart that I
may be lead by Your Holy Spirit...Amen.

Keep looking up, He wants to guide us in 
the way of eternal life...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
