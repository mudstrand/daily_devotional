10/31/08~~~(food for thought)~~~Let us stop each day a remember how great a gift we 
have been given through the shed blood of Christ..

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Therefore, remember that formality you who are Gentiles by birth
and called "uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "the
circumcision" (that done in the body by the hands of men) ~

remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded
from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise,
without hope and without God in the world...

But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought 
near through the blood of Christ...(Eph. 2:11-13) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Jews and Gentiles alike could be guilty of spiritual pride ~ Jews for thinking
their faith and traditions elevated them above everyone else. Gentiles for 
trusting in their achievements, power, or position...

Spiritual pride blinds us to our own faults and magnifies the faults of others,
Be careful not to become proud of your salvation. Instead, humbly thank God
for what He has done, and encourage others who might be struggling in
their faith...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I do thank You for the wonderful gift of 
salvation that is mine through faith in the shed blood of Christ.
Forgive me for any spiritual pride I have shown in the past,
remembering that salvation is a gift, not something I have achieved
by any works of my own...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is a mighty fortress...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
