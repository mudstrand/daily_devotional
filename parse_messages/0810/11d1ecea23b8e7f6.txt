Our Bible Verses for Today:

And His incomparably great power is like the working of His 
mighty strength,

which He exerted in Christ when He raised Him from the dead
and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly realms, (Eph. 1:19, 20) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

The world fears the power of the atom, yet we belong to
the God of the universe, who not only created that atomic
power but also raised Jesus Christ from the dead...

God's incomparably great power is available to help us.
There is nothing to difficult for Him...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your grace and 
mercy which is new every morning. I pray that You would 
give me greater faith each day, help me to become more
Christ-like each and every day...Amen.

Keep looking up, He knows our every weakness...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
