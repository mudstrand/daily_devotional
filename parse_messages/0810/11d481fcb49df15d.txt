10/29/08~~~(food for thought)~~~God gives strength to those who rely on Him...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith ~ 
and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God ~

not by works, so that no one can boast...(Eph. 2:8, 9) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

When someone gives you a gift, do you say, "That's very nice~ 
now how much do I owe you?"

NO, the appropriate response to a gift is "Thank you!" Yet
how often do Christians, even after they have been given the
gift of salvation, feel obligated to try to work their way to God...

Because our Salvation and even our faith are gifts, we should 
respond with gratitude, praise, and joy...

Our Prayer for Today:
I thank You dear Lord for the gift of eternal life, even
the gift of faith. Forgive me for all the times I have felt
I had to work a bit harder to be worthy. Help me Lord
to be a better witness to those who do not know about
the free gift of eternal life...Amen

Keep looking up, God's grace awaits 
those who come to Him in faith...
You are in the Prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
