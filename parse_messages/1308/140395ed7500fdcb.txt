Today's Verses: Psalms 3:1-3 (NLT)

1 O Lord, I have so many enemies; so many are against me.

2 So many are saying, "God will never rescue him!" 
3 But You, O Lord, are a shield around me; You are my glory, the one who
holds my head high. 



Today's Thoughts:

David was not sitting on his throne in a place of power, but he was running
for his life

from his rebellious son, Absalom, and a group of traitors. . .



When circumstances go against us, it is tempting to think that God is also
against us.

But David reminds us that the opposite is true. When everything seems to go
against 

us, God is still for us. . .



So if circumstance has turned against you-don't blame God-seek Him. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, as this life sends many trials my way, I pray that

Your Holy Spirit would make me mindful that You are but a prayer away.

Guide, direct, and be my shield. . . Amen.



Phil. 4:8 Fix your thoughts on what is true and honorable and right.
