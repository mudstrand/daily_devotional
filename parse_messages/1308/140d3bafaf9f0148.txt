Today's Verses: Psalms 9:1-3 (NLT)

I will praise you, Lord, with all my heart; I will tell of all the marvelous
things you have done.

2 I will be filled with joy because of you. I will sing praises to your
name, O Most High. 
3 My enemies retreated; they staggered and died when you appeared. 

Today's Thoughts:

When we express our praises to God we are showing our appreciation and
understanding of His worth. . .

It is saying thank You for each of the aspects of His divine nature. . .

In doing so our inward attitude becomes an outward expression. . .

When we praise God, we help ourselves by expanding our awareness of who He
is. . .



To further this awareness, in each Psalm you read, look for an attribute or
characteristic 

of God for which you can thank Him for. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear heavenly Father there are many marvelous things of which I could give
you praise.

Today I would just like to praise and thank You for providing the way of
salvation 

through Your Son, or Lord Jesus Christ. Guide me in the path of
righteousness. . .Amen.
