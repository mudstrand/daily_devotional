HERE IS FRIDAY'S DEVO. AS I WILL BE IN ST. CLOUD



Today's Verse: Psalms 8:6 (NLT)

6 You put us in charge of everything You made, giving us authority over all
things.



Today's Thoughts:

God gave us human tremendous authority, to be in charge of the whole earth.

But with great authority comes great responsibility. If we own a pet, we
have

the legal authority to do with it as we wish, but we also have a
responsibility 

to feed and care for it.

How have you treated God's creation? Remember we are to use our resources
wisely

because God holds us accountable as stewards. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, Help me remember my responsibilities today so that I may be a
good steward. . .Amen.
