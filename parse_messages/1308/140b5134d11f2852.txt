Today's Verses: Psalms 7:9 (NLT) 

End the evil of those who are wicked, and defend the righteous. 

For you look deep within the mind and heart, O righteous God. 



Today's Thoughts:

OH YES! God looks "deep within in the mind and heart." Nothing is hidden
from God-

Now this can either be terrifying or comforting. Our thoughts are an open
book to God.



OH YES! Let us also remember that He also knows our motives-we have no
place to hide-

No way we can pretend to get away with sin-BUT that knowledge can also give
us comfort.

We don't have to impress God or put up a false front.



Instead-we can trust God to help us work through our weaknesses in order to
serve Him

as He has planned-when we truly follow God, He rewards our efforts. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Thank You Lord, for Your Love and faithfulness. My request today is that You

Will help me avoid my weaknesses so that I may serve You according to Your
plan. . . Amen.
