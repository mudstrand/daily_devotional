Today's Verses: Psalms 6:1-3 (NLT)

1 O Lord, don't rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your rage.

2 Have compassion on me, Lord, for I am weak. Heal me, Lord, for my bones
are in agony.

3 I am sick at heart. How long, O Lord, until you restore me? 



Today's Thoughts:

David accepted God's punishment-but he begged God not to discipline him in
anger.

Jeremiah also asked God to correct him gently and not in anger (Jer. 10:24).
. .



David recognized that if God treated him with justice alone and not with
mercy, he

would be wiped out by God's wrath.



Often we want God to show mercy to us and justice to everyone else.

BUT-God in His kindness forgives us instead of giving us what we deserve.



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, it is only by Your grace and mercy that I can come before You

seeking Your divine forgiveness. So I beg of You forgive my sins of thought-

word-and deed. Bless all my E-mail friends with safety and good health. . .
Amen.
