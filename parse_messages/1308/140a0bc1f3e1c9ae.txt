Today's Verses: Psalms 5:5-8 (NLT)

5 Therefore, the proud may not stand in your presence, for you hate all who
do evil.

6 You will destroy those who tell lies. The Lord detests murderers and
deceivers. 
7 Because of your unfailing love, I can enter your house; I will worship at
your Temple with deepest awe.

8 Lead me in the right path, O Lord, or my enemies will conquer me. Make
your way plain for me to follow. 



Today's Thoughts:

God cannot condone or even excuse the smallest sin-SO we cannot excuse
ourselves for sinning only

A little bit-as we grow spiritually, our sensitivity to sin will also
increase. . .



What is your reaction to sin in your life?

Are you insensitive-unconcerned-disappointed-or comfortable?



As God makes us aware of sin-we must be intolerant toward it and be willing
to change.

All believers should strive to be more tolerant of people-BUT-less tolerant
of the sins in 

others and themselves. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, help me to recognize my own sins as easily as I see
the sins of others.

Lead me in the right path-make Your way plain to me. . . Amen.
