Today's Verses: Psalms 7:14-16 (NLT)

14 The wicked conceive evil; they are pregnant with trouble and give birth
to lies.

15 They dig a deep pit to trap others, then fall into it themselves.

16 The trouble they make for others backfires on them. The violence they
plan falls on their own heads. 



Today's Thoughts:

When allowed to run its course, evil often destroys itself. Violent people
become

victims of violence and liars become victims of others' deceit. BUT in the
process

innocent people are hurt-

Sometimes God intervenes and stops evil doers in their tracks in order to
protect 

His followers-At other times, for reasons known only to Him, God allows evil


to continue even though innocent people are hurt. . .



It is during these times that we must ask God to protect us-Remember God
will

execute final justice although it may not be during our lifetime. . . 



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, we are living in sinful times, drugs and violence of every kind

are prevalent and our young people are in the midst of it all, protect Your

followers from this evil that plagues our country. . . Amen
