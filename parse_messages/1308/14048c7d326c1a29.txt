Today's Verse: Psalms 4:3 

You can be sure of this: The Lord set apart the godly for himself. 

The Lord will answer when I call to him. 



Today's Thoughts:

The godly are those who are faithful and devoted to God. David knew that God
would hear him

when he called and would answer him-We too, can be confident that God
listens to our prayers

And answers when we call upon Him-



Sometimes we think that God will not hear us because we have fallen short of
His high standards

for holy living. BUT if we have trusted Christ for salvation, God has
forgiven us, and He will listen

to us. . .



When you feel that your prayers are bouncing off the ceiling, remember as a
believer you have

been set apart by God and that He loves you. He hears and answers--although
His answers may

not be what you expected-look at your problems in light of God's power
instead of looking at

God in the shadow of your problems. 



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, in the midst of my problems strengthen my faith

so that I would never doubt that You hear or answer my prayers. . . Amen.
