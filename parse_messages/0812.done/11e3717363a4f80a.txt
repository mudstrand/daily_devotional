Hello;
We just want to tell everyone that we are so grateful to have each of
you in our life.We pray you all have a blessed day. It was difficult
for us to decide who we thought would DO this because many people
claim to pray, but don't. We hope we selected the right twelve. Please
send this back to us. (You'll see why.)

May everyone who receives this message be blessed. There are 12
months/12 disciples/12 tribes of Israel/Jesus' birth celebrated in the
12th month. There is nothing attached. Just send this to twelve
others. Prayer is one of the best free gifts we receive. There is no
cost, just a lot of rewards. Make sure you pray, and pray believing
God will answer.

May today be all you need it to be. May the Peace of God and the
freshness of the Holy Spirit rest in your thoughts, rule in your
dreams tonight, and conquer all your fears. May God manifest himself
today in ways you have never experienced. May your joys be fulfilled,
your dreams be closer, and your prayers be answered. We pray that
faith enters a new height for you; we pray that your territory is
enlarged, we pray for peace, healing, health, happiness, prosperity,
joy, truth and undying love for God.

Now send this to 12 people within 5 minutes and remember to send this
back. We count as 2, you'll see why. Suggestion: copy and paste

Have a Blessed Day!
