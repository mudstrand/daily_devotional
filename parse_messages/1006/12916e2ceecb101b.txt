06/08/2010~~~food for thought~~~WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?

Our Bible Verses for Today:
I always thank God for you because of His grace given you in Christ Jesus. 
For in Him you have been enriched in every way. (I Cor. 1:4, 5)

Our Lesson for Today:
I don't want to be a millionaire. I am one! ~ My bank account is nothing to brag about.
My dollar and cents value is slight compared to may others. But I am rich, thanks to 
God's grace...

What else would you call someone who has the dollars of Christ's forgiveness to cover 
all his or her sins? who has the priceless pearl of peace with God through Jesus' blood? 
who carries in the portfolio of life God's grace to enrich him or her in every way...

The gift of the Savior, of the gospel through which I learn of that Savior, of faith in that Savior -- 
all this, Paul says, is due to the grace of God in Jesus Christ...

Prayer Suggestion:
Thank You Lord, for making me rich in Jesus.
Please tighten my grip on heaven's treasures...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
