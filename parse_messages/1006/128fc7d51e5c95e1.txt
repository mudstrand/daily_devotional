06/03/2010~~~food for thought~~~MY GIFT CERTIFICATE FROM GOD

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who has blest us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual
blessing in Christ...(Eph. 1:3) 

Our Lesson for Today;
"Who has blest us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms"
means that in Christ we have all the benefits of ~ knowing God ~ being chosen
for salvation ~ being adopted as His Children ~ forgiveness ~ insight ~ the
gifts of the spirit ~ power to do God's will ~ the hope of living forever with
Christ...

If we have an intimate relationship with Christ, we can enjoy these blessings now.
The "heavenly realms" means these blessings are eternal, not temporal. These
blessings come from Christ's spiritual realm...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, give me the hand of faith to receive and use Your
blessings faithfully...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to he father except through me." - John: 14:6
