06/28/2010~~~food for thought~~~JESUS ~ SERVANT

Our Bible Verse for Today:
For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve,
and give His life as a ransom for many...Mk. 10:45

Our Lesson for Today:
Have you ever said, "I wish I would have lived when Jesus walked the earth
so I could have been feed with the five thousand?"

Well guess what He's still serving today. 
At the baptismal font He sent His Spirit to put the sign of the cross on your 
heart to show that He has redeemed you.

Through His Word ~ as you use it ~ He offers you the wholesome food of
His forgiveness.

At His communion table, He gives you His most precious body and blood
with the bread and wine to assure you that His forgiveness is real and that
your sins are gone...

Never does He tire of serving us in these wonderful ways...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to never grow tired or bored with
Your service so that one day I can sit at Your banquet
table in heaven...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
