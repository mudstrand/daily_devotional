06/25/2010~~~food for thought~~~LOVE MADE HIM DO IT

Our Bible Verse for Today:
I will do what the Father requires of Me, so that the world
will know that I love the Father. (Jn. 14:31)

Our Lesson for Today:
The Father had commanded. The Son in love obeyed. We know the rest of the story.
The pain of the cross and the pangs of hell, the depth of suffering and the darkness
of the grave that Jesus endured in love for His Father...

Oh yes and we even know more. Jesus raised from the grave by the Father. 
His resurrection was the Father's loud Easter "Amen" to His Son's Good Friday shout
"It is finished." ~ "Well done," His Father said. "Well done because of Your love for 
Me and for sinners."

All this Jesus did, not just out of love for His Father but also for us...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord help me marvel at the great love that brought
You down to the cross to save me...Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
