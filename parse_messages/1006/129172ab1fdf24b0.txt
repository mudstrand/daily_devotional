Our Bible Verse for Today:
He [God] will keep you strong to the end, so that you will be blameless
on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ... (I Cor. 1:8)

Our Lesson for Today:
Earthly riches are so slippery. Needs in life pry them loose from our hands.
falling stock markets reduce their value. Death transfers them to someone else.

Spiritual millionaires can also lose the riches God has given them. Satan knows 
what schemes to use to flush the treasures of Christ's forgiveness from our hearts.
The treasures, temptations, and trials of this world are capable crowbars in his 
devilish hands...

With them he often succeeds in his breakingand entering attempts into a believers
heart. No wonder the Lord warns us that only those who endure in faith till the end
will be saved...

But the Lord has a promise for us, "[I] Will keep you strong to the end," He says.
He will see to it that we can stand blameless when we step before His throne in
heaven. BUT we need to stay close to the Savior through Word and sacrament.
Through these means the Spirit keeps faith's fingers wrapped around God's
children...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, don't let me lose heaven's treasures.
strengthen my faith through Your Spirit's work...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
