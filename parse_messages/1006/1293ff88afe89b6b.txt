06/16/2010~~~food for thought~~~DON'T LET TROUBLES BECOME WEDGES...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, 
or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or
sword? ~ In all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through 
Him who loved us...(Ro. 8:35, 37)

Our Lesson for Today:
Paul answers his own question emphatically "No."
Troubles cannot separate us from the love of Christ. In fact, because of Christ's
amazing love "we are more than conquerors" in the day of trouble...

The Savior's love for us is no hit-or-miss affair. It's never, "Now I love you; now I don't."
It's constant in all the scenes of life. His cross is the plus sign for our life. It's the 
guarantee that His love that laid down His life for our salvation also will lead us in our
daily life...

Like some Kevlar vest, His love protects us. Though the bullets of trouble may bruise, 
they cannot kill us. Because of Christ's great love, we can view the problems of life
as the golden twine by which He ties us closer...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, keep my eyes on Your cross so that 
I am more sure of Your love in my life...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to The father except through me." - John: 14:6
