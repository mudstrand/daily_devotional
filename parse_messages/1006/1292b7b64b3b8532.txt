06/12/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE WONDER OF SALVATION...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless,
Christ died for the ungodly. (Ro. 5:6)

Our Lesson for Today:
How often do we look at the cross on the altar and remember what it means?
Do you know why it is there? ~ it is there as a reminder of what Christ has done
for us...

But it's so smooth and shiny ~ nothing at all like the crude wood on which the
Savior was suspended between heaven and earth. It is so easy to forget the
horrible cross and Christ suffering hell's pangs for the ungodly...

Sometimes when I look at myself, I seem smooth and shinny also. But Paul
describes us as "Ungodly". Yet God has chosen us as His co-workers.
what an amazing thought...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to remember and marvel that what the
Savior did ~ He did for me...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
