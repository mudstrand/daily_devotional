06/17/2010~~~food for thought~~~GOD'S SUPER GLUE...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
I am convinced that neither death nor life ~ nor anything else in all creation,
will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus. (Ro. 8:38, 39)

Our Lesson for Today:
Do you remember the catchy TV commercial they used when Super Glue came on the 
market? They showed a 200-some-pound football player suspended in his helmet,
which was glued with Super-Glue to a goal post...

Super-Glue is still going strong. ~ BUT far stronger is the glue of which Paul speaks,
It's God's love for us. His love is so powerful that nothing can ever rip us loose from it.
Nothing in life can do it, regardless how bad. Nothing the future can bring, regardless
how bleak. Not even death, no matter how certain, we just can not be separated from 
God's love. ~ That love binds every believer to God for all eternity...

When I look at my faith to believe all this, I again see His love, which has worked such
trust in my heart...

Prayer Suggestion:
O God, help me always to turn to Your love and trust it to work
in life and death for me...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
