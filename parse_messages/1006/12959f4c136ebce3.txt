06/21/2010~~~food for thought~~~NO OTHER NAME

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under 
heaven given to men by which we must be saved...(Acts 4:12)

Our Lesson for Today:
I guess we shouldn't expect the world to be excited when it hears that only
the name of Jesus brings salvation. Intellectuals in the class room and in print, 
if they speak about salvation at all, seek for answers in the supposed goodness
of man...

Yes modern day Pharisees, inside and outside the church, still point to their own
works. In spite of all the failures of past centuries, they are still persistent in their 
errors...

All our human efforts are like trying to build a stairway to heaven without steps,
when God has already let down a living ladder in His Son, Jesus. Let us remember
to praise God each day for His Son Jesus, so like an escalator on which we need to
simply stand, holding on with the hand of faith, to be lifted up to everlasting life...

Pray Suggestion:
Dear Lord, for me let it be Jesus, Jesus, only Jesus
when it comes to my salvation...Amen
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
