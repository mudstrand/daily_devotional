Our Bible Verses for Today:
What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?
Thanks be to God - through Jesus Christ our Lord! (Ro. 7:24, 25)

Our Lesson for Today:
This inward struggle with sin was as real to Paul as it is with us.
From Paul we learn what to do about it. Whenever Paul felt lost, 
He would return to the beginning of his spiritual life, remembering
that he had already been freed by Jesus Christ...

When we feel confused and overwhelmed by sin's appeal, we need
to follow Paul's example. Thank God that He has given us freedom
through Jesus Christ...

Today let the reality of Christ's power lift you up to real victory over sin...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, forgive me when my sinful flesh wins.
Strengthen me for my walk as Your child...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to he father except through me." - John: 14:6
