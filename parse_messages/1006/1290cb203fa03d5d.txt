06/06/2010~~~food for thought~~~SAVED BY GRACE FOR GOOD WORKS...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
For we are God's masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus,
so that we can do good things He has planned for us long ago...(Eph. 2:10)

Our Lesson for Today:
Yes Scripture stresses that we are saved by God's grace in Christ Jesus alone,
but some object, "You mean you can do what you want, sin all you please, and 
you're still saved?" ~~~

Sorry but that is not what Paul says. He describes the believer as "God's workmanship,
created ~ To do good works." As a believer, I am a unique design of the God of 
all grace. He who put faith in the Savior into my heart expects me to show it in my
daily life.

He wants me to follow His Son's example in life, not as a cause for salvation but 
as a result of it. He wants me, like some child who has received a wonderful
Christmas present, to throw my arms around His neck in appreciation for what I
have received...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, Thank You for The wonderful gift of salvation.
Help me use my life to thank You every day...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
