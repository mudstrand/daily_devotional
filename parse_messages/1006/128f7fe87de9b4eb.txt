06/02/2010~~~food for thought~~~DON'T EVER FORGET HIS NAME...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Therefore God exalted Him to the highest place and gave Him a name that
is above every name. that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow. (Phil. 2:9, 10)

Our Lesson for Today:
If I had but one name to remember, whose would it be? Paul reminds me clearly, 
he says, "Jesus." In fact, he says that Jesus' name is above every name. And 
because of what Jesus has done every knee should bow....

What has He done? Because of His work I can be God's child and live with Him forever.
YES His name is above every name. He's my only Savior...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, in Your mercy, write my name next to the name
of Your Son in Your book of life...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
