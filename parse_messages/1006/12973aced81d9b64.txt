06/26/2010~~~food for thought~~~JESUS ~~~ THE WORD

Our Bible Verse for Today:
He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His title
was the Word of God...(Rev. 19:13)

Our Lesson for Today:
What does Jesus, the Word, show us about His Father's love? Plain and simple
it shows us something that we really need to know. It shows us that our Father's 
heart overflows with love for us...

Instead of flinging us aside in our sins as we deserve, He sent His Son to earth
to tell us about His love. And He did not send Jesus only to speak but also act.
Jesus dipped His robe of life into His own blood on Calvary's cross...

His suffering for our sins truly displays a Father's heart that would do anything to 
save us. Jesus is God's love in capital letters...

I can't see the living Word in person today. But I can turn to the written Word.
In it I see Jesus, and in Him, my Father's heart of love...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, teach me to love Your sacred Word
and to view my Savior there...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
