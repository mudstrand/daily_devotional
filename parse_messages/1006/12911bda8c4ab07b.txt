06/07/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE GREAT EXCHANGE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we
might become the righteousness of God...(II Cor. 5:21)

Our Lesson for Today:
Have you ever thought about the great exchange? Well when we trust in Christ,
we make an exchange; He takes our sins and makes us right with God.

Yes our sin was laid on Him at His crucifixion. His righteousness is given to us at our conversion.
This is what Christians mean by Christ's atonement for sin. In the world, bartering works only 
when two people exchange goods of like value. But God offers to trade His righteousness for 
our sin ~ something of immeasurable worth for something completely worthless...

How grateful we should be for His kindness to us...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, thank You for charging my sins to Jesus
and crediting His righteousness to me...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
