Our Bible Verse for Today:
You were bought at a price...(I Cor. 6:20a)

Our Lesson for Today:
What Paul is actually saying is, "your body belongs to God."

Many people say they have the right to do whatever they want with their own bodies.
although they think that this is freedom, they are really enslaved to their own desires.
When we become Christians, the Holy Spirit comes to live in us. SO, we no longer
own our bodies...

That God bought us "with a high price" refers to slaves purchased at an auction.
Christ's death freed us from sin but also obligates us to His service. If you live in
a building owned by someone else, you try not to violate the building rules. Because
your body belongs to God, you must not violate His standards for living, or deface His
property...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I know that my body is Your property, help
me to not violate Your building rules...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
