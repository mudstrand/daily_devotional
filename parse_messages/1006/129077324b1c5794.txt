Our Bible Verses for Today:
At that time you were ~~~ foreigners to the covenant of the promise ~~~ 
But now ~~~ you who were once far away have been brought near
through the blood of Christ... (Eph. 2:12, 13)

Our Lesson for Today:
When our forefathers came to this country, they needed a sponsor to guarantee 
financial support for them. ~ The rule was no sponsor, no entry...

Our sponsor for citizenship in God's kingdom is Christ Jesus. He gave His life,
33 years of perfectly keeping all of God's laws for us...

He gave His life, six hours of unimaginable torture on a cross for us. ~ Because
of the life He led and the blood He shed, He is our guarantee of full citizenship
in heaven. This citizenship is ours the moment the spirit works faith in Christ in
our heart...

There is no waiting period ~ no questions to answer. Just full-fledged citizenship 
in the most wonderful country of all ~~ And all because of Christ...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, thank You for making me a citizen of
Your heaven through faith in Jesus...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
