Our Bible Verse for Today:
Who is He that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died - more than that, who was 
raised to life - is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. (Ro. 8:34)

Our Lesson for Today:
Have you ever thought that because you aren't good enough for God, He will not 
save you? ~ Do you ever feel as if salvation is for everyone else but you? Then
this verse is especially for you...

If God gave His Son for you, He isn't going to hold back the gift of salvation.
If Christ gave His life for you, He isn't going to turn around and condemn you!
He will not withhold anything you need to live for Him...

The book of Romans is more than a theological explanation of God's redeeming
grace ~ it is a letter of comfort and confidence addressed to you...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, thank you for Jesus' payment for my sins
and for Your resulting acquittal of me...Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
