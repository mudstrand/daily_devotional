06/20/2010~~~food for thought~~~NEVER ~ NEGLECT TO DO GOOD

Our Bible Verses for Today:
The Jewish leaders began harassing Jesus for breaking the Sabbath rules.
But Jesus replied, My Father never stops working, so why should I ?"
(Jn. 5:16, 17)

Our Lesson for Today:
IF God stopped every kind of work on the Sabbath, nature would fall into chaos, 
and sin would overrun the world. Genesis 2:2 says that God rested on the
seventh day, but this can't mean He stopped doing good...

Because of His unity with God, Jesus lived as God wanted Him to live.
Because of our identification with Jesus, we must honor Him and live as 
He wants us to. And so Jesus teaches that when to opportunity to do good 
presents itself, it should not be ignored, even on the Sabbath.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to always be alert to the needs of others...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6

Hey all you men, have a good, safe and happy Father's Day!!!
