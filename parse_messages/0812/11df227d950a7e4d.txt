Our Bible Verse for Today:

So whether you eat or drink or what ever you do, 
do it all for the glory of God...(I Cor. 10:31) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

It is important that we show glory and honor to God through
our life, not just through words or spiritual acts. Start seeing
ordinary daily routines as something done for God, not
just something to check off your list so you can search for
God amidst things you think are holy...

All of life is holy if lived unto the Lord. Remember Col. 3:23 
teaches us to work heartily at every task, for the Lord and not
for men...

God assigns us the ordinary things of life as well as spiritual 
things like prayer, Bible study, and good works. He tells us
throughout His Word to work, pay bills, take care of our homes 
and bodies, fellowship with other believers, enjoy our food, 
rest and laugh...

Dividing the sacred from the secular causes us to live disjointed 
lives where we always rush through the things we see as mundane
in order to get to the spiritual activities we feel God is pleased with...

Remember, we are told to "pray without ceasing". How can we do
this unless we realize all of a life lifted up to God becomes a prayer, 
a type of living intercession?

What truly makes life simple is having an intimate relationship with
Christ; following His principles, loving Him for who He is and not just
for what He can do for us...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Forgive me for the times I have
lived only for self. Help me to see all that I do as giving
glory to You, or the good of my fellowman. Help me to be
true to Your principles, help me to live in an attitude of love
and prayer...Amen.

Keep looking up, in a loving attitude 
and endless prayer...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather


This will be the last e-mail devo, until I can use my 
right arm again ~~~ If I am crippled for six weeks
as the doctor says may be possible, Marcie and I 
wish you all a blessed Christmas and a Happy New Year...
