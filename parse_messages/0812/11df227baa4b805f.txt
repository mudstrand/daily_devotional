Poem is right on, but info at the end is what is important!


Welfare Poem - 




I cross ocean, 
poor and broke, 
Take bus, 
see employment folk. 
Nice man treat me 
good in there, 
Say I need to 
see welfare. 
Welfare say, 
'You come no more, 
We send cash 
right to your door.' 
Welfare checks, 
they make you wealthy, 
Medicaid it keep 
you healthy! 
By and by, 
I get plenty money, 
Thanks to you, 
American dummy. 
Write to friends 
in motherland, 
Tell them 'come 
fast as you can.' 
They come in turbans 
and Ford trucks, 
I buy big house 
with welfare bucks 
They come here, 
we live together, 
More welfare checks, 
it gets better! 
Fourteen families, 
they moving in, 
But neighbor's patience 
wearing thin. 
Finally, white guy 
moves away, 
Now I buy his house, 
and then I say, 'Find more aliens 
for house to rent.' 
And in the yard 
I put a tent. 
Send for family 
they just trash, 
But they, too, 
draw the welfare cash! 
Everything is 
very good, 
And soon we 
own the neighborhood. 
We have hobby 
it's called breeding, 
Welfare pay 
for baby feeding. 
Kid's need dentist? 
Wife's need pills? 
We get free! 
We got no bills! 
American's crazy! 
He pay all year, 
To keep welfare 
running here. 
We think America darn good place! 
Too darn good for the white man race. 
If they no like us, they can scram, 
Got lots of room in Pakistan It is interesting that the federal government provides a 
single refugee with 
a monthly allowance of $1,890.00 and each can also get an 
additional $580.00 
in social assistance for a total of $2,470.00 . 
This compares very well to a single pensioner who after 
contributing to the 
growth and development of America for 40 to 50 years can 
only receive a 
monthly maximum of $1,012.00 in old age pension and 
Guaranteed Income 
Supplement. Maybe our pensioners should apply as refugees! 
Lets send this to all Americans, so we can all be ticked 
off and maybe we 
can get the refugees cut back to $1,012.00 and the 
pensioners up to $2,470 
00 and enjoy some of the money we were forced to submit to the Government over the last 40 or 
50 years. 
Please forward to every American to expose what our elected 
politicians have 
been doing over the past 11 years - to the over-taxed 
American. SEND THIS TO EVERY AMERICAN TAXPAYER YOU KNOW
