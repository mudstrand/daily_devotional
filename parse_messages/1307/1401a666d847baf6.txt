Today's Verse: Psalms 1:1 (NLT)

" Oh, the joys of those who do not follow the advice of the wicked, 

or stand around with sinners, or join in with mockers." 



Today's Thoughts:

When picking our friends or associates we need to be care as to what road

they may take us down-because they can have a profound influence on us,

often in subtle ways. . .



If we chose friendship with those who mock what God considers important,

we might sin by becoming indifferent to God's will. This kind of attitude is

the same as mocking-we need to make a close examination of the life of

our friends, do they build up our faith-or do they tear it down. . .



True friends should help us draw closer to God, not hinder. . .



Today's Suggested Prayer:

Dear Heavenly Father, grant me the wisdom to chose my friends wisely.

Help me to stay on the path that leads to eternal life. . . Amen.



"Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." Pro. 1:7
