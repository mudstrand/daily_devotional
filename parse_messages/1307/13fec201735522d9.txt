Today's Verse: 2 Cor. 12:9 (NLT)

"My gracious favor is all you need-My power works best in your weakness.



Today's Thoughts:

Although God did not remove Paul's affliction, He promised to demonstrate

His power in Paul. The fact that God's power is displayed in our weakness

should give us courage and hope-



As we recognize our limitations, we will depend more on God for our
effectiveness

rather than our own energy, effort, or talent. If we swallow our pride we
would realize

that our limitation not only help us develop Christian character but also
deepen our 

worship, because in admitting our weaknesses, we affirm God's strength. . .



Today's Suggested Prayer:

Dear Heavenly Father, help me to recognize my limitations, and the courage
to admit 

that in my own strength I am a weak and hope less human being, but I can do
all thing

by Your power. Be Thou My Strength Today. . . Amen.
