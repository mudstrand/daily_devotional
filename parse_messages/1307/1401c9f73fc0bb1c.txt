There comes a time when a woman just has to trust her husband.

For example-

A wife comes home early from a late trip at night, and quietly opens 

the door to her bedroom.

From under the blanket she sees four legs instead of two.

She reaches for a baseball bat and starts hitting the blanket as hard as she
can.

Leaving the covered bodies groaning, she goes down to the kitchen to have a
drink.



As she enters, she see her husband there, reading a magazine.

"Hi Darling". He says, your parents have come to visit us, so I let them
stay in

our bedroom. Did you say hello?"



Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

"I am the way and the truth and the life.

No one comes to the Father except through me." John 14:6
