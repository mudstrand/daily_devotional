Today's Verses: Ps. 1:4-6

4 But not the wicked! They are like worthless chaff, scattered by the wind.

5 They will be condemned at the time of judgment. Sinners will have no place
among the godly.

6 For the Lord watches over the path of the godly, but the path of the
wicked leads to destruction. 



Today's Thoughts:

God does not judge people on the basis of race, sex, or national origin.

He judges them on the basis of their faith in Him and their response to 

His revealed will. Those who diligently try to obey God's will are blessed. 

They are like healthy, fruit-bearing trees planted along a river bank with

strong roots (Jer. 17:7,8), and God promises to watch over them. . .



God's wisdom will guide their lives. In contrast, those who do not trust 

and obey Him have meaningless lives that blow away like dust. So be

sure to choose God's path, because the path you choose determines how

you spend eternity. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, it is my sincere prayer that Your will be ever clear

to me, that I may not stray from Your path and loose Your eternal blessing.
. . Amen.
