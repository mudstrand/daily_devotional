Today's Verse: Jn. 14:21

Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me. And
because they love me, 

my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of
them." 



Today's Thoughts:

I think we have all wished at one time or another that we could know the
future,

so we could prepare for it. God has chosen not to give us this knowledge.
He alone

knows what will happen, but He tells us all we need to know to prepare for
the

future. . . When we live by His standards He will not leave us-He will come
to

us-He will be with us-and He will show Himself to us. . .



God knows what will happen, and because He will be with us through it all,
we

need not fear. We don't have to know the future to have faith in God, BUT we

need to have faith in Him to feel secure about the future. . .



Jesus said that His followers show their love for Him by obeying Him. Love
is 

more that lovely words-it is commitment and conduct. If you love Christ,
then 

prove it by obeying what He says in His Word. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord I will keep Your promise by the power of Your Holy Spirit.

I ask You just now to come into my heart and reveal Yourself to me. . .
Amen.
