Today's Verse: Jn. 8:34-35

34 Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave of
sin.

35 A slave is not a permanent member of the family, but a son is part of the
family forever 



Today's Thoughts:

Jesus had no time for sin-WHY? Because sin has a way of enslaving us-

Controlling us-dominating us-and dictating our actions-SO what is the
remedy?

Well Jesus can free you from this slavery that keeps you from becoming the
person

God has created you to be. . .

If sin is restraining, mastering, or enslaving you-Jesus can break its power
over your life.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:



Dear Lord, I lift my heart up to You today sincerely grateful for the
opportunities of another day.

Guide and direct me today so all that I do would be pleasing to You. Keep me
mindful that all

Depends on my possessing your abundant grace and blessing. . .Amen.
