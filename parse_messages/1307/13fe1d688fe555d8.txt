Today's Verse: Jn. 8:12

"I am the light of the world. If you follow me, you won't have to walk in
darkness, 

because you will have the light that leads to life." 



Today's Thoughts: 

Jesus called Himself the "Light of the World." As such He represented God's
presence-

protection-and guidance. And as such He is the "Light of the World."



Jesus gives us an option-"If you follow me," From this option, a question
arises which seems strange to Christians-

but it has been asked-"What does it mean to follow Jesus?" WELL-

As a soldier follows his captain, so we should follow Christ, our commander.

As a slave follows his master, so we should follow Christ, or Lord.

As we follow the advice of a trusted counselor, so we should follow Jesus'
commands to us in Scripture.

As we follow the laws of our nation, so we should follow the laws of the
Kingdom of Heaven.



Let us be found faithful-in following the "Light that leads to life-eternal
life. . .



Today's Suggested Prayer:

Dear Lord, help me to live this day walking in Your light.

Let His Cross be my glory and His favor my crown. . . Amen.
