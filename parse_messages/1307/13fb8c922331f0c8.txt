Today's Verse: Matt 28:18 (Jesus said)

"I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth. 



Today's Thoughts:

Just think of what the disciples had learned to know the power of Christ
Jesus

here on earth. And yet that was just a little thing as compared with the
greater 

works that He was now to do in and through them-



He has the power to work even in the feeblest of His servants with the
strength

of the Almighty God. He has power even to use their apparent weakness to

carry out His purposes. He has the power over every enemy and every human

heart, over every difficulty and danger. . .



But let us remember that this power is never meant to be experienced as if
it 

were our own. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, Although I am unable to carry out Your purposes, I trust in Your 

power over every enemy, and over every danger and difficulty. . . Amen.
