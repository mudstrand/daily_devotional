Today's Verse: Phil 4:6-7 (NLT)

6 Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what
you need, and thank him for all he has done.

7 Then you will experience God's peace, which exceeds anything we can
understand. His peace will guard your hearts and 

minds as you live in Christ Jesus 



Today's Thoughts:

Can you imagine never worrying about anything-in our human thinking it seems
like an impossibility.

We've all had worries about a job, our homes, our families, we could go on
and on about things we 

have worried about at one time or another. But Paul's advice is that we
turn our worries into prayer.



SO-do you want to worry less-then pray more. . . Whenever you start to
worry-stop and pray. . .

If you do this Paul says-then you will experience God's peace. God's peace
is different than the world's

peace. True peace is not found in positive thinking, in the absence of
conflict, or in good feelings. . .

It comes from knowing that God is in control.-It also comes from knowing
that our citizenship in

Christ's kingdom is sure.-and that our destiny is set.-Let God's peace guard
your heart against anxiety.



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, forgive me for being anxious about worldly things-help me to
place my trust in You.

The next time I begin to worry may Your Holy Spirit encourage me to pray
more. . .Amen.
