Today's Verse: Gal. 6:14

As for me, may I never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord
Jesus Christ. Because of 

that cross, my interest in this world has been crucified, and the world's
interest in me has also died. 



Today's Thoughts:

I believe the reason we do not glory in the Cross as we should-is that we do
not expect

and enjoy His abiding presence as we should. Nor do we glory in the Cross by
which we

were crucified to the world.



Remember that Scriptures tell us that we were crucified with Christ; our
"old man was 

Crucified with Him", they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with
its affections and 

lusts-and yet how little we have learned that the world has been crucified
to us and that 

we are free from its power. . .



Yes how little we have learned. As those who are crucified with Christ, to
deny ourselves,

to have the mind that was in Christ when He emptied Himself and took the
form of a

servant and humbled Himself and became obedient even to the death of the
Cross. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord Jesus-Let us learn the lesson, it is You the crucified Christ,

Who comes to walk with us every day, and in whose power we too are

to live the life that can say: "I have been crucified with Christ"

"Christ lives in me." Amen.
