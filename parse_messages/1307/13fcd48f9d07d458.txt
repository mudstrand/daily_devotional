Today's Verse: Rev. 7:17; 14:4

For the Lamb on the throne will be their Shepherd. He will lead them to
springs of life-giving water. 

And God will wipe every tear from their eyes." These are those which follow
the Lamb wherever he goes. 



Today's Thoughts:

In verses 1-8 we see the believers receiving a seal to protect them through
a time of-

Great tribulation and suffering-

In verses 9-17 we see the believers finally with God in heaven. All who have
been faithful

Through the ages they are singing before God's throne. Their tribulations
and sorrows are over:

No more tears for sin, for all sins are forgiven-

No more tears for suffering, for all suffering is over-

No more tears for death, for all believers have been resurrected to die no
more. . .



So let us stay on the path of the Lord-and follow Him. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father I believe that Christ is the embodiment of You-

The everlasting God-and of Your love-and He is my Shepherd and

Keeper. . . Amen.
