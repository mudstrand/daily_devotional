Today's Verse: Jn. 4:42

"This is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the World."



Today's Thoughts:

Yes it is Jesus Christ who saves His people from their sins, who rules over
a people

willing in the day of His power and proves in them that He enables them to
say-

"I delight to do Thy will, O my God," who says, "Lo I am with you always."



The abiding presence of the Savior from sin is promised to all who have
accepted Him

in the fullness of His redeeming power and who preach by their lives as well
as by their words

what a wonderful Savior He is. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord Jesus, You are truly the Savior of the world and the Redeemer of
all.

We have heard Your command to go into all the world and preach the Gospel

and to obey all that You have commanded-forgive me where I have failed. . .
Amen
