03/04/2010~~~~food for thought~~~FOR ME HE WAS CRUCIFIED...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
When I tried to keep the law, I realized I could never earn God's approval.
So I died to the law so that I might live for God. I have been crucified with
Christ...(Gal 2:19)

Our Lesson for Today:
Through the study of the Old Testament Scriptures, Paul realized that he 
could not be save by obeying God's laws. The prophets knew that God's 
plan of salvation did not rest on keeping the law...

The reason is we have all been infected by sin, and so we can not keep God's
law perfectly. BUT fortunately, God has provided a way of salvation that depends
on Jesus Christ, not on our own efforts...

Even though we know this truth, we must guard against the temptation of using
service, good deeds, charitable giving, OR any other effort as a substitute for faith...

Prayer Suggestion:
Thank You Lord, for being a substitute for me...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
