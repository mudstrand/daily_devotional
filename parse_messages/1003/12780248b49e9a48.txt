03/21/2010~~~food for thought~~~HOSANNA TO OUR KING...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Tell the people of Israel, 'Look, your King is coming to you. 
He is humble, riding on a donkey ~ even on a donkey's colt.' (Mt. 21:5)

Our Lesson for Today:
Some would say, 'What kind of King would ride a donkey in a parade?'
There were no chariots with armed guards ~ No marching bands ~ No
prancing steeds.' "Hosanna," they shouted to Him, but what kind of
King was He?

Well my answer is, ~ Jesus is the eternal God whose throne fills the 
heavens and whose scepter casts it's shadow over all the earth. But 
yes, He rides into Jerusalem in all lowliness to show that He's also man.

Yes He became one of us, took on our flesh to do what none of us could 
do, to carry out the heavenly mission of salvation. Because he came ~
in such humble form, many missed Him. Oh yes, they cheered when that
strange parade went by, but they went home and forgot all about Him.

But thank God He hasn't forgotten me. His coming in the flesh and His
humble entrance into Jerusalem were His way of saying, "How could I
ever forget you? I've become one of you. I came to be with you and to 
die for you on Calvary's cross." So let us sing: "Hosanna to the Highest."

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to see the reason behind Your humility,
and then ride on into my heart...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
