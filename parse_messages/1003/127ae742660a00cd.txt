Our Bible verses for Today:
He took the bread . . . and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body given
for you." . . . He took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in
my blood, which is poured out for you." (Lk. 22:19, 20)

Our Lesson for Today:
That Passover evening Jesus had plenty on His mind. Ahead of Him lay a night 
and a day packed with the worst men could ever invent. Who could have blamed 
Him if He had told those disciples to leave Him alone? But He didn't ! ! ! His love
for sinners wouldn't let Him. That love even moved Him to leave a parting gift for 
them, a blessed inheritance that would help them through the ages. . .

Looking at His disciple, then and now, He saw how they would need assurance of
sin forgiven, how often their wounded hearts would need special healing. So in love
He gave them a miracle. He left them the treasure of His Holy Supper, in which He 
gives His true body with the bread and His true blood with the wine so that penitent
sinners might be assured of forgiveness. . .

"Go in peace," He tells the penitent, "your sins are forgiven as surely as My body 
and blood prepared that forgiveness which you now have received." Now pray:

Prayer Suggestion:
Thank You God for Remembering me, help me remember
what a Savior I have and what He offers me in His meal...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
