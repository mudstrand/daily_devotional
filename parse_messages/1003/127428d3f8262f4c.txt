03/09/2010~~~food for thought~~~PRAISE FOR HIS NAME ~ THE LAMB...

Our Bible Verse for Today: (John the Baptist said:)
"Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin
of the world! (Jn. 1:29)

Our Lesson for Today: (A little O. T. history lesson)
Every morning and evening, a lamb was sacrificed in the temple 
for the sins of the people (Exodus 29:38-42). Isaiah 53:7 prophesied
that the Messiah, God's servant, would be led to the slaughter like a lamb...

(N. T. history lesson) To pay the penalty for sin, a life had to be given ~ 
and God chose to provide the sacrifice Himself. The sins of the world were 
removed when Jesus died as the perfect sacrifice. This is the way our sins 
are forgiven (I Cor. 5:7)...

The "sin of the world" means everyone's sin, the sin of each individual.
Jesus paid the price of your sin by His death. Yes you can receive forgiveness
by merely confessing your sin to Him and asking for His forgiveness...

Prayer Suggestion:
Thank You, Lord, for becoming the lamb and shedding Your 
blood for me. Forgive me for my sins of thought word and deed...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to The Father except through me." - John: 14:6
