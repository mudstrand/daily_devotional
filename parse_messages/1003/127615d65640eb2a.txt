03/15/2010~~~food for thought~~~PRAISE FOR HIS NAME ~ THE LIFE...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
I am...the life...No one can come to the Father except through me...(Jn. 14:6)

Our Lesson for Today:
Do you know CPR? ~ What about spiritual life? ~ How much do you know?
When Jesus said "I am the life," He was referring to spiritual life. He was
making the point that without Him, people are dead beyond the point of
resuscitation. True, many exist each day without Him. They walk and talk,
work and play, marry and bury, but as dead people. When God looks at 
them, He sees only spiritual corpses bound only for hell's bonfire...

No wonder Scripture describes hell as everlasting death. It's the dead end 
for souls that without the Savior can only be dead in unbelief. Only in Jesus 
am I alive because only in Him is sin's pardon and heaven's hope. As one
church father put it, "Without the Way, there is no going; without the Truth,
there is no knowing; without the life, there is no living."
What a name, the Life, my Savior-God has, one that deserves
my praise all my days...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, You've made me alive through faith.
Keep me alive till I reach heaven's door... Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
