03/02/2010~~~food for thought~~~LENT AND LOVE

Our Bible Verses for Today:
To Him who has loved us and freed us from our sins by His Blood . . .
to Him be glory and power for ever! Amen. (Rev. 1:5, 6)

Our Lesson for Today:
He "has freed us from our sins," John wrote. Lent is not only a time for 
the upward look at God's love but also for the inward look at our selves.

What do I see when I look at myself? ~ Is it someone worthy of God's
love ~ or is it someone with sin's dirt imbedded beneath the fingernails of
daily life? ~ Is it someone who's walk is squeaky clean ~ or whose mind, 
tongue, and actions look as though they've spent time in sin's mud holes?

The inward look quickly reminds me how amazing God's love is to reach so 
low to sinners like me...

What did it cost God to free me from my sins? ~ "Blood," John said. The cross
was no decoration or ornament for Jesus. It was filled with pain and smeared with 
His precious blood. Yes it's time to look up again and marvel at such love...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, fill me with thankfulness and awe each time
I hear the message of Your salvation...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
