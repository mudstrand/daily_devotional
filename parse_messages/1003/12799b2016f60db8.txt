03/26/2010~~~food for thought~~~OUR SHEPHERD KNOWS THE RIGHT PATH...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
He lets me rest in green meadows; He leads me beside peaceful streams.
He renews my strength. He guides me along right paths, bring honor to His
name...(Ps. 2, 3)

Our Lesson for Today:
When we allow God, our Shepherd, to guide us we will have contentment.
When we choose to sin and go our own way, we surely can not blame God 
for the predicaments we find ourselves in...

Our Shepherd knows the "green meadows" and "peaceful streams" that will
restore us. We can only reach these places by following Him obediently. Let
us remember this the next time we are tempted to go our own way rather than
the Shepherd's way...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to always keep my feet on the correct path,
the path that you have set for me...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
