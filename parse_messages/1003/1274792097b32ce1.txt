03/10/2010~~~food for thought~~~PRAISE FOR HIS NAME ~ KING

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Now the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,
be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen. (I Tim 1:17)

Our Lesson for Today:
Look at what my King brings. Earthly kings tax and take from their subjects...
Jesus only gives, even offering up Himself for me... Earthly rulers demand with
a heavy hand. Jesus offers with winsome love...Earthly rulers fill their coffers with
the coins of their people...Jesus, through His death, has prepared treasures in
heaven for me...

Yes He promises perfect care for all His subjects even me, and perfect peace for
our hearts. Already here on earth I am a citizen of His kingdom. My baptismal
certificate is proof on my citizen-ship. Just wait till in heaven I share with the eternal,
immortal King fully in His realm...

What a name, King My Savior-God has, one that deserves my praise all my days.

Prayer Suggestion:
Eternal God, thank you for coming as my King to make
me a citizen of heaven...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
