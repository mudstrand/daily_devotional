03/24/2010~~~food for thought~~~DEATH OF ONE MEANS LIFE FOR ALL...

Our Bible verses for Today:
Then he [Moses] took the Book of the Covenant and read it to the people.
they all responded again, "We will do everything the Lord has commanded.
We will obey...Then Moses sprinkled the blood from the basin over the people
and said, "This blood confirms the covenant the Lord has made with you in
giving you these laws." (Ex. 24:7, 8)

Our Lesson for Today:
To understand this unusual covenant ratification ceremony, we need to understand 
the Bible's view, [God's view] of sin and forgiveness. ~ God is the sovereign Judge 
of the universe. ~ He is also absolutely holy. ~ As the holy Judge of all, he condemns
sin and judges it worthy of death...

In the Old T. God accepted the death of an animal as a substitute for the sinner. The
animal's shed blood was proof that one life had to be given for another. ~ So on the
one hand, blood symbolized the death of an animal, but it also symbolized the life that 
was spared as a result. But of course this was only a temporary provision, looking
forward to the death of Jesus Christ...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I thank you for the sacrifice you made
on Calvary's Mountain for me...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
