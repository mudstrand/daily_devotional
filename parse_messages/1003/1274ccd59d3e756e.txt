03/11/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE FIRST AND LAST...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last,
the Beginning and the End...(Rev. 22:13)

Our Lesson for Today:
The book of Revelation calls Jesus "the Alpha and the Omega" four times.
We'd probably say "A and Z" Just as those two letters are the first and the
last in our alphabet, so Alpha and Omega are in the Greek...

Why is this a good name for Jesus? ~ First of all, because He's our Eternal Savior.
His salvation is forever. Nothing new will ever take it's place. Unlike our cars with new
models every year or our computers where hardware and software are obsolete
almost before we buy, Jesus' salvation stays the same...

There is no Savior before Him, nor any after Him. He truly is the First and the Last.
Jesus is all-sufficient, His salvation offers my soul all it ever needs. Nothing ever
has to be added. ~ no updated part will ever have to be attached. His words on
Calvary's cross, "It is finished," still mean that sin is canceled and salvation is
complete. Whether I call Him Alpha and Omega ~ or A and Z Jesus is all I'll
ever need...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, thank you for being my one and only,
all-sufficient Savior...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
