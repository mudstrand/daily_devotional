03/29/2010~~~food for thought~~~WHY THE NEED TO SHED BLOOD?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness...(Heb. 9:22f)

Our Lesson for Today:
Have you ever been asked or wondered, 'Why does forgiveness require the shedding of blood?'

Be sure of this, this is not some unreasonable decree on the part of a blood-thirsty God as some
have suggested.The answer to this age-old question is, there is no greater symbol of life than
blood, blood keeps us alive. Jesus shed His blood ~ gave His life ~ for our sins so that we wouldn't 
have to experience spiritual death, eternal separation from God...

Jesus is the source of life, not death. He gave His own life to pay our penalty for us so that we might 
live. After shedding His blood for us, Christ rose from the grave and proclaimed victory over sin and 
death...

Yes it is difficult to understand this kind of love and forgiveness ~ BUT oh how much better this world
would be if we too could live this kind of example...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, instill in me a Christ-like love...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
