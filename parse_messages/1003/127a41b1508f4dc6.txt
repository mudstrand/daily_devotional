03/28/2010~~~food for thought~~~A PLACE TO LIVE FOR ETERNITY...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
You prepare a feast for me in the presence of my enemies.
You welcome me as a guest, anointing my head with oil.
My cup overflows with blessings...

Surely Your goodness and unfailing love will pursue me all the
days of my life, and I will live in the house of the Lord forever...

Our Lesson for Today:
It is comforting to know that God offers us protection even when
enemies surround us. In the closing scene of this psalm, we also
see that believers are promised that they will live with God. Yes
God promises to guide and protect us throughout our life and to 
bring us into His house to live forever. 
IF WE WILL BUT ACCEPT HIS OFFER...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I thank You for Your protection and Your promise that
I will live in Your house forever...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
