03/22/2010~~~food for thought~~~SING PRAISES TO THE SAVIOR

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Hosanna to the Son of David! ~ Blessed is He who comes in the
name of the Lord! ~ Hosanna in the highest! ~(Mt. 21:9)

Our Lesson for Today:
Have you ever wondered what Jesus' thoughts were as He rode in
that Palm Sunday parade? ~ He had no false dreams about where 
His ride was taking Him. All the palm waving and hosanna shouting 
didn't fill Him with delusions of grandeur...

Earlier, on the way to the parade, He had told His disciples exactly
what lay ahead of Him. It surely was not the keys to the city, but a 
cross out side it. ~ But that cross would unlock the doors to the
heavenly Jerusalem...

With His crown of thorns and His throne of pain, He would pay for 
the world's sin. ~ From this Savior-King would come victory such as 
the world has never seen and will always need...

The more I see in this King, the one who came to die for my sins and
prepare eternal life for me in heaven, the more I will shout my hosannas 
to Him today, tomorrow, and in eternity...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, show me Your cross' victory over sin so
that I would shout hosanna all my days...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
