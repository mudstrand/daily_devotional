04/01/2010~~~food for thought~~~A WORD OF PROMISE...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
I tell you the truth, today you will be with Me in Paradise...(Lk. 23:43)

Our Lesson for Today:
As the criminal next to Jesus, draws is dying breath, he turned to Jesus and
said, "Remember me in Your Kingdom." This was his plea for forgiveness.
Yes, one may say it was to simple ~ but Jesus recognized the man's sincerity.
"Remember me," and Christ accepted him...

To me this says loud and clear ~ your deeds will not save you, but your faith
in Christ will. It is never to late to turn to God. Even in His misery, Jesus had 
mercy on this criminal who decided to believe in Him. Yes, Christ accepts us
in spite of our past. BUT our life will be much more useful and fulfilling if we
turn to God early, but even those who repent at the very last moment will be
with God in paradise...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, please, in Your mercy and grace, so promise me...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
