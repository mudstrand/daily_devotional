Our Bible Verse for Today:
Even when I walk through the dark valley of death, I will not be afraid, 
for You are close beside me. Your rod and Your staff protect and
comfort me...(Ps. 23:4)

Our Lesson for Today:
Death often is a frightening thing, because we are entirely helpless in its presence.
We can struggle with other enemies ~ pain, suffering, disease, injury ~ but strength
and courage cannot overcome death...

It has the final word...Only one person can walk us through death's dark valley
and bring us safely to the other side. He is the God of life, our Shepherd...

Because life is uncertain, we should follow this Shepherd who offers us eternal comfort...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord and Savior, lead me on to life eternal...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the Father except through me." John: 14:6
