Our Bible Verses for Today:
"The God of peace make you perfect in every good work to do His
will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in His sight, through
Jesus Christ." (Heb. 13:20~21)

Our Lesson for Today:

Here again I hope you have prepared your heart and strong faith to
take in one of those promises of God as high above all other thoughts
such as the heaven is above the earth...

We have a wonderful lesson in Hebrews of that eternal redemption 
which Christ our great High Priest, the Mediator of the new covenant,
worked out for us through the shedding of His precious blood...

The writer of this Epistle closes his whole argument and all its deep 
spiritual teachings with the benediction ~ "The God of peace" ~
now listen, Make you perfect in every good work to do His will."

Doesn't that include everything? Can we desire more? Yes, listen ~
"Working in you that which is well-pleasing in His sight," And 
that is through Jesus Christ...

Remember ~ the great thought here is that all that Christ had done for
our redemption and all that God had done in raising Him from the dead
was just with the one object that He might now have free scope for working
out in us that everlasting redemption which Christ had brought in...

If we want to know the way, we have The answer: "By His working within us
that which is well~pleasing in His sight. And that through Jesus Christ."

Prayer Suggestion:
Simply pray, "Lord, increase my faith."
