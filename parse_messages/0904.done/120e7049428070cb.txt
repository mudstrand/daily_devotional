My little pony 

Toy horses are usually pink and plastic and aimed at young girls.

But this little pony is 100 per cent natural and ready to make friends with anyone her size 

Born ten days ago at a stud in the southern state of Victoria , Australia , the 15in miniature horse which is yet to be named has already formed a bond with Sam Leith, 12.

Seeing eye to eye: The little horse has already formed a bond with youngster Sam Leith 
Going for a walk: Sam leads the way, followed by Bliss and her tiny new daughter 
Silver dun tovero in colour, she was given a clean bill of health and should reach 24in when grown.
The birth has generated such excitement in the community that local people are entering a competition to give the horse a name in time for Christmas.
Owner Lee Scown said she wanted a name that reflected the tiny, unique nature of the horse.
'Its the smallest horse Ive ever had and shes so gorgeous,' Ms Scown said. 


The miniature horse snuggles up to mummy as local people try to come up with a name for her 

The horse, currently only a little taller than this book, is expected to grow to about 24 inches 
'Its amazing to see a horse so tiny, and shes about the size of a week-old lamb.'
The horse is the smallest born at Riverdance and its arrival surprised even its breeder.
'We got told the mare wasn't due for another four weeks but on Sunday morning I walked outside and called her, and out ran the little foal behind her.'

Tight squeeze: The horse is so small it can fit underneath her mother
