become as never before the Mighty God.

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Ye believe in God, believe also in Me." (Jn 14:1)

Our Lesson for Today:

When Christ was about to leave His disciples, He taught them that they
were to believe in Him with the same perfect confidence which they had
in God...

"Ye believe in God, Believe also in Me." "Believe Me, that I am in the Father."
He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also."

Here on earth He had not been able to make Himself fully known to His
disciples. BUT in heaven the fullness of God's power would be His; and
He would, in and through His disciples, do greater things than He had ever 
done upon earth...

Dear Christian, don't you see of what deep importance it is that you take
time to worship Jesus in His Divine Omnipotence as one with the Father???

In doing so it will teach you to count on Him in His sufficiency to work in you
all that you can desire. This faith must so possess you that every thought of
Christ will be filled with the consciousness of His presence as an Almighty
Redeemer, able to save and sanctify and empower you to the very uttermost...

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray for a direct, definite, unceasing faith in His
mighty power to work in you, today...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
