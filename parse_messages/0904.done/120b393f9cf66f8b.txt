04/17/09~~~food for thought~~~By grace we have been saved, not by our works...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"In that day you shall know that I am in My Father,
and you in Me, and I in you." (Jn. 14:20)

Our Lesson for Today:

When Jesus spoke of His life in the Father "Believe Me that I am in the 
Father, and that the Father is in Me." He and the Father are not two 
persons to each other; they are in each other; though one on earth as 
man, He lived in the Father...

All He did was what the Father did in Him...

This Divine life of heaven, of Christ in God and God in Christ, is the picture 
and the pledge of what our life in Christ is to be here upon the earth. 
It is the very nature of the Divine life that the Son is in the Father...

Even so we must know and always live in the faith that we are in Christ. 
Then we shall learn that even as the Father worked in Christ, so Christ 
will also work in us if we but believe that we are in Him and yield ourselves 
to His power...

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray that the Lord would be please to pour down upon all His children
who are seeking to work for Him a Spirit of grace that we may not rest
until we too are filled with the Holy Spirit..
