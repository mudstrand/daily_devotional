04/16/09~~~food for thought~~~Christ wants first place in our heart.

Bible Verses for Today:
"If I go away, the Comforter will come unto you.
He shall glorify Me; for He shall take of Mine;
and shall declare it unto you." (Jn. 16:7, 14)

Our Lesson for Today:

The crucified Christ was to be glorified on the throne of heaven.
And out of that glory He would send down the Holy Spirit into
the hearts of His disciples to glorify Him in them...

Yes, the Spirit that searcheth the deep things of God, that dwells
in the very roots of the Divine Being, that had been with Christ
through all His life and in His death upon the cross, the Spirit of 
the Father and the Son was to come and dwell in them and make 
them the conscious possessor of the presence of the glorified Christ...

We too are to be led by the Spirit every day and every hour. In His
power our life is to be a direct and continual abiding in the love and
fellowship of Jesus...

Yes the promise waits for its fulfillment in our life: "He shall glorify
Me; for He shall take of Mine, and shall declare it unto you."

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord take my heart and cleanse it from all unrighteousness
so that my life and heart will be entirely under Your control...
