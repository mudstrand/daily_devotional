04/04/09~~~food for thought~~~We all say "Yes I believe!" But what does our obedience say?

Our Verses for Today:
The Lord appeared to Abraham. and said to him:
"I am God Almighty: Walk before Me, and be thou
perfect. And I will multiply thee exceedingly."
(Gen. 16:1-2)

Our Lesson for Today:

In Abraham we see how God not only asks for faith and rewards faith,
but also how He works faith by the gracious training that He gives...

When God first called Abraham, He at once gave the great promise,
"In thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed" (Gen. 12:3).

When he reached the land, God met him with the promise that the
land should be his (Gen. 12:7).

When Abraham returned from the battle against the kings, God again
met him to renew the promise (Gen. 5:15).

Before the birth of Isaac, in the words of our text, God is seeking to
strengthen his faith (Gen. 17).

And once more in the plains of Mamre, God Spoke: "Is anything to
hard for the Lord?" Step by step God led him until his faith was perfected
for full obedience in the sacrifice of Isaac. As "by faith Abraham obeyed
to go out," so by faith at the close of forty years he was able, without any 
promise, in fact in apparent conflict with all the promises, to obey God's will 
to the very end...

So, only can we go out like Abraham when we are called to a life of true
consecration to God and in the obedience of faith...

So let us walk in the foot steps of Abraham.
Let us hide deep in our heart the testimony of God's Word:
"He was strong in faith, giving glory to God; being fully
persuaded, that what He had promised, He was able to
perform."

Prayer Suggestion:
Lets pray that the Lord would teach us the power of faith and
all that He is willing to work in us who believe...
