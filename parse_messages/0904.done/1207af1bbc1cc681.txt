04/06/09~~~food for thought~~~In what have you placed your love...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with ALL thine heart, and with 
ALL thy soul and with ALL thy might" (Deut. 6:5)

Our Lesson for Today:
God taught Abraham what it was to believe in God with all his heart;
he was strong in faith, giving glory to God...

Moses taught Israel what the first great commandment was: 
to love God with all your heart. If we learn this commandment
all the others will naturally follow...

Through this Great Commandment our relationship with God as the
loving Creator and man made in His image will be the object of that love...

As Christians we should find our life, our destiny, and our happiness
in just one thing, loving God with all our heart and with all our strength.
Moses said: "The Lord has a delight in thy fathers, to love them." (Deut. 10:15)

Let us learn a double Lesson. This perfect heart, loving God with all our might, 
is what God claims, is what God is infinitely worthy of, is what God will Himself
give and work in us...

A Prayer Suggestion:
Let us pray that our whole soul go out in faith to meet - to wait for - and to
expect the fulfillment of the promise - to love God with the whole heart.
(This is what God Himself will work in us if we allow Him).
