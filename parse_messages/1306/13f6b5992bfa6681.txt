Today's Verse: 1 Cor. 2:9

"No eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined what God 

has prepared for those who love him." 

Today's Thoughts:

We can not begin to imagine all that God has in store for us, both in this
live

and eternity. He will create a new heaven and a new earth (Isa. 65:17;
Rev.21:1),

and we will live with Him forever-



Until then, His Holy Spirit comforts and guides us. Knowing the wonderful
and

eternal future that awaits us gives us hope and courage to press on in this
life,

to endure hardship, and to avoid giving in to temptation. . .



This world is not all there is. The Best is yet to come. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, regardless of the number of my days on earth, help me to always 

be prepared when You call me home. I know that the road of my life leads

finally to that Heavenly mansion You have prepared. Equip me for the trials 

and pitfalls that await me on my way through this life and teach me to
preform 

in Your holy name each duty which confronts me. Remind me each day that I

am but a pilgrim here and help me to assist my fellow travelers with their
burdens

showing the glory of the new life in You. . . Amen.





Ps. I'm sorry that you received only half a message earlier today
