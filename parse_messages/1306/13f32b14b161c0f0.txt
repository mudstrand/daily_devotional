Today's Verse: Luke 15:20
<http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Lk+15%3A20> 

He arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off,

his father saw him, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.



Today's Lesson:

In Luke 15:1-10 We have the story of the lost coin and the lost sheep-which
could not return

by themselves. In this parable the father watched and waited. He was dealing
with a human-being

with a will of his own, but he was ready to greet his son if he returned-



In the same way God's love is constant and patient and welcoming. He will
search for us and give

us opportunity to respond, but He will not force us to come to Him. . .Like
the father in this story

God waits patiently for us to come to our senses. . .



Prayer Suggestion:

I thank You for Your grace and mercies which are new every day.

I thank You for Your love and patience and Your willingness to 

welcome us back when we stray from You-so I pray forgive 

me Lord for my unfaithfulness. . .Amen.
