Today's Verse: Daniel 5:27
<http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Da+5%3A27> 

"Thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting." 

It is good to weigh ourselves in the scale of God's Word. You will find it a
holy exercise to read some psalm of David, and, as you meditate upon each
verse, to ask yourself, "Can I say this? Have I felt as David felt? Has my
heart ever been broken on account of sin, as his was when he penned his
penitent psalms? Do I take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of
the Lord?" Then turn to the life of Christ, and as you read, ask yourselves
how far you are conformed to His likeness. Seek to discover whether you have
the meekness, the humility, the lovely spirit which He constantly displayed.
Take then, the epistles, and see whether you can go with the apostle Paul in
what he said of his experience. Have you ever cried out as he did-"O
wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death"?
Have you seemed to yourself the chief of sinners, and less than the least of
all saints? Have you known anything of his devotion? Could you join with him
and say, "For me to live is Christ, and to die is gain"? If we read God's
Word as a test of our spiritual condition, we shall have good reason to stop
many times and say, "Lord, give me true penitence, give me real faith;
instill in me greater love; grant me the grace of meekness; make me more
like Jesus. Let me no longer be 'found wanting,' lest I be found wanting in
the scales of judgment." "Judge yourselves that ye be not judged."

Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, I confess that I need Your deliverance from sin. I need Your
Spirit's leading

and guidance in order that I might become more Christ like. . .Amen.
