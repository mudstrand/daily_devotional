Today's Verse: Isaiah 14:1 

1 But the Lord will have mercy on the descendants of Jacob. He will choose
Israel as His special people once again.

He will bring them back to settle once again in their own land. And people
from many different nations will come and 

join them there and unite with the people of Israel.



Toda's Thoughts:

A prominent theme in Isaiah is that non-Israelites would join the returning
Israelites. (Isa. 56:6, 7; 60:10; 61:15)

God's intention was that through His faithful people all the world would be
blest. . .



Through the family of David, the whole world could be saved by Christ. 

We must never limit God's love to our own people. God loves the whole world.




Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord Jesus, how great is Your mercy that You would have people to 

be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth! Keep me mindful of Your

command to "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature,"

so that people everywhere may come to know the truth of Your saving love. .
. Amen.
