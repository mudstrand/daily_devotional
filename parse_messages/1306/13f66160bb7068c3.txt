Today's Verse: 2 Cor. 5:17

Anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone;
a new life has begun! 

Today's Thoughts:

Christians are brand new people-on the inside.

The Holy Spirit gives them new life. And they are not the same anymore.




We are not reformed, rehabilitated, or reeducated, we are re-created (new
creations)

living in vital union with Christ (Col. 2:6, 7).



At conversion we do not merely turn over a new leaf we begin a new life
under a New Master.



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, I pray that I would become more sensitive to Your Holy Spirit's

guidance, that I would be dead to sin and alive to holiness. Use me today to

bring Your Gospel to some person who is as a sheep without a shepherd, so

that person may learn to know You-the Good Shepherd-and find in You 

rest and peace for his soul. . . Amen.
