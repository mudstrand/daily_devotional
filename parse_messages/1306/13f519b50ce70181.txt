Today's Verse: Psalm 27:1
<http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ps+27%3A1> 

"The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the
strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?" 



Today's Lesson:

"The Lord is my light and my salvation." Here is personal interest, "my
light," "my salvation"; the soul is assured of it, and therefore declares it
boldly. 

Into the soul at the new birth divine light is poured as the precursor of
salvation; where there is not enough light to reveal our own darkness and to
make 

us long for the Lord Jesus, there is no evidence of salvation. 

After conversion our God is our joy, comfort, guide, teacher, and in every
sense our light: He is light within, light around, light reflected from us, 

and light to be revealed to us.

Note, it is not said merely that the Lord gives light, but that He is light;
nor that He gives salvation, but that He is salvation; he, then, who by
faith has 

laid hold upon God, has all covenant blessings in his possession.

This being made sure as a fact, the argument drawn from it is put in the
form of a question, "Whom shall I fear?" A question which is its own answer.


The powers of darkness are not to be feared, for the Lord, our light,
destroys them; and the damnation of hell is not to be dreaded by us, for the
Lord is our salvation. 

This rests, not upon the conceited vigor of an arm of flesh, but upon the
real power of the omnipotent I AM. "The Lord is the strength of my life." 

We may well accumulate terms of praise where the Lord lavishes deeds of
grace. Our life derives all its strength from God; and if He deigns to make
us strong, 

we cannot be weakened by any evil plotting of the adversary. "Of whom shall
I be afraid?" The bold question looks into the future as well as the
present. 

"If God be for us," who can be against us, either now or in time to come?



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, I pray that you would keep me firm in the faith-watchful in
temptation-

humble in my success-and-joyful in the face of affliction, for without You,
I can

do nothing-but I can do all things through You who strengthens me. . .Amen.
