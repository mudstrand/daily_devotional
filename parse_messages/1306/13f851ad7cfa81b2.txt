Today's Verse: Psalms 55:17

Morning, noon, and night I cry out in my distress, and the Lord hears my
voice. 



Today's Thoughts:

Praying in this way is certainly an excellent way to maintain correct
priorities throughout every day.

Daniel followed this pattern (Dan. 6:10) and so did Peter (Acts 10:9-10).

The prayers of God's people are effective against the overwhelming evil in
the world. . .

Let us pray for our countries leaders, both federal, state, and local. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, I thank You for hearing my prayers, help me to be faithful in my
prayer life like Daniel and Peter.

I ask this for I know that I need Your Spirit's directive because of the
sinful times we are living in.

Be with those who are struggling with the different issues of this life,
whether it be financial-

physical-or domestic-lay Your hand of comfort on them and give them the
peace

that only You can give. I pray for godly wisdom for our countries leaders
in Jesus name. . . Amen.
