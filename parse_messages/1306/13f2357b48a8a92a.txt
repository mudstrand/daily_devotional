Today's Scripture: II Tim. 2:15
Work hard so you can present yourself to God and receive his approval. 
Be a good worker, one who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly 
explains the word of truth. 

Today's Lesson: 
Because God will examine what kind of workers we have been for Him,
we should build our life on His Word and build His Word into our life.
It alone tells us how we are to live for Him and serve Him. . .

Believers who ignore the Bible will certainly be ashamed at the judgment.
Consistent and diligent study of God's Word is vital other wise we will
be lured into neglecting God and our true purpose for living. . .

Suggested Prayer:
Dear Lord, Help me build Your Word into my life. I need Your guidance
each and every day. Help me to be sensitive to Your Holy Spirit leading
and guidance otherwise I will be tempted to neglect Your Word. . . Amen.
