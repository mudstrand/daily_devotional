Today's Verse: Psalm 37:4
<http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ps+37%3A4> 

"Delight thyself also in the Lord." 

Today's Lesson:

David tells us to take "delight" in the Lord, and commit everything we have
and do to Him. . .

But how do we do this? To delight in someone means to experience great
pleasure and

Joy in his or her presence. This only happens when we know them well. . .



So, to delight in the Lord, we must know Him better. Knowledge of God's
great love for

us will surely give us delight. . .



To commit ourselves to the Lord means entrusting everything-our lives,
families, job,

possessions-to His control and guidance. To commit to the Lord means to
trust in Him

(Ps. 37:5), believing that He can care for us better then we can for
ourselves. . .



We should be willing to wait patiently (Ps. 37:7), for Him to work out what
is best for us. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord I confess that at times I find myself doing what I do not want to
do,

and sometime not doing what I know I should do. For this I ask for Your
mercy.

send Your Holy Spirit into my heart that I may grow in grace and in the
knowledge 

of Jesus Christ, my Savior. Help me to grow in those things which are
pleasing to You. . . Amen.
