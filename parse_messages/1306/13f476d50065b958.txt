Today's Verse: Revelation 3:7
<http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Rev+3%3A7> "He openeth, and no
man shutteth." 

Today's Lesson:

Jesus is the keeper of the gates of paradise and before every believing soul
He places an open door, which no man or devil shall be able to close against
it. 

What joy it will be to find that faith in Him is the golden key to the
everlasting doors. Every believing soul, carries this key in his heart-what
are you trusting in? 

Have you allowed some deceitful lock-pick, to move in who will fail you at
last? 



Hear this parable of a great preacher who once lived, and remember it. The
Great King has made a banquet, and He has proclaimed to all the world that
none shall enter

but those who bring with them the fairest flower that blooms. The spirits of
men advance to the gate by thousands, and they bring each one the flower
which he esteems the queen of the garden; but in crowds they are driven from
the royal presence, and enter not into the festive halls. Some bear in their
hand the deadly nightshade of superstition, or the flaunting poppies of
Rome, or the hemlock of self- righteousness, but these are not dear to the
King, the bearers are shut out of the pearly gates. 

Have you gathered the rose of Sharon? Do you wear the lily of the valley in
your bosom constantly? If so, when you come up to the gates of heaven you
will know its value, for you have only to show this choicest of flowers, and
the Gate Keeper will open: not for a moment will He deny you admission, for
to that rose the Gate Keeper will open. 



You shall find your way with the rose of Sharon in your hand, up to the
throne of God Himself, for heaven itself possesses nothing that excels its
radiant beauty, 

and of all the flowers that bloom in paradise there is none that can rival
the lily of the valley. Dear soul, get Calvary's blood-red rose into your
hand by faith-

by love wear it-by communion preserve it-by daily watchfulness make it
yours-and you shall be blessed beyond all bliss-happy beyond a dream. 

May Jesus, be your Lord forever-your Key to heaven's gate.



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, may Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

Grant that Your will be done in the hearts and lives of people everywhere,

and grant me the grace to always be aware of Your will that I would submit

to it in all things. Give me faithfulness in my work, and crown my labors

with Your blessing. . . Amen.
