Today's Verse: Luke 6:37 (Jesus says)

"Do not judge others, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn others, 

or it will all come back against you. Forgive others, and you will be
forgiven 



Today's Thoughts:

A forgiving spirit demonstrates that a person has received God's
forgiveness.

If we are critical rather than compassionate, we will also receive
criticism.

If we treat others generously, graciously, and compassionately-these
qualities

will come back to us in full measure. . .



We are to love others-not judge them. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, grant me the opportunity today to do good to someone in need of
love.

Show me how to live in a manner worthy of Your holy name. . . Amen.
