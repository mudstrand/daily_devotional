Today's Verse: Ps. 97:10 

You who are lovers of the Lord, be haters of evil; He keeps the souls of His
saints; 

He takes them out of the hand of sinners.



Today's Lesson:

A sincere desire to please God will result in an alignment of your desires
with God's

desires-You will love what God loves-and hate what God hates-if you love the

Lord, you will hate evil.

If you do not despise the actions of people who take advantage of others-

if you admire people who only look out for themselves-or if you envy those 

who get ahead using any means to accomplish their ends-then your primary 

desire in life is not to please God. . .

Learn to love God's ways and hate evil in every form-not only the obvious

sins but also the socially acceptable. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord guide my footsteps by Your Word,

and make my heart sincere; let sin have no place

in my life, Lord, but keep my conscience clear. . . Amen.



Ps (please pray for the little congregation we have began here in this
apartment)
