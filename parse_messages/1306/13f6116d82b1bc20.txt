Today's Verse: Heb. 13:8

Jesus Christ is the same yesterday-today-and forever. . .



Today's Lesson:

Though human leaders have much to offer, we need to keep our eyes on-

Christ, our ultimate leader. Unlike any human leaders He will never change.

Christ has been and will be the same forever. In a changing world we can
trust

our unchanging Lord. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord I thank You for Your unchanging love and mercy. I pray that You

would look with tender mercy upon all those who are without the comfort

of Your Gospel. I pray that you would turn their hearts in repentant faith

toward Your Son, and cause Your Gospel of forgiveness to be proclaimed

to all who have not yet heard of Your great grace in Christ Jesus. . . Amen.
