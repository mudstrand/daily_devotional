Today's Verse: John 10:28
<http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jn+10%3A28> "And I give unto
them eternal life, and they shall never perish." 



Today's Lesson:

The Christian should never think or speak lightly of unbelief. For a child
of God to mistrust His love, His truth, His faithfulness, must be greatly
displeasing to Him. How can we ever grieve Him by doubting His upholding
grace?

Christian! it is contrary to every promise of God's precious Word that you
should ever be forgotten or left to perish. If it could be so, how could He
be true who has said, "Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should
not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I
never forget thee."

What were the value of that promise-"The mountains shall depart, and the
hills be removed; but My kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall
the covenant of My peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on
thee." 

Where were the truth of Christ's words-"I give unto My sheep eternal life;
and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of My
hand. My Father, which gave them Me, is greater than all; and no man is able
to pluck them out of My Father's hand." 

Where were the doctrines of grace? They would be all disproved if one child
of God should perish. Where is the truthfulness of God, His honor, His
power, His grace, His covenant, His oath, if any of those for
whom Christ has died, and who have put their trust in Him, should
nevertheless be cast away? Put away those unbelieving fears which so
dishonor God. 

Remember it is sinful to doubt His Word where He has promised that you shall
never perish. Let the eternal life within you express itself in confident
joy.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, remove from me any and all doubts that may arise today

That may dishonor You. I pray that You would forgive me for all such
thoughts. . . Amen.
