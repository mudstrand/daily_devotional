VERSE FOR 3/14/2019:

_We do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with _

_our weakness, _(Heb. 4:15)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

Jesus knew what it was like to lose His personal space in the

commotion of crowds desperate to see and touch Him.A woman

who had suffered from constant bleeding for 12 years and could

not find a cure touched the fringe of His robe and was healed

immediately. Jesus felt the power come out of Him. While

some of us wish to keep our personal space and privacy, the

only way to help a world of hurting people is to let them get close

enough to be touched by encouragement, comfort, and the grace

of Christ in us.A CHRISTIAN'S LIFE IS THE WINDOW THROUGH WHICH

OTHERS CAN SEE JESUS.
