09/07/2010~~~food for thought~~~A FOUNTAIN OF BLESSING

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"The water I give him will become in him a spring of water
welling up to eternal life." (Jn. 4:14b)

Our Lesson for Today:
The picture our Lord described here is not that of a simple stream of water,
but an overflowing fountain. Continue to "be filled" (Eph. 5:18) and the sweetness
of your vital relationship to Jesus will flow as generously out of you as it has
been given to you. . .

If you find that His life is not spring up as it should, you are to blame ~ something
is obstructing the flow. Was Jesus saying to stay focused on the Source so that
you may be blessed personally? ? ? No, you are to focus on the Source so that
out of you "will flow rivers of living water" ~ irrepressible life (Jn. 7:38).

We are to be fountains through which Jesus can flow as "rivers of living water"
in blessing to everyone. Have you become like the Dead Sea, always receiving
but never giving, because your relationship is not right with the Lord Jesus?
Then here is a,

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, instill a new heart within me today so that
my relationship with You will be renewed andso that 
"rivers of living water" may flow out of me. . .Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
