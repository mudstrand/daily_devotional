09/22/2010~~~food for thought~~~IS HE TRULY YOUR MASTER? ? ?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Jesus says, "You call Me Teacher and Lord, and you say well,
for so I am. . . . I say to you, a servant is not greater than his 
master. . ." (Jn. 13:13, 16)

Our Lesson for Today:
Do you call Him Teacher and Lord? ~ But is He? ~ Teacher, Master, and 
Lord seem to have a very small place in our vocabulary. We seem to prefer 
the words Savior, Sanctifier, and Healer.

The only word that truly describes the experience of being mastered is love
and we seem to know very little about love as God reveals it in His Word. The
way we use the word obey is proof of this. . .

In the Bible, obedience is based on a relationship between equals; for example,
that of a son with his father. Our Lord was not simply God's servant - He was God's 
Son. ". . .though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience. . ." (Heb. 5:8)

He wants us in a relationship where He is so easily our Mater and Teacher that we
have no conscious awareness of it - a relationship where all we know is that we are
His to obey. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to walk in a relationship with You
that is pleasing to You. . .Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
