09/18/2010~~~food for thought~~~HIS TEMPTATION AND OURS

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"We do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weakness,
but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin" (Heb. 4:15). . .

Our Lesson for Today:
Temptation means, a test of possessions held within the inner, spiritual part
of our being by a power outside us and foreign to us. . .

This makes the temptation of our Lord explainable, After Jesus' baptism, having
accepted His mission of being the One "who takes away the sin of the world" 
(Jn. 1:29) He "was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness" (Mt. 4:1) and into the
testing devices of the devil. Yet He did not become weary or exhausted. . .

He went through the temptations "without sinning" and He retained all the possessions
of His Spiritual nature completely intact. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I pray that You would keep me unshaved
by temptation. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
