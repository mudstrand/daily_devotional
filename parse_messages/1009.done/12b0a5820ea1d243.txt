09/13/2010~~~food for thought~~~AFTER SURRENDER THEN WHAT

Our Bible;e Verse for Today:
I have brought You glory on earth by completing the work You
gave Me to do. . . (Jn. 17:4)

Our Lesson for Today:
True surrender is not simply surrender of our external life but surrender
of our will ~ and once that is done, surrender is complete. The greatest 
crisis we will ever face is the surrender of our will. . .

Yet God never forces a person's will to surrender, and He never begs.
He patiently waits until that person willingly yields to Him. And once that
battle has been fought, it never needs to be fought again. . .

In (Mt. 11:28) Jesus gives this invitation "Come to Me. . ." The accepting
of this invitation is a voluntary coming. . . Remember He is waiting will
you accept His invitation today?

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, by Your Holy Spirits work, help me to surrender
my will to You, so that my name will be written into the Lamb's
book of life. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
