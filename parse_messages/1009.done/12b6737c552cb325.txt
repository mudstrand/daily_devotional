10/01/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE PLACE OF EXALTATION

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Jesus took Peter, James, and John to the top of the mountain.
(Mk. 9:2a)

Our Lesson for Today:
I believe we have all experienced times of exaltation on the mountain, when we have
seen things from God's perspective and have wanted to stay there. But God will
never allow us to stay there. ~ The true test of our spiritual life is in exhibiting the
power to descend from the mountain. . .

If we only have the power to go up, something is wrong. It is a wonderful thing to
be on the mountain with God, but a person only gets there so that he may later go 
down and lift up the people in the valley (see 9:14-18).

We are not made for the mountains, for sunrises, or for the other beautiful attractions
in life ~ those are simply intended to be moments of inspiration. We are made for
the valley and the ordinary things of life, and that is where we have to prove our stamina 
and strength. Yet our spiritual selfishness always wants repeated moments on the mountain.

I think we feel that we could talk and live like perfect angels, if we could only stay on the 
mountaintop. . . Those times of exaltation are exceptional and they have their meaning in 
our life with God, But we must beware to prevent our spiritual selfishness from wanting
to make them the only time. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I do thank You for the mountaintop experiences,
but I do know that the valley type experiences are also good
for me because they help me to grow in my faith for You. . . Amen.

No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
