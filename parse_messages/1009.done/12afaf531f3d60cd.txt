09/10/2010~~~food for thought~~~YOU CAN NOT HIDE WHAT YOU ARE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"How do you know about me?" Nathanael asked.
Jesus replied, "I could see you under the fig tree
before Philip found you." (Jn. 1:48)

Our Lesson for Today:
Yes Jesus knew about Nathanael before the two ever met.
Jesus also knows what we are like. . . 

An honest person will feel comfortable with the thought that 
Jesus knows him or her through and through. A dishonest 
person will feel uncomfortable. . .

You can not pretend to be something you're not. God knows 
the real you and wants you to follow Him. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I thank You for the invitation to follow You even 
though you know me through and through. Please forgive 
me of the sins I have committed, know and unknown. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
