09/25/2010~~~food for thought~~~ONLY BY GOD'S GRACE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles." (Mt. 5:41)

Our Lesson for Today:
IF we are disciples of Jesus, we must be made disciples supernaturally.
And as long as we consciously maintain the determined purpose to be His 
disciples, we can be sure that we are not His disciples. . .

Jesus says, "You did not choose Me, but I chose you. . ." (Jn. 15:16)
That is the way the grace of God begins. It is a constraint we can never escape;
we can disobey it, but we can never start it or produce it ourselves. . .

We are drawn to God by a work of His supernatural grace, and we can never trace 
back to find where it began. Our Lord's making of a disciple is supernatural. . .
He does not build on any natural capacity of ours at all. . .

You may have noticed that God does not ask us to do the things that are naturally
easy for us ~ He only asks us to do the things that we are perfectly fit to do 
through His grace and that is where the cross we must bear will always come. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I pray that today through Your grace I may
become obedient to Your will. . .Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
