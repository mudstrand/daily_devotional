09/23/2010~~~food for thought~~~STAYING TRUE TO THE COURSE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Gathering the twelve disciples around Him, Jesus told them,
"as you know, we are going to Jerusalem. . . (Lk.18:31a)

Our Lesson for Today:
In our Lord's life, Jerusalem was the place where He would reach the end
of God's plan for all of mankind through His Son's death on the cross, and 
unless we go there with Him, we will have no friendship or fellowship with
Him. . .

Nothing ever diverted our Lord on His way to Jerusalem. He never hurried
through certain villages where He was persecuted, or lingered in others where 
He was blessed. . . Neither gratitude nor ingratitude turned our Lord even in 
the slightest degree away form His purpose to go "up to Jerusalem."

As Jesus' followers we will not end in crucifixion; BUT by the Lord's grace we 
will end up in glory. In the meantime our watch word should be summed up by
each of us saying, "I too go 'up to Jerusalem. ' " 

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me stay true to the course, 
You have set for me. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
