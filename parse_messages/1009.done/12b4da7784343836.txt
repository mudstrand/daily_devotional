09/27/2010~~~food for thought~~~MAKING SURE OF OUR PROMISES

Our Bible Verse for Today:
". . .someone said to Him, 'Lord I will follow You wherever
You go' (Lk. 9:57).

Our Lesson for Today:
Our Lord's attitude toward this man was one of severe discouragement,
"for He knew what was in man" (Jn. 2:25). I'm pretty sure that many of us 
would have said, "I can't imagine why He lost the opportunity of winning that 
man! Imagine being so cold to him and turning him away so discouraged!"

Let us never apologize for our Lord. The words of the Lord hurt and offend 
until there is nothing left to be hurt of offended. . . Jesus Christ had no tenderness
whatsoever toward anything that was ultimately going to ruin a person in his
service to God. . .Our Lord's answers were not based on some whim or impulsive 
thought, but on the knowledge of "what was in the man."

If the Spirit of God brings to your mind a word of the Lord that hurts you, you
can be sure that there is something in you that He wants to hurt to the point of death.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, make me aware of the things in my life that
are a hindrance to serving you as I should. . . Amen. 
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
