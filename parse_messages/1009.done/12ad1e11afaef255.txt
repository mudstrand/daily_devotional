09/02/2010~~~food for thought~~~A LIFE OF PURE AND HOLY SACRIFICE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Whoever believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water
will flow from within him. . . (Jn. 7:37)

Our Lesson for Today:
Jesus did not say, "He who believes in Me will realize all the blessings
of the fullness of God," but, in essence, "He who believes in Me will
have everything he receives escape out of him."

Our Lord's teaching was always anti-self-realization. His purpose is 
not the development of a person ~ His purpose is to make a person
exactly like Himself, and the Son of God is characterized by self-expenditure.

Remember, if we believe in Jesus, it is not what we gain but what He
pours through us that really counts~ ~ ~ Now is the time to stop seeking
our own satisfaction, and to pour out our lives before Him. Our Lord is
asking who of us will do it for Him. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, take my life and let it be ~ 
consecrated Lord to Thee. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
