Our Bible Verse for Today:
I am glad when I suffer for you in my body, for I am completing what remains
of Christ's suffering for His body the church. . .(Col. 1:24)

Our Lesson for Today:
When Paul says, "I am completing what remains of Christ's sufferings," he does
not mean that Christ's suffering was inadequate to save him, nor does he mean
that there is a predetermined amount of suffering that must be paid by all believers.

What Paul is says is there could be an unavoidable suffering to bring the Good News 
of Christ to the world. It is called 'Christ's suffering' because all Christians are related
to Christ. . . When we suffer Christ feels it with us. . .

But this suffering can be endured joyfully because it changes lives and brings people
into God's Kingdom. (See I Pet. 4:1, 2; 12-19)

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, my prayer once again is for the help to remain faithful
no matter what the consequences. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
