09/16/2010~~~food for thought~~~PRAYING IN SECRET

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Jesus says: "When you pray, go into your room and close the
door, and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father,
who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. . . (Mt. 6:6)

Our Lesson for Today:
The main thought in the area of religion is ~ Keep your eyes on 
God, not on people. Our motivation should not be the desire to
be known as a praying person. . .

Find an inner room in which to pray, where no one even knows you
are praying, shut the door, and talk to God in secret. . .

We should have no other motivation than to know our Father in
heaven. . . It is impossible to carry on your life as a disciple
without definite times of secret prayer. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, the Father of all mercy help me to remember to
draw near to You each day in a time of prayer. . .Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
