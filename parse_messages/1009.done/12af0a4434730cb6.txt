Our Bible verse for Today: (Here we have Paul's defense of his ministry.)
We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up
against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought
to make it obedient to Christ. . . (II Cor. 10:5)

Our Lesson for Today:
We, like Paul, are merely weak humans, but we don't need to use human 
plans and methods to win our battles. God's mighty weapons are available 
to us as we fight against the Devil's "strongholds."

A Christian must choose whose methods to use, God's or the worlds.
Paul's assures us that God's mighty weapons ~ prayer, faith, hope, love,
God's Word, the Holy Spirit, are powerful and effective (see Eph. 6:13-18).

These weapons can break down the proud human arguments against God
and the walls that Satan builds to keep people from finding God. . . When 
dealing with people's proud arguments that keep them from a relationship
with God, we may be tempted to use our own methods. but nothing can
break down these barriers like God's weapons. . . 

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, Help me to remember, that the best way to win
my battles is by using Your weapons. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
