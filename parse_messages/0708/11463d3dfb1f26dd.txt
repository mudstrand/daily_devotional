GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Our only righteousness is in Christ, who died 
and rose again in our stead...

Our Meditation for Today:

Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have
peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ...(Ro. 5:1, 2) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

We now have peace with God, which, may be different from
peaceful feelings such as calmness...

Peace with God means that we have been reconciled with Him.
There is no more hostility between us, no sin blocking our 
relationship with Him...

Peace with God is possible only because Jesus paid the price
for our sins through His death on the cross...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for another day, 
I thank You for the gift of salvation that is mine through 
Jesus' death on the cross. I pray for Your divine forgiveness
for my sins of though, word and deed...Amen.

Keep looking up, if God brings you to it, 
He will bring you through it...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
