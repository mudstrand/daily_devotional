GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~"Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputes
no iniquity" Ps. 32:2

Our Meditation for Today:

Hope, does not disappoint us, because God has poured out 
His love into our hearts by His Holy Spirit, whom He has 
given us...

You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless,
Christ died for the ungodly...(Ro. 5:5, 6) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

We need to take note here that all three members of the Trinity
are involved in salvation...

The Father loved us so much that He sent His Son to bridge
the gap between us (Jn. 3:16).

The Father and the Son send the Holy Spirit to fill our life with
love and to enable us to live by His power (Acts 1:8).

With all this loving care, how can we do less than serve Him
completely!!!

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, I thank You for Your grace, mercy and love.
I pray that my love for You and my neighbor would grow
in like manner. Forgive me for not having a Christ-like love.
I pray this in Jesus name...Amen.

Keep looking up, there will be showers of blessing...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
