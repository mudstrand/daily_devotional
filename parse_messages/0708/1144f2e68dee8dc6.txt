GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Faith is always the requisite for obtaining the
true benefits of God's Word...

Our Meditation for Today:

It is not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received 
the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the
righteousness that comes by faith...

For if those who live by the law are heirs, faith has no value and
the promise is worthless, 

because law brings wrath, and where there is no law there is
no transgression...(Ro. 4:13-15) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Paul uses these O.T. references to show that humanity in general,
in its present sinful condition, is unacceptable before God...

Have you ever thought to yourself, "Well, I'm not to bad. I'm a
pretty good person?

Look at verses 10-18 and see if any of them apply to you. 
Have you ever lied? Have you ever hurt someone's feelings by your
words or tone of voice? Are you bitter toward anyone? Do you
become angry with those who strongly disagree with you? 

In thought, word, and deed, you like everyone else in the world, stand
guilty before God...We must remember who we are in His sight--
alienated sinners...

Don't deny that you are a sinner...Instead, allow your desperate need
to point you toward God...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, at one time or another I have been guilty of
all of these sins. Forgive me of my sins of thought, word, and deed.
Guide me in the paths of righteousness I pray in Jesus name...Amen.

Keep looking up, if God brings you to it,
He will bring you through it...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
