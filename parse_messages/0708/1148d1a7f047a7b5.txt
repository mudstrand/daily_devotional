GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~We cannot blame Adam for sin in the world 
because all men have sinned.

Our meditation for Today:

Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, 
and death through sin, and in this way death came to all 
men, because all sinned. (Ro. 5:12) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

How can we be declared guilty for something Adam did thousands
of years ago? Many feel it isn't fair for God to judge us because of
Adam's sin...

But let us not forget each of us confirms our heritage with Adam by
our own sins every day. We have the same sinful nature and are
prone to rebel against God, and we are judged for the sins WE commit.

Because we are sinners, it isn't fairness we need, It is mercy...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I know that I am a sinner and 
in need of forgiveness, so I come pleading for mercy.
I also pray for safety for our nation it's citizens and it's
troops. Be with the families who are grieving the lose 
of a family member in the mine accidents that have
taken place in the last few weeks...Amen.

You're in the prayers of two who care...
Keep looking up, we all need His mercy...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
