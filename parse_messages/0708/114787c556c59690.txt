GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~As long as there is a "today" all ills can be resolved...

Our Meditation for Today:

God demonstrates His own love for us in this:
While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. (Ro. 5:8) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

"While we were still sinners" these are amazing words.
God sent Jesus Christ to die for us, not because we were 
good enough, but just because He loved us...

When ever you feel uncertain about God's love for you,
remember that He loved you even before you turned to Him...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your
awesome love for me, help me to demonstrate
a Christ-like love for all people, even those who
attempt to do me harm...Amen.

Keep looking up, it is in Him that all things are possible...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
