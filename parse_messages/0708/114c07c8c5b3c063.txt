GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~We can praise God for eternal forgiveness...

Our Meditation for Today:

For we know that our old self was crucified with Him
so that the body of sin might be done away with, that
we should no longer be slaves to sin--

Because anyone who has died is freed from sin. (Ro. 6:6, 7) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

The power of sin over us died with Christ on the cross. Our "old sinful selves," 
our sinful nature, died once and for all, so we are freed from its power...

The "power of sin' refers to our rebellious sin-loving nature inherited from Adam. 
Though we often willingly cooperate with our sinful nature, it is not us but the sin 
in us that is evil.

AND it is this power of sin at work in our life that has been defeated. Paul has 
already stated that through faith in Christ we stand acquitted, "not guilty" before
God.

Here Paul emphasizes that we need no longer live under sin's power...

In our old life we were slaves to sin, now we can chose to live for Christ...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, There are times I find myself sinning
but I thank You for, forgiving me of those sins and I seek Your
forgiveness again today for those sins. Cleanse my heart from
all unrighteousness Amen...

Keep looking up, He is due to return any day...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
