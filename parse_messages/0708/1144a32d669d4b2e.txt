GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Abraham was 99 years old when he was circumcised (Gen. 17:24)

Our Meditation for Today:

Under what circumstances was it credited? was it after he
was circumcised or before? It was not after, but before!

And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the 
righteousness that he had by faith while He was still 
uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe 
but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness 
might be credited to them...

And he is also the father of the circumcised who not only 
are circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the 
faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised...
(Ro 3:10-12) NIV

Our Thought for Today:
Rituals did not earn any reward for Abraham, he had been blessed long 
before the circumcision ceremony was introduced...

Abraham found favor with God by faith alone, before he was circumcised...
Gen. 12:1-3 tells of God's call to Abraham when he was seventy five years 
old.

The circumcision ceremony was introduced when he was 99 (Gen. 17:1-4).

Ceremonies and rituals serve as reminders of our faith as well as instruct
new or young believers...BUT we should not think that they give us any 
special merit before God...

They are meant to be outward signs and seals that demonstrate inner
belief and trust. The focus of our faith should be on Christ and His saving 
work not on our own actions...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that my faith would clearly 
demonstrate my inner belief and trust in You. Help me
to be a better witness of Your love and mercy...Amen.

Keep looking up, and God will bring you through it...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
