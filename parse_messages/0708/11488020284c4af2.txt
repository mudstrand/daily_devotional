GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~We can rejoice in God because we are His and He is ours...

Our Meditation for Today:

In our last devo. vs. 10 we were told: "For if when we were
God's enemies we were reconciled through the death of 
His Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall
we be saved through His life!"

Now in today's verse we are told:

Not only is this so, but we also rejoice in God through our
Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received
reconciliation...(Ro 5:11) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

What we need to realize first of all is that God is holy, and
He will not be associated with sin...

All people are sinful and so they are separated from God.
In addition all sin deserves punishment. But instead of punishing
us with the death we deserve, Christ took our sins upon Himself
and took our punishment by dying on the cross...

SO now we can rejoice in God. Through faith in Christ's work, 
we become close to God (friends) rather than being enemies
and out casts...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for another day in
which I ask for Your sustaining power, love, and mercy.
I have to confess that no matter how hard I try to live
a righteous life I still fall short and am in need of forgiveness.
Deliver me from my offenses I pray in Jesus name...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will deliver you...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
