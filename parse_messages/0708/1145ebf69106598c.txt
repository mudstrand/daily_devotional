GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Christ's death and resurrection, brought forth an eternal grace.

Our Meditation for Today:

The words "it was credited to him" were written not for
Abraham alone,

but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness,
for us who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord
from the dead...

He was delivered over to death for our sins and raised 
to life for our justification...(Ro. 4:23-25) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

When we accept Jesus Christ as our Savior, an exchange
takes place. We give Him our sins, and He forgives us and
makes us right with God...(see 2 Cor. 5:21)

There is nothing we can do to earn this. Only through Christ
can we be made right in God's eyes...

What an incredible bargain this is for us! But sadly, many still
choose to pass up this gift to continue "enjoying" their sin.

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the gift of grace,
the gift of forgiveness for my sins through faith in the 
finished work of Christ on the cross. I lay my sins at the
foot of the cross expecting total forgiveness...Amen.

Keep looking up, God will take your hand...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
