GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~We should be driven to seek our salvation only in Christ's atonement...

Our Meditation for Today:

The Law was added so that the trespass might increase.
But where sin increased, grace increased all the more,

so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might
reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through
Jesus Christ our Lord...(Ro. 5:20, 21) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

As sinners separated from God, we see His law from below,
as a ladder to be climbed to get to God...

Perhaps you have repeatedly tried to climb it, only to fall to
the ground every time you have advanced one or two rungs...

Or perhaps the sheer height of the ladder seems so over-
whelming that you have never even started up...

In either case, what a relief you should feel to see Jesus 
offering with open arms to lift you above the ladder of the 
law, to take you directly to God!!!

Once Jesus lifts you into God's presence, you are free to 
obey--out of love, not necessity, and through God's power,
not your own...

You know that if you stumble, you will not fall back to the ground.
Instead, you will be caught and held in Christ's loving arms...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the salvation 
You have provided through Jesus Christ, so that I
no longer have to strive to attain perfection before I
can be assured of eternal life...Amen.

Keep looking up, Jesus has taken care of the work of atonement...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
