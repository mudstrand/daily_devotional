GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~God's love and provision of grace includes all mankind...

Our Meditation for Today:

For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through
the one man, how much more will those who receive God's 
abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness
reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ...(Ro 5:17) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

What a promise this is to those who love Christ!

We can triumph over sin's power and death's
threats through the power of Jesus Christ...

Lets also look at Ro. 8:17:
Now if we are His children, then we are heirs,
heirs of God and co-heirs of Christ, if indeed 
we share in His sufferings in order that we may
share in His glory...

There is a price for being identified with Christ,
but also there is a great treasure...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your grace 
and mercy. Help me to be sensitive and obedient
to Your Holy Spirit's leading...I pray that You would
keep our nation, its citizens, and our troops safe.
Watch over my e-mail friends...Amen.

Keep looking up, He has a plan for your life...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
