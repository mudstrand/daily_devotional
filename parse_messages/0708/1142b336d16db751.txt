GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Faith is never perfect. So believers must pray for
forgiveness for their weak faith...

Our Meditation for Today:

When people work, their wages are not a gift. 
Workers earn what they receive...

But people are declared righteous because of 
their faith, not because of their work...(Ro. 4:4, 5) NLT

Our Thought for Today:

What vs. 4 means, is that if a person could earn right standing 
with God by being good, the granting of that gift wouldn't be a 
free act; it would be an obligation...

When some people learn that they are saved by God through faith
they start to worry. "Do I have enough faith?" They wonder, "Is my
faith strong enough to save me?"

These people miss the point. It is Jesus Christ who save us, not our 
feelings or actions, and He is strong enough to save us no matter how 
weak our faith is...

Jesus offers us salvation as a gift because He loves us, not because 
we have earned it through the power of faith...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You that my salvation does not depend
upon my works because they are no more than filthy rags...Amen.

Keep looking up, and you shall receive showers of blessings...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather...
