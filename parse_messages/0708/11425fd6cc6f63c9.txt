GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~All of man's works for merits are but opposites
to the free gift of the grace of God. (Eph. 2:8, 9)

Our Meditation for Today:

What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, discovered
in this matter?

If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to 
boast about--but not before God...

What does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was 
credited to him as righteousness." (Ro. 4:1-3) NIV

Our Thoughts for Today:

The Jews were proud to be called children of Abraham...

Really Paul uses Abraham as a good example of someone
who was save by faith. (Abraham believed in God)...

By emphasizing faith, Paul is not saying that God's law is not 
important (Ro 4:13) but that it is impossible to be saved simply
by obeying it...

Let us not look to our good works as a way to inherit eternal life.

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, open my eyes that I might see glimpses 
of truth you have for me. Sensitize my heart and spirit to Your
Holy Spirit's leading that I might be obedient to Your word...Amen.

Keep looking up, for His guidance...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
