Today's Verses: Ps. 37:25-27

Once I was young, and now I am old. Yet I have never seen the godly
abandoned or their children begging for bread.

26 The godly always give generous loans to others, and their children are a
blessing. 
27 Turn from evil and do good, and you will live in the land forever. 

Today's Thoughts:

Because there are starving children today, as there were in David's day-what
did David mean by these words?

"The children of the righteous need not go hungry because other believers
should help them in their time of need."

In David's day, Israel obeyed God's laws, which ensured that the poor were
treated fairly and mercifully.

As long as Israel was obedient, there was enough food for everyone.

When Israel forgot God, the rich took care of themselves only, and the poor
suffered.



When we see a Christian brother or sister suffering today, we can respond in
one of three ways.

(1) We can say, as Job's friends did-that the afflicted person brought this
on himself.

(2) We can say, this is a test to help the person develop more patience and
trust in God.

(3) We can help the person in need. David would approve of only the last
option.

Although many governments today have their own programs for helping those in
need-

this is no excuse for ignoring the poor and needy within our reach. . . 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord Jesus,, by the gift of Your Holy Spirit, make possible in me a
loving heart

So that I would reach out to the poor and needy-that I may keep your
commandments, 

abiding in Your love. I give thee thanks. . . Amen.
