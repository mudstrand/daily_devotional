Today's Verses: Ps. 37:22-24

Those the Lord blesses will possess the land, but those he curses will die. 
23 The Lord directs the steps of the godly. He delights in every detail of
their lives.

24 Though they stumble, they will never fall, for the Lord holds them by the
hand. 

Today's Thoughts:

The person in whom God delights is one who follows God, trusts in Him, and
tries to do His will.

God watches over and makes every step firm that a faithful person takes. If
you would like to have 

God direct your way, then seek His advice before you step out. 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, I believe that You, who are able to do all things
above all that I ask or think, 

are able and willing by the power of Your Holy Spirit to strengthen me for
this life, as I walk in the 

light of Your love. . . Amen.

"For the Lord is good and His love endures forver;

His faithfulness continues through all generations."
