What is in store for the New Year?



More of the same-that's what life seems like to many of us.

Though some may have new experiences and excitement this

new year-life for many of us will be one day strung behind the

other with the same tasks hovering before our eyes and the same

troubles settling on our shoulders. It doesn't make much difference

what number we write for the year.



Thank God one thing never changes. Would we want a Lord who 

changes His mind and issues a recall for promises He made yesterday?

A Lord who forgets His full payment for all our sins and now demands 

that we cover sin's debt? A Lord who closes the door to heaven He 

once opened with His resurrection? More of the same! YES that's 

what we need and that's what we have in the Savior Jesus Christ, who 

"Is the same yesterday and today and forever." Heb. 13:8



Pastor Al and Marcie Sather

Let us be transformed by the renewing of our mind. Ro. 12:2



My prayer is that you will have a Happy and Safe New Year.
