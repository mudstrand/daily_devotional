Today's Verses: Ps. 37:16, 17

16 It is better to be godly and have little than to be evil and rich.

17 For the strength of the wicked will be shattered, but the Lord takes care
of the godly. 

Today's Thoughts: 

Our attitudes can color our whole personality. We can-not always choose what
happens 

to us, but we can choose our attitude toward each situation. The secret to a
happy heart 

is filling our mind with thoughts that are true, pure, and lovely, with
thoughts that dwell 

on the good things of life (Phil. 4:8). Maybe its time to look at your
attitude and then 

examine what you allow to enter into your mind and what you choose to dwell
on. 

You may need to make some changes.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, awaken my heart when I need an attitude adjustment-for surely I
need your help.

Be with those who are dealing with health issues-in Jesus name. . . Amen.

If anyone is ashamed of Me-the Son of Man will be ashamed 

of him when He comes in His Fathers glory with the holy angels.

(Mk. 8:38)
