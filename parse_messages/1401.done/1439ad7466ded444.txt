Today's Verses: Ps. 37:21-22

The wicked borrow and never repay, but the godly are generous givers.

22 Those the Lord blesses will possess the land, but those he curses will
die. 

Today's Thoughts:

You can tell a lot about a person's character by the way he/she handles
money.

The wicked person steals under the guise of borrowing-or charging with no 

intension of paying their bill. The righteous person gives generously to the
needy.

But the wicked person focuses on himself, while the righteous person looks
to the 

welfare of others.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, every year the chasm of our nation and you widens. People continue
to defy 

Your laws, and deny Your name in an endeavor to even remove any remembrance 

of You. We thank You Lord, for giving us the victory through Jesus Christ. .
. Amen.



Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all

Your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.

(Mk. 12:30)
