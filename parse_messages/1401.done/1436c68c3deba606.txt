Today's Verse: Ps. 36:1

Sin whispers to the wicked, deep within their hearts. They have no fear of
God at all. 

Today's Thoughts:

Because the wicked have no fear of God, nothing restrains them from sinning-

They charge ahead as if nothing will happen to them. But God is just and is 

only delaying their punishment. This knowledge should hold us back from 

sinning. Let the fear of God do its work in you to keep you from sin. 

If you have any gratitude for God's love, don't ignore His justice. 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, with all the blessings I have received through out my life,

I cannot be anything but thankful. Thankful for Your love and mercy

Thankful for my family and friends, thankful for the country I live in.

Shower them with Your blessings today I pray in Jesus name.Amen.
