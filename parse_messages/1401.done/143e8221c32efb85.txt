Today's Verses: Ps. 39:1-3

I said to myself, "I will watch what I do and not sin in what I say. 

I will hold my tongue when the ungodly are around me."

2 But as I stood there in silence- not even speaking of good things- 

the turmoil within me grew worse.

3 The more I thought about it, the hotter I got, igniting a fire of words: 

Today's Thoughts:

David resolved to keep his tongue from sin, that is, he decided not to 

complain to other people about God's treatment of him. All though 

David did have a reason to complain. David was the anointed king of 

Israel, but he had to wait many years before taking the throne. Then 

one of his sons tried to kill him and become king instead. When David 

could not keep still any longer, he took his complaints directly to God. 



We may all have complaints about our job, or money, or situation, but 

complaining to others may make them think that God cannot take care 

of us. It may also look as if we blame God for our troubles. Instead, like 

David, we should take our complaints directly to God.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, I ask that You would forgive me for complaining about the little
things of 

life when there are so many things I should really be thanking You for, like
my health, 

home, family, friends, the freedom of worship-the freedom of speech-the list
could 

go on and on. For these things I do truly thank You. . . Amen.
