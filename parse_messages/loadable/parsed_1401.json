Like spring flowers, they soon\nwither. \n3 Trust in the Lord and do good. Then you will live safely in the land and\nprosper. \n\nToday's Thoughts:\n\nWe should never envy evil people, even though some maybe extremely popular \n\nor excessively rich. No matter how much they have, it will fade and vanish\nlike \n\ngrass that withers and dies. Those who follow God live differently from the\nwicked, \n\nand in the end, will have treasures in heaven. What an unbeliever gets on\nearth may \n\nlast a life time, but what you get from God lasts forever. . .\n\nToday's Prayer Suggestion:\n\nO Lord, I thank You, for the fact that You are the same yesterday today and\nforever.\n\nI thank You, that the promises You have made are the same from ever-lasting\nto ever-lasting. . .Amen.\n\n\n\nPastor Alvin and Marcie Sather\n\nPut on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.

David was the anointed king of Israel, but he had to wait many years before taking the throne. Then one of his sons tried to kill him and become king instead. When David could not keep still any longer, he took his complaints directly to God. We may all have complaints about our job, or money, or situation, but complaining to others may make them think that God cannot take care of us. It may also look as if we blame God for our troubles.
