    "verse": "Paul writes: I myself am convinced, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, complete in knowledge and competent to instruct one another. I have written you quite boldly on some points, as if to remind you of them again, because of the grace God gave me to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles with the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit. Therefore I glorify in Christ Jesus in my service to God. (Romans 15:14-17) NIV",
    "reflection": "We see here that Paul was very enthusiastic about what God had done through him. Being proud of God's God work is not a sin ~ it is worship.
