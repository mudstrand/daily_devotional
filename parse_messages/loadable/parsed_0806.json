    "verse": "And now, brothers, we want you to know about the grace that God has given the Macedonian churches. Out of the most severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity. For I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own, They urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints. And they did not do as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us in keeping with God's will. (2 Corinthians 8:1-5) NIV",
    "reflection": "During Paul's third missionary journey, he had collected money for the impoverished believers in Jerusalem. The churches in Macedonia ~ Philippic ~ Thessalonian, and Berea had given money even though they were poor, and they had given sacrificially more than Paul had expected. Although they were poor themselves, they wanted to help. The amount we give is not as important as why and how we give. God does not want us to give grudgingly. Instead, He wants us to give as these churches did, out of dedication to Christ ~ love for fellow believers ~ the joy of helping those in need ~ as well as the fact that it was simply the good and right thing to do. How well does your giving measure up to the standards set by the Macedonian churches?",
    "prayer": "Dear Heavenly Father, Forgive me for looking only at the things I do not have, but help me to see all the blessings I have received. Give me a heart of compassion and a love to share what I have with those in need. Amen.",
