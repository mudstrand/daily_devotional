For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous. Indeed when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law, since they show that the requirements of the law are written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.

    "verse": "Can we boast, then, that we have done anything to be accepted by God? No, because our acquittal is not based on our good deeds. It is based on faith. So we are made right with God through faith and not by obeying the law. (John 3:27-28) NLT",
    "reflection": "Many religions require specific duties that must be performed to make a person acceptable to a god. Christianity is unique in that no good deed that we do will make us right with God. No amount of human achievement or personal goodness will close the gap between God's moral perfection and our imperfect daily performance. Good deeds are important, but they will not earn us eternal life. We are saved only by trusting in what God has done for us. (see Ephesians 2:8-10)",
    "prayer": "Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You that we have the assurance of eternal life with You through faith, which is also a gift from You. Help me Lord to grow in my faith I pray in Jesus name. Amen.",
