It is the Lord who judges me. Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait till the Lord comes. He will bring light on what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men's hearts. At that time each will receive his praise from God.\" (I Corinthians 4:3-5)",
    "reflection": "It is tempting to judge fellow Christians, evaluating whether or not they are good followers of Christ. But only God knows a person's heart, and He is the only one with the right to judge. Paul's warning to the Corinthians should also warn us. We are to confront those who are sinning (see. Corinthians 5:12, 13), but we need to remember we must not judge who is a better servant of Christ. When you judge someone you are really considering yourself as better, and that is an arrogant assumption.",

But He doesn't mean that all those who have indulged in sexual sin or who have been idol worshipers, adulterers, male prostitutes, homosexuals, thieves, greedy people, drunkards, abusers, and swindlers are automatically and irrevocably excluded from heaven. Christians come out of all different kinds of back grounds including these. they may even still struggle with evil desires, but they should not continue in these practices. In 6:11 Paul clearly states that even those who sin in these ways can have their lives changed by Christ. However, those who say that they are Christians but persist in these practices with no sign of remorse will not inherit the Kingdom of God. Such people need to reevaluate their lives to see if they truly believe in Christ.",

    "reflection": "The ceremony of circumcision was an important part of the Jews' relationship with God. In fact, before Christ came, circumcision was commanded by God for those who claimed to follow Him (Genesis 17:9-14). But after Christ's death, circumcision was no longer necessary (Romans 4:9-11). Pleasing God and obeying Him are more important than observing traditional ceremonies.",
    "prayer": "Dear Heavenly Father forgive me for not being as obedient as You would like, forgive me for falling short of Your requirements. I pray that You would help me become more obedient. Amen.",

Don't let it trouble you ~ although if you can gain your freedom, do so, , , For he who was a slave when he was called by the Lord is the Lord's freeman; similarly, he who was a freeman when he was called is Christ's slave.

Paul said that even though they were slaves to other human beings, they were free from the power of sin in their lives. People today are slaves to sin until they commit their lives to Christ, who alone can conquer sin's power. Sin pride, and fear no longer have any claim on us, just as a slave owner no longer has power over the slave he has sold. The Bible tells us we become Christ's slaves when we become Christians, but this actually mean we gain our freedom, because sin no longer controls us.",
