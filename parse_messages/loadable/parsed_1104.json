    "reflection": "The true atheist is either foolish or wicked ~ foolish because he ignores that God exists ~ or wicked because he refuses to live by God's truths. The truth of the matter is we all become atheists in practice when we rely more on ourselves than on God. ~ The fool mentioned here is someone who is aggressively perverse in his actions. To speak in direct defiance of God is utterly foolish according to the Bible.",
    "prayer": "Dear Lord Jesus, when we despair because of the world's increasing hostility or indifference to you, help us also to see the greatness of your love and grace. Amen.",
