Or though the Bible doesn't actually use the word, how would you explain the concept of the Trinity? Now what about the word forgive? The people of Jesus' day thought they understood what this word meant until they saw Jesus in action. Like the time when He was dinning at the house of Simon the Pharisee. While they were at the table, a woman with a sinful reputation slipped into the room. She washed Jesus' feet with her tears, dried them with her hair, and anointed them with expensive oil. She was kneeling at the feet of her Savior. With her actions she was showing how much His forgivingness meant to her. Of course Simon objected thinking Jesus should have sent her away. But Jesus doesn't treat people the way we do. He doesn't just show love to those He thinks deserve it. He offers His forgiveness to all. He gives it to sinners, not because they deserve it but because they need it. His love reaches out to all people, even me. I don't deserve even an ounce of it. Jesus' forgiveness brings me joy, even though I can't begin to understand the love behind it.",

If we buy the right vehicle, use the right cosmetics,\nand use the right medicines, the smile on our faces would stretch \nfrom ear to ear...\n\nIf we were to believe the news media, we wouldn't have any happiness\nat all. We see tragedy in all parts of the world and mishaps in our own \nlittle corner of the world that makes the pursuit of happiness useless...\n\nBut God's Word tells us that true happiness is attainable. It comes from\nsomething a gracious Lord has already given us. In Christ Jesus God \nhas prepared for me deliverance for all my sins. In Jesus He has shown \nme His saving heart, revealed His loving face, and indicated His desire to\nhave me with Him in heaven...\n\nHow is this happiness possible, It results when God brings us to faith in\nJesus, but it is something we can't produce or buy. It's a by-product of \nwhat God has already given us...\n\nGod promises that He will never count my sins against me because He has\nmade Jesus pay for them all. Those who live in God's forgiving love have\nhappiness in life that no storm cloud can darken or tornado sweep away...\n\nPrayer Suggestion:\nDear Lord, fill my days with the happiness of knowing\nYou have forgiven my sins in Jesus...Amen.\n\nPastor Al & Marcie Sather",

When the only Savior of the sinner stands at the door of our life, it won't work to say \"Just a minute while I pack.\" The suddenness of His coming will make the split second of an accident or the surprise of the first labor pain seem hours long in comparison. All at once He'll be at our door. We need to be ready before He comes, or we'll never be ready when He does come. Now when our heart still beats and our world still turns, is packing time for eternity. So what do we need in our suit case? What should we not forget? Only one item ~ Christ Jesus, the all sufficient Savior.\"Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, Scripture reminds us in (Acts 16:31). This requires constant packing. We need regular use of the gospel in Word and sacrament for the Holy Spirit to keep the Savior packed in our heart. No we can't pack it once and set it in the closet. This Advent season when to Savior gives you a poke in ribs, \"I'm coming, \" He is reminding you, \"Is your bag packed for heaven?\"",
