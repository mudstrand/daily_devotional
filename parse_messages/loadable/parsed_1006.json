Whenever Paul felt lost, \nHe would return to the beginning of his spiritual life, remembering\nthat he had already been freed by Jesus Christ...\n\nWhen we feel confused and overwhelmed by sin's appeal, we need\nto follow Paul's example. Thank God that He has given us freedom\nthrough Jesus Christ...\n\nToday let the reality of Christ's power lift you up to real victory over sin...\n\nPrayer Suggestion:\nDear Lord, forgive me when my sinful flesh wins.\nStrengthen me for my walk as Your child...Amen.\nPastor Alvin & Marcie Sather\n\nThe Lord said, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life. \nNo one can come to he father except through me.\" - John: 14:6",
