    "reflection": "I think we would all agree that here again we see the mystery of God's love revealed. The book of Hebrews links God's saving power with His creative power. In other words, the power that brought the universe into being and that keeps it operating is the very power that cleanses our sins. How mistaken we would be to ever think that God couldn't forgive us. No sin is the big for the Ruler of the universe to handle. He can and will forgive us when we come to Him through His Son. Through His Love we witness grace upon grace. My you truly experience the Mystery of His love for you. .",
    "prayer": "Christmas changes everything. It did 2000 years ago when the Word first became flesh, and it does each year--if we open ourselves to the mystery, the longing and the power of that event in the Bethlehem stable. Oh Lord make me sensitive once again as in the days of my childhood to the Mystery of You Love. Amen.",

    "verse": "He also says, \"In the beginning, O Lord, You laid the foundations of the earth,and the heavens are the work of Your hands. They will perish, but You remain; they will all wear out like a garment. You will roll them up like a robe; like a garment they will be changed. But You remain the same, and Your years will never end\". (Hebrews 1:10-12) NIV",
    "reflection": "The author here has just quoted Psalms 102:25-27. When he speaks of the earth and the heavens rolled up like a garment, he is revealing that the earth is not permanent or indestructible. Jesus' authority is established over all of creation, so we dare not treat any created objects or earthly resources as more important than He is. So as we are coming to the close of 2006 let us resolve to put God first in our life.",
    "prayer": "Dear Lord, I have not lived this past year as I should have, often times I have put people and things ahead of You; forgive me Lord for my sin, and create in me a pure heart. Protect our troops in the coming days. Amen.",
