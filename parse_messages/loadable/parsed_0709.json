In the Roman culture, the adopted person lost all\nrights to his old family and gained all the rights of a legitimate\nchild in his new family...\n\nHe became a full heir to his new father's estate...\n\nIt is the same for a new believer, he or she gains all the\nprivileges and responsibilities of a child in God's family...\n\nOne of these outstanding privileges is being led by the \nSpirit (see Gal. 4:5, 6).\n\nWe may not always feel like we belong to God, but the Holy Spirit\nis our witness. His inward presence reminds us of who we are and\nencourages us with God's love (Ro. 5:5)...\n\nOur Prayer for Today:\nDear Heavenly Father, I thank You for what is mine through\nmy personal relationship with You.
