The world rejoiced while the disciples wept, but the disciple would see Jesus again (in three days) and rejoice. The world's values are often the opposite of God's values.

His death and resurrection would strike the deathblow to \nSatan's rule and would establish Jesus' eternal authority over the earth...\n\nFew people reading the sign that bleak afternoon understood it's real meaning,\nbut the sign was absolutely true...\n\nAll was not lost. Jesus was King of the Jews, and the Gentiles, and of the \nwhole world...Have you accepted Him as your king???\n\nOur Prayer for Today:\n\nDear Heavenly Father, It is hard to phantom the kind of love You showed\nthe day You took my place on the cross...May my love for You be evident\neach and every day...Amen.\n\nKeep looking up and keep plugging away for Jesus...\nYou're in the Prayers of two who care...\nPastor Al & Marcie Sather",

Now we can freely approach God because of what Jesus did for us. Those who believe in Jesus' death and resurrection can live eternally with God and escape the penalty that comes from sin. If you have not as of yet personally accepted what Christ did for you on the cross, you could be playing Russian Roulette with your life.

Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down. The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other. But when they came to Jesus and found that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. (John 19:31-33) NIV",
    "reflection": "It was against God's law to leave the body of a dead person exposed overnight (see Deut. 21:23), and it was also against the law to work after Sundown on Friday, when the Sabbath began. This is why the religious leaders urgently wanted to get Jesus' body down off the cross and buried by sundown. Now these Roman soldiers had lots of experience from many previous crucifixions, so they knew when a man was dead or alive. So they did not need to break His legs. The reason for the breaking of the legs was so they could not hold themselves up, because when they could no longer hold themselves up death came by suffocation in just minutes. Jesus went through this ordeal so that our sins would be paid in full--That is why He said \"It is finished.\" There was no longer any need for the sacrifice of animals or anything else. Jesus' shed blood was sufficient for all time.",
