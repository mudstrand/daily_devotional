In the pleasure in eating and drinking, in the love and enjoyment of what there is to be seen of its glory, and in all that constitutes the pride of life. the power of this world proves itself. Most Christians are either utterly ignorant of the danger of a worldly spirit or feel themselves utterly powerless to conquer it. But Christ has left us a great promise: \"Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.\" So take the time to ask yourself whether you believe with your whole heart in the victory that faith gives over the world.

But it seems that all do not appear to consider that the very last command, not to preach until they had received the power from on high is equally binding on us as it was on the disciples. The Church appears to have lost possession of that which ought to be to her a secret of secrets ~ the abiding consciousness, day by day, that it is only as she lives in the power of the Holy Spirit that she can preach the Gospel in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.

Lets remember they were simple, unlearned men with many faults, but whom the Lord had called to forsake all and follow Him. And oh yes we must also remember, They had done this, as far as they could: they followed Him in the life He led and the work He did. Oh yes like us there was much sin in them and they had as yet no power to fully deny themselves, but at the same time their hearts clung to Him in deep sincerity. Even in the midst of much stumbling they still followed Him to the cross. They shared with Him His death; unconsciously but most really, they died with Him to sin and were raised with Him in the power of new life.

Your special ability may seem small it may even be large, but it is yours to use in God's service.

Like the disciple, we need to pray with others for that courage. To gain boldness, you can (1) pray for the power of the Holy Spirit to give you courage, (2) look for opportunities in your family and neighborhood to talk about Christ, (3) realize that rejection, social discomfort, and embarrassment are not necessarily persecution, and (4) start where you are by being bolder in small ways. Satin would have us to be all entangled with the things of the world, so that he can draw our attention away from the things of God. Oh yes differences of opinion are inevitable among human personalities and at times can actually be helpful if handled well.

It will need time\nand thought and love to realize what is included in that simple\nexpression...\n\nThink of your own neighborhood and all the saints you know; think\nof our whole country and praise God for all who are His saints;\nthink of all Christian nations of the world and the saints to be found\nin each of these;\n\nthink of all the heathen nations and the saints of God to be found\namong them in ever-increasing numbers.\n\nThink of all the different circumstances and conditions in which\nthese are to be found and all the varying needs which call for God's \ngrace and help.\n\nThink of the many, oh, so many, who are God's saints and yet through\nignorance or sloth, through worldly-mindedness or an evil heart of\nunbelief are walking in the dark and bringing no honor to God.\n\nThink of so many who are in earnest and yet conscious of a life of failure,\nwith little or no power to please God or to bless man. And then think again \nof those who are found everywhere, in solitary places or in companies,\nwhose one aim is to serve the Lord who bought them to be the light of \nthose around them...\n\nThis is not the work of one day or one night. It needs a heart which will\nset itself from time to time to do serious thinking in regard to the state\nand the need of the body of Christ to which we all belong...\n\nPrayer Suggestion:\nPray daily for the love of God and Christ to fill our hearts ~ and ~\nfor the power of the Holy Spirit to come down and accomplish\nHis work in this sinful world...\n\nPastor Al & Marcie Sather",

    "reflection": "There are many Christians who are afraid of the thoughts of a promise to pray every day as being far beyond their capability. They feel that they could not uphold this promise ~ but yet they pray to God to give them their bread day by day. If the children of God once yielded themselves with their whole lives to God's love and service, they should count it a privilege to avail themselves of any invitation that would help them every day to come into God's Presence with the great need of His Church and Kingdom. Are there not many who confess that they desire to live wholly for God? Are there not many who acknowledge that Christ gave Himself for them? Are there not many who say that In His love He watches over them and works in them without ceasing? And aren't there many that admit that nothing less than the measure of the love of Christ to us should be the measure of our love to Him? Don't they also feel that this ought to be the standard of their life? If this be true, shouldn't they welcome every opportunity for proving day by day that they are devoting their heart's strength to the interest of Christ's Kingdom and to the prayer that can bring down God's blessing? To those who have to confess that they have not totally understood the high privilege and the solemn duty of waiting on God in prayer for His blessing on the world should now welcome the invitation.",

We need to thank God, for we know of the tens of thousands of His children who in daily prayer are pleading for some portion of the work of God's kingdom in which they are personally interested. But in many cases there is a lack of that large-hearted and universal love that takes up all the saints of God and their service into His embrace. There is not the boldness and the strength that comes from the consciousness of being part of a large and conquering army under the leadership of our conquering King. The thought to remember is: The power of each individual member is increased to a large degree by the inspiration of fellowship with a large and conquering host. Nothing can help us to an ever-larger faith as the consciousness of being one body and one spirit in Christ Jesus.",
