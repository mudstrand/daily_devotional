He knew from experience what it meant to wait for the Lord. He had been anoint king at the age of 16 but did not become king until he was 30. During the interim he was chased through the wilderness by jealous King Saul. David had to wait on God for the fulfillment of his promise to reign. After becoming king he was chased by his rebellious son Absalom. Often it seems that God isn't answering our prayers or doesn't understand the urgency of our situation. That kind of thinking implies that God is not in control or is not fair. BUT God is worth waiting for.
