So this weak brother, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge. When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.

Some actions may be perfectly alright for us to do but may harm a Christian brother or sister who is still young in the faith and learning what the Christian life is all about. We need to be careful not to offend a sensitive or younger Christian or, by example, cause him or her to sin. When we love others, our freedom should be less important to us than strengthening the faith of a brother or sister in Christ.",

If the Lord's\nSupper becomes just a ritual or a pious habit, it no longer celebrates\nChrist's death, and loses its significance...\n\nWe should examine ourselves for any unconfused sins or resentful\nattitude (grudges) before we come to the Lord's table...If we have not\nwe eat and drink condemnation unto ourselves...\n\nOur Prayer for Today:\nDear Lord I pray that you would bring to mind any unconfused \nsin before I partake of the Lord's Supper. Cleanse me from all \nunrighteousness...Amen.\n\nKeep looking up, and He will bring to mind your need of confession...\nYou are in the prayers of two who care...\nPastor Al & Marcie Sather",

    "verse": "(one over lap from yesterdays Dev. ) If anyone eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord unworthily, that person is guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. That is why you should examine yourselves before eating the bread and drinking from the cup. For if you eat the bread or drink the cup unworthily, not honoring the body of Christ, you are eating and drinking God's judgment on yourself. That is why many of you are weak and sick and some have died. (I Corinthians 11:27-30) NLT",
    "reflection": "When Paul said that no one should take the Lord's Supper unworthily, he was speaking to the church members who were participating in it without thinking of its meaning. Those who did and still do are \"guilty of sinning against the body and the blood of the Lord.\" Instead of honoring His sacrifice, we are sharing in the guilt of those who crucified Christ. In reality, no one is worthy to take the Lord's Supper ~ We are all sinners saved by grace. This is why we should prepare ourselves for Communion through healthy Introspection, confession of sin, and a true resolution of differences with others. These actions remove the barriers that affect our relationship with Christ and with other believers. Awareness of your sins should not keep you away from the Communion table but drive you to confess and then drive you to participate.",
    "prayer": "Dear Heavenly Father, help me to examine myself totally each time I come to Your table that I might not sin against You. Wash me white as snow. Amen.",
