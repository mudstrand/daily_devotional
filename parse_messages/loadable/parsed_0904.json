In this verse we see that God undertook the work of making a creature, who is not God, but to be a perfect likeness of Him in His divine glory. (how do you measure up?) Man was to live in entire dependence on God and to receive directly and unceasingly from God Himself the overflow of all that is holy and blessed in the Divine Being. (are you living up the God's requirements?) God' glory, His holiness, and His love were to dwell in man and shine out through him. (not doing so well are you?) Well don't fret, your not alone, neither am I or anyone else for that matter. After sin had done its terrible work, it spoiled the image of God. But a promise was given in Paradise that the seed of a woman would bring forth the Divine purpose, \"God's Son\" He would become a Son of Man, in whom God's plan would be carried out, His image in human form. Now between the eternal purpose and its eternal realization, we have a wonderful promise in regard to our life here on earth.\"We all, beholding the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord\".

    "verse": "he Lord appeared to Abraham. and said to him: \"I am God Almighty: Walk before Me, and be thou perfect. And I will multiply thee exceedingly.\" (Gen. 16:1-2)",
    "reflection": "In Abraham we see how God not only asks for faith and rewards faith, but also how He works faith by the gracious training that He gives. When God first called Abraham, He at once gave the great promise, \"In thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed\" (Gen. 12:3). When he reached the land, God met him with the promise that the land should be his (Gen. 12:7). When Abraham returned from the battle against the kings, God again met him to renew the promise (Gen. 5:15). Before the birth of Isaac, in the words of our text, God is seeking to strengthen his faith (Gen. 17). And once more in the plains of Mamre, God Spoke: \"Is anything to hard for the Lord?\" Step by step God led him until his faith was perfected for full obedience in the sacrifice of Isaac. As \"by faith Abraham obeyed to go out, \" so by faith at the close of forty years he was able, without any promise, in fact in apparent conflict with all the promises, to obey God's will to the very end. So, only can we go out like Abraham when we are called to a life of true consecration to God and in the obedience of faith. So let us walk in the foot steps of Abraham. Let us hide deep in our heart the testimony of God's Word: \"He was strong in faith, giving glory to God; being fully persuaded, that what He had promised, He was able to perform.\"",

    "reflection": "In studding the promises Jesus gave His disciples in the last night, a possible question arises, What was it that made just these men fit and worthy of the high honor of being baptized with the Holy Spirit from heaven? The answer is simple. When Christ called them, they forsook all and followed Him. They denied themselves, even to the hating of their own life, and gave themselves to obey His commands. They followed Him to Calvary, and amid its suffering and death their hearts clung to Him alone. It was this that prepared them for receiving a share in His resurrection life and so become fit here on earth to be filled with the Spirit, even as He received the fullness of the Spirit from the Father in glory. So Paul says, \"I count all things as loss for Christ.\" So it must be with us too in order to share fully in the power of His resurrection.
