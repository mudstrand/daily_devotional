    "reflection": "The leading priests and teachers of religious law were well aware of Micah 5:2 and other prophecies about the Messiah. The astrologers' news trouble Herod because he knew that the Jewish people expected the Messiah to come soon we see this in (Luke 3:15). Most of the Jews expected the Messiah to be a great military and political deliverer, Like Alexander the Great. Herod's counselors would have told Herod this. No wonder this ruthless man took no chances and ordered all the Baby boys of Bethlehem killed.

Christ paid the price for \nsin and opened the way to peace with God. He offers us more than temporary\npolitical or physical changes - He offers us new hearts that will last for eternity.\n\n\"In the highest.\" Refers to praise in the heavenly realms, where God and the \nangels live. \"on earth peace.\" Emphasizes not human good will but God's grace \nand the peace it brings us.\n\nPrayer Suggestion:\nDear Lord, I thank you for the new heart that was made possible\nto me through Christ's coming to earth.
