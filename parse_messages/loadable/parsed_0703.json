It calms the mind...\n\nOur Meditation for Today:\n\nIf we deliberately keep on sinning after we have \nreceived the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice\nfor sins is left...(Heb. 10:26) NIV\n\nOur Thought for Today:\n\nWhen people deliberately reject Christ's offer of salvation,\nthey reject God's most precious gift. They ignore the leading \nof the Holy Spirit, the one who communicates to us God's \nsaving love...\n\nThis warning was given to Jewish Christians who were tempted\nto reject Christ for Judaism, but it applies to anyone who rejects \nChrist for another religion, OR, having understood Christ's atoning \nwork, deliberately turns away from it...\n\nThe point is there is no other acceptable sacrifice for sin than the \ndeath of Christ on the cross. If someone deliberately rejects the \nsacrifice of Christ after clearly understanding the Good News\nteaching about it, then there is no way for that person to be saved,\nbecause God has not provided any other name in all of heaven for \nthe people to call on to save them (Acts 4:12).\n\nOur Prayer for Today:\nDear Lord, I thank You for the atoning work of Christ.\nI thank You for the Good News of salvation. Thy Word \nis a lamp onto my feet and a light onto my path...Amen.\n\nKeep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...\nYou're in the prayers of two who care...\nPastor Al & Marcie Sather",

    "verse": "By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future. By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff. (Hebrews 11:20, 21) NIV",
    "reflection": "Jacob was Isaac's son and Abraham's grandson. Jacob's sons became the fathers of Israel's 12 tribes. Even when Jacob (also called \"Israel\") was dying in a strange land, he believed the promise that Abraham's descendants would be like the sand on the seashore and that Israel would become a great nation. True faith helps us see beyond the grave. True faith brings us to a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.",
    "prayer": "Dear Lord, I thank You for the promises that we find in Your Word. Help me Lord, to hold fast to those promises as Jacob held fast to the promise His grandfather Abraham had received. Bless our troops with good health and safety. Amen.",

    "reflection": "Joseph, one of Jacob's sons, was sold into slavery by his jealous brothers (Genesis 37). Eventually, Joseph was sold again, this time to an official of the Pharaoh of Egypt. Because of Joseph's faithfulness to God, he was given the top-ranking position in Egypt. Although Joseph could have used that position to build a personal empire, he remembered God's promise to Abraham. After he had been reconciled to his brother, Joseph brought his family to be near him and requested that his bones be taken to the Promised Land when the Jews eventually left Egypt. Our lesson is that, faith means trusting God and doing what He wants, regardless of the circumstances or consequences.",

As a parent, have you trusted God enough to take care of your children?
