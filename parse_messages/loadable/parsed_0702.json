If the Jewish priests and their laws had been able to save people, why would God need to send Christ as a priest, who came not from the tribe of Levi (the priestly tribe) but from the tribe of Juda? The animal sacrifices had to be repeated, and they offered only temporary forgiveness; but Christ's sacrifice was offered once, and it offers total and permanent forgiveness. Under the new covenant, the levitical priesthood was canceled in favor of Christ's role as High Priest. Because Christ is our High Priest, we need to pay attention to Him. No minister, no leader, or Christian friend can substitute for Christ's work and for His role in our Salvation.",

By Jesus' blood alone (1) We have our conscience cleansed, (2) We are freed from death's sting and can live to serve God, and (3) We are freed from sin's power. If you are carrying a load of guilt because you are finding that you can't be good enough for God, take another look at Jesus' death and what it means to you. Christ can heal your conscience and deliver you from the frustration of trying to earn God's favor.",
    "prayer": "Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for what Christ's shed blood means in my life. I thank You for removing the guilt of my sins. I thank You for the healing power that comes from Christ, since Christ came into my life. Amen.",

    "verse": "The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so they are outwardly clean. How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself unblemished to God, cleanse our conscience from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God. (Hebrews 9:13, 14) NIV",
    "reflection": "When the people sacrificed animals, God considered the people's faith and obedience, cleansed them from sin, and made them ceremonially acceptable according to the Old Testament law. But Christ's sacrifice transforms our life and heart and makes us clean on the inside. His sacrifice was infinitely more effective than animal sacrifices. No barrier of sin or weakness on our part can stifle His forgiveness.",
    "prayer": "Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the cleansing power of the blood of Jesus Christ. I thank You for the plan of salvation that was made available through the death of Your Son Jesus Christ. Accept my plea for the forgiveness of my many sins. Amen.",
