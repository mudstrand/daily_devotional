    "verse": "So whether you eat or drink or what ever you do, do it all for the glory of God. (I Cor. 10:31)",
    "reflection": "It is important that we show glory and honor to God through our life, not just through words or spiritual acts. Start seeing ordinary daily routines as something done for God, not just something to check off your list so you can search for God amidst things you think are holy. All of life is holy if lived unto the Lord. Remember Col. 3:23 teaches us to work heartily at every task, for the Lord and not for men. God assigns us the ordinary things of life as well as spiritual things like prayer, Bible study, and good works. He tells us throughout His Word to work, pay bills, take care of our homes and bodies, fellowship with other believers, enjoy our food, rest and laugh. Dividing the sacred from the secular causes us to live disjointed lives where we always rush through the things we see as mundane in order to get to the spiritual activities we feel God is pleased with. Remember, we are told to \"pray without ceasing\". How can we do this unless we realize all of a life lifted up to God becomes a prayer, a type of living intercession? What truly makes life simple is having an intimate relationship with Christ; following His principles, loving Him for who He is and not just for what He can do for us.",
    "prayer": "Dear Heavenly Father, Forgive me for the times I have lived only for self. Help me to see all that I do as giving glory to You, or the good of my fellowman. Help me to be true to Your principles, help me to live in an attitude of love and prayer. Amen. Keep looking up, in a loving attitude and endless prayer. You are in the prayers of two who care. Amen.",
