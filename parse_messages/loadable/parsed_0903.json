The goal of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit is not just to unite us to God, but to do it is such a way that we will be one with the Father in exactly the same way Jesus was. So what kind of oneness did Jesus Christ have with the Father??? He had such a oneness with the Father that He was obedient when His Father who sent Him down here to be poured out for us. AND He says to us, \"As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.\" (John 20:21) If we truly love the Lord, we have no business being guided by natural emotions, we have to feed His sheep. Beware of counterfeiting the love of God by following your own natural human emotions, sympathies, or understandings. That will only serve to revile and abuse the true love of God.",

It takes much more of the grace of God, and a much greater awareness of drawing upon Him, to take that next step, than it does to preach the Gospel. Every Christian must experience the essence of the incarnation by bringing the next step down into flesh-and-blood reality and by working it out with His hands. We need to be careful so as to not lose interest and give up when we have no vision, no encouragement, and no improvement, but only experience our every day trivial tasks. The thing that really testifies for God and for the people of God in the long run is steady perseverance, even when the work can not be seen by others.

And the heavenly Father, who offers to meet us in the inner chamber-let there be no doubt of this in our minds--has no other object than to fill our hearts with His love.

    "reflection": "\"Waiting upon God\" in this expression we find one of the deepest truths of God's Word in regard to the attitude of the soul in its communion with God. Waiting upon God. Just think --- maybe if we would just give Him an extra minute He would reveal Himself to us; that He may teach us all His will; that He may do to us what He has promised; that in all things He may be the infinite God. Waiting upon God. Is an attitude of the soul --- with which each day should begin. Upon awakening each morning, in quiet meditation, in the expression in prayer share your deepest longings and desires. In the course of our daily work, in our striving after obedience and holiness, in all our struggles against sin and self-will in everything there should be a waiting upon God to receive what He will bestow, to see what He will do, to allow Him to be Almighty God. Wait on God meditating on these things, and they will help you to value the precious promises of God's Word. They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. Wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and He shall strengthen thine heart. The deep root of all Scriptural theology is this: Absolute dependence on God. As we exercise this spirit, it will become more and more natural and blessedly possible to say: \"On Thee do I wait all the day.\"",
