(Mt. 21:5)\n\nOur Lesson for Today:\nSome would say, 'What kind of King would ride a donkey in a parade?'\nThere were no chariots with armed guards ~ No marching bands ~ No\nprancing steeds.' \"Hosanna,\" they shouted to Him, but what kind of\nKing was He?\n\nWell my answer is, ~ Jesus is the eternal God whose throne fills the \nheavens and whose scepter casts it's shadow over all the earth. But \nyes, He rides into Jerusalem in all lowliness to show that He's also man.\n\nYes He became one of us, took on our flesh to do what none of us could \ndo, to carry out the heavenly mission of salvation. Because he came ~\nin such humble form, many missed Him. Oh yes, they cheered when that\nstrange parade went by, but they went home and forgot all about Him.\n\nBut thank God He hasn't forgotten me. His coming in the flesh and His\nhumble entrance into Jerusalem were His way of saying, \"How could I\never forget you? I've become one of you. I came to be with you and to \ndie for you on Calvary's cross.\" So let us sing: \"Hosanna to the Highest.\"\n\nPrayer Suggestion:\nDear Lord, help me to see the reason behind Your humility,\nand then ride on into my heart...Amen.\nPastor Alvin & Marcie Sather\n\nThe Lord said, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life.\nNo one can come to the Father except through me.\" - John: 14:6",

It is never to late to turn to God. Even in His misery, Jesus had \nmercy on this criminal who decided to believe in Him. Yes, Christ accepts us\nin spite of our past. BUT our life will be much more useful and fulfilling if we\nturn to God early, but even those who repent at the very last moment will be\nwith God in paradise...\n\nPrayer Suggestion:\nDear Lord, please, in Your mercy and grace, so promise me...Amen.\nPastor Alvin & Marcie Sather\n\nThe Lord said, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life. \nNo one can come to the Father except through me.\" - John: 14:6",
