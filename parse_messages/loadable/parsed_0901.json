So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully developed, you will be strong in character. We can't fully know the depth of our character until we see how we react under pressure. It is easy to be kind and loveable towards others when everything is going well, but can we still be kind when others are treating us unfairly.

Well it is sad to say but most put their \nproblems on the back burner and go their own directions.\n\nIt also takes relational courage to build significant relationships with \nfriends, to look another person in the eye and say, \"Isn't it time we\nstopped talking about the weather and the stock market and start\ntalking about what's going on in your life and mine? Isn't it time we\nbecame brothers?\"\n\nNot many men have the courage to challenge each other, to fight for\neach other's spiritual and relational growth. But I have learned over the \nyears that I will not be a success in my marriage, with my kids or with\nmy friends, without courage...\n\nPrayer Suggestions:\nPray for the courage to share your feelings with family\nfriends, and other acquaintances in humility.

David's interests were more important to Jonathan than his own, and David felt the same way about Jonathan's interests. If you take the time to study the friendship between David and Jonathan, you will come away with a good understanding of what a healthy friendship between men can and should have.

    "reflection": "What makes the temptation of power so seemingly irresistible? is it that, power offers an easy substitute for the hard task of love? It seems easier to be God than to love God, easier to control people than to love people, easier to own life that to love life. The long painful history of the church is the history of the people ever and again tempted to choose power over love, control over the cross, being a leader over being led. Those who have resisted this temptation are truly saints, and in the end give us hope.",
