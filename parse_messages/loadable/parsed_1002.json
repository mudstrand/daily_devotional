If I am\ntelling the truth, why don't you believe Me? (Jn. 8:46)\n\nOur Lesson for Today:\nWho can we believe these days? We've learned to take the words of the\nsalesman, the politician, and others with a \"grain of salt.\" the more they urge\nus, \"Believe me,\" the more we back away. Thank God, there is one Person \nwe can believe - totally. What He says, we can trust - completely...\n\nWhy do we need a sinless Jesus? ~ Because a sinless Jesus is one who \nnever speaks a lie or stretches the truth. When He says He will never leave us \nor forsake us, we can take it as gospel truth. When He says our sins are plunged\ninto the depths of the sea, that promise also stands sure as the heavens above.\nWhen He says He will walk with us through the shadow, He's going to be there. \n\nJesus says, \"Believe Me.\" ~ How foolish not to!!!\n\nPrayer Suggestion:\nYes, Lord, I believe, by Your grace and the Spirit's working.\nHelp me to always do so...Amen.\nPastor Alvin & Marcie Sather\n\nThe Lord said, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life. \nNo one can come to the Father except through me.\" - John: 14:6",
