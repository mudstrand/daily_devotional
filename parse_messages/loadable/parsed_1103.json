    "reflection": "Confession is suppose to free us to enjoy fellowship with Christ. It should ease our conscience and lighten our cares. But some Christians do not understand how it works. They feel so guilty they confess the same sins over and over; then they wonder if they might have forgotten something. Other Christians believe that God forgives them when they confess, but if they died with unconfessed sin, they would be forever lost. These Christians do not understand that God wants to forgive us. He allowed His beloved Son to die just so He could offer us pardon. When we come to Christ, he forgives all the sins we have committed. We don't need to confess the sins of our past all over again, and we don't need to fear that God will reject us if we don't keep our slate perfectly clean. . . Of course we should continue to confess sins, but not because failure to do so will make us lose our salvation. Our relationship with Christ is secure. ~ Instead, we should confess so that we can enjoy maximum fellowship and joy with Him. Remember, ~ True confession also involves a commitment not to continue to sin. ~ We wouldn't be genuinely confessing our sins to God if we planned to commit them again and just wanted temporary forgiveness. Remember, ~ We should always pray for strength to defeat temptation the next time we face it. Question, ~ If God has forgiven us for our sins because of Christ's death, why must we confess our sins? ? ? Answer, ~ In admitting our sins and receiving Christ's cleansing we are, (1) agreeing with God that our sin truly is sin and that we are willing to turn form it, (2) ensuring that we don't conceal our sins from Him and consequently from ourselves. and (3) recognizing our tendency to sin and relying on His power to overcome it.",
