But I tell \nyou the truth: It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away the Counselor \nwill not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.\" (Jn. 16:6, 7) NIV\n\nOur Thought for Today:\n\nUnless Jesus did what He came to do, there would be no Good News. If He did not die,\nHe could not remove our sins; He could not rise again and defeat death.\n\nIf He did not go back to the Father, the Holy Spirit would not come, Christ's presence on \nearth was limited to one place at a time.

    "reflection": "Jesus tell us that the Holy Spirit has three important tasks, (1) convicting the world of its sin and calling it to repentance, (2) revealing the standard of God's righteousness to anyone who believes, because Christ would no longer be physically present on earth, and (3) demonstrating Christ's judgment over Satan. In vs. 9 according to Jesus, not believing in Him is sin. Christ's death on the cross made a personal relationship with God available to us. When we confess our sin, God declares us righteous and delivers us from judgment for our sins. This country once again needs to listen to the Holy Spirit and confess its sins.",
