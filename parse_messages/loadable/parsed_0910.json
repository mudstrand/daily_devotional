    "reflection": "In Jesus' day, people had only the fields to hide their valuables. At night while it was dark or while an enemy was approaching they would bury their treasures. The treasure might stay there for years if something happened to the owner. Then one day a farmer while working the field would feel a tug on his plow, and the treasure would lie exposed. What a find! There it is. It's his and he's rich. Some may still ask, \"What treasure is Jesus speaking of in this parable?\" Of course many of us know that it is 'Himself'. He means the rubies of forgiveness for all my sins, made red by His blood. He means the gold pieces of His peace for my soul, restored to fellowship with my Creator. He means the diamonds of eternal life, glittering in heaven for me. Christ and all He is, all He offers, all He has, are the treasures He wants me to have. What is your greatest treasure? Hopefully, Jesus, Jesus, only Jesus.",

How ever, such words are more often than not, just greetings rather then words from the heart. The apostle Paul begins each of his letters with our verse or a variation of it.

He's extending the usual greeting to his ethnically mixed readers just as we use common greetings today. But his words grace and peace are more than just greetings. They are statements of fact for believers. Grace is the quality of God that makes Him eager to give to totally undeserving people the best that He has to offer. In the word's five letters are summed up the forgiveness of sins God has prepared in His Son, the fear-free conscience He gives to those who trust His Son, and the firm hope of heaven waiting for them through His Son.

Ahead lies the promised land to which God \nwill lead His people of all times, that heavenly Canaan with its everlasting glory...\n\nJohn in Rev. 15:3 says of believers here: \"[They] sang the song of Moses the\nservant of God and the song of the Lamb: 'Great and marvelous are Your deeds, \nLord God Almighty. Just and true are Your ways King of the ages.'\"\n\nLooking ahead to heaven's eternal victory, the Israelites had something to sing about.\nBut they forgot. They let their present-day problems fog over God's long-range promise \nof heaven...\n\nThey even let that fog cloud over the lovely face of the Savior who would lead them\ninto eternity...\n\nThe same can happen to us, when we get lost in every-day problems and sorrows.\nIf we would only take a long range view, nobody would have to remind us to sing...\n\nPrayer Suggestion:\nDear Lord, in all conditions of life, teach me to\nsing joyously because of what is waiting for me\nin heaven...Amen.\n\nPastor Al & Marcie Sather",
