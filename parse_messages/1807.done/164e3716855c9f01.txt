VERSE FOR TODAY:

_Pride goes before destruction, and haughtiness before the fall._

(Pro. 16:18)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

Proud people take little account of their weakness and do not

anticipate stumbling blocks. They think they are above frailties

of common people. In this state of mind they are easily tripped

up. It is important that we keep our pride in check. so we should

ask someone we trust whether self satisfaction has blinded you

to warning signs. He or she may help you avoid a fall.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Lord, I pray that I would listen to the warnings of those I

have always trusted so that I will not fall into the trap of self

pride. I pray this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. . . Amen.
