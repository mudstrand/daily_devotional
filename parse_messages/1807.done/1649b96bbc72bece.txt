VERSE FOR TODAY:

_Plans go wrong for lack of advice; many counselors bring success._

(Pro. 15:22)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

People with tunnel vision, those who are locked into one way of
thinking,

are likely to miss the right road because they have closed their
minds to

any new options. We need the help of those who can enlarge our vision

and broadening of our perspective. We need to seek out the advise of
those

who know us and have a wealth of experience. We need a network of

advisors. We also need to open our minds to new ideas, and be willing
to

weigh their suggestions carefully.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Heavenly Father, I pray for Your forgiveness because I often run

ahead of You, not praying for guidance as I should, I pray this in
the

name of Jesus Christ. . . Amen.
