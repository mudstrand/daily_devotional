02/14/2010~~~food for thought~~~EVERY DAY IS A VALENTINE'S DAY...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down 
His life for us. (I Jn. 3:16)

Our Lesson for Today:
"Will you be my valentine?" Remember cards like that? Remember when
we used to send them? Perhaps we still do to show our love for someone
special...

Have you ever stopped to think that everyday is Valentines Day with God?
He doesn't limit His show of love to one day a year. He loves every day and
has been doing so since the world began. He doesn't merely say, "I love you," 
or simply send a card. He shows His love in actions.

How did He show His love to me this past week? Well it could have been in the 
form of family members who laughed with me when I was happy and cried with 
me when I was sad. Or in the form of strength against temptation. or healing for
a hurting body. It could be in success in some venture, and guidance for some 
decision.

Yes God's love flows down on us constantly. Every day His love sends us a valentine.
Best of all Jesus loved us so much He willingly took our place on the cross so sin's
punishment might be paid in full...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I need Your Love every day. Please be my valentine
today and always...Amen.

No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
