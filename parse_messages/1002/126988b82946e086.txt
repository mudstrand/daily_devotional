02/04/2010~~~food for thought~~~WHAT DO YOU CRAVE???

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Like new born babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it
you may grow up in your salvation, now that you have tasted 
that the Lord is good...(I Pet. 2:2, 3)

Our Lesson for Today:
One Characteristic all children share is that they want to grow up,
to be like big brother or sister or like their parents...

When we are born again, we become spiritual newborn babies.
If we are healthy, we will yearn to grow. How sad it is that some 
never grow up. the need for milk is a natural instinct for a baby,
and it signals the desire for nourishment that will lead to growth...

Once we see our need for God's Word and begin to find nourishment
in Christ, our spiritual appetite will increase, and we will start to mature.
How strong is your desire for God's Word...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, give me an appetite for the Word that I may grow...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to The father except through me." - John: 14:6
