02/05/2010~~~food for thought~~~BE WISE ~ BUILD ON THE ROCK...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Everyone who hears these words of Mine and puts them into 
practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock...(Mt. 7:24)

Our Lesson for Today:
Jesus has more in mind than a course in architectural design or intelligent 
house building. He's talking about lives and souls, about using our lives to
be built on Him and readied for heaven...

To build "on solid rock" means to be a hearing, responding disciple, not a 
phony, superficial one. Practicing obedience becomes the solid foundation
to weather the storms of life...

Take a look at James 1:22-27 for more on putting into practice what you
hear...

Prayer Suggestion:
"On Christ, the solid rock, I stand: All other ground
is sinking sand." Lord, help me to pray so as to learn
how to build a solid foundation...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
