02/16/2010~~~food for thought~~~VICTORY IN JESUS!!!

Our Bible Verses for Today:
The tempter came to Jesus and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones 
to become bread." Jesus answered, "It is written: Man does not live by bread alone,
but by every word that comes from the mouth of God." (Mt. 4:3, 4)

Our Lesson for Today:
Do the words of Satan sound familiar? "IF," If you are God's child, how come 
you have trouble?" "How come you're sick?" "How come your loved ONE has 
cancer or your teenager is rebellious." Yes Satan always begins with that ridiculous 
little word "IF".

What are we to do? LOOK TO JESUS!!! "The reason the Son of God appeared
was to destroy the devil's work," Scripture tells us in (1 Jn 3:8). now when Satan 
knocks on my heart's door, I can say, "Away from me." Satan can't win when Christ 
fights alongside me...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, strengthen me when the devil attacks so that
You and I together gain the victory...Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
