02/26/2010~~~food for thought~~~SANDWICHES FOR THE STOMACH...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were 
seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish...(Jn. 6:11)

Our Lesson for Today:
By our Bible verse for today do you realize what happens when you allow Jesus
to take over? In His powerful hands, the fish sandwiches grew into enough to feed
the crowd. When all were satisfied, more was left over than what the boy had even 
started with...

Don't you wonder if the disciples ever forgot the powerful lesson learned that day?
OH how the Lord provides for the needs of the body. Do we really remember or do
we forget? Yes Christians too have needs, the difference lies in our reaction...

Some one once said, "There are three ways to react to trouble. You can take it on
the chin. You can take to drink. You can turn to religion." Where do I turn?
He who served up fish sandwiches to the crowd that day will supply what I need.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, Help me to lay all my cares on You,
trusting that You care for me...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
