02/15/2010~~~food for thought~~~WILL HEAVEN BE YOUR ETERNAL HOME???

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior
from there, the Lord Jesus Christ...(Phil. 3:20)

Our Lesson for Today:
After being gone for a week we usually long for home. I believe
that every Christian knows that feeling. Except, the home for which 
believers long for is a heavenly one. We love to sing, "I'm but a stranger
here. Heaven is my home." At funerals the words bring tears to our eyes.

BUT we still have to live in this world and use the things of this world.
But God help us live as one just passing through, not as one who is trying
to put down permanent roots. Lord help us rejoice that our name is recorded 
in Your book of life in heaven. God help us treasure the blessings we have as 
a citizen of heaven ~ forgiveness of every sin, help for every trouble, comfort 
for every sorrow, and heaven in the end...

Yes, heaven in the end. "We eagerly await a Savior from there."
When that day comes, We'll see heaven's flag waving and be truly at home 
with the Lord...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, keep me safe as a pilgrim in this world
till You take me to my heavenly home...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
