02/23/2010~~~LIFE - GIVING IN HIS WORD...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"I tell you the truth, if anyone keeps my word, he will
never see death." (Jn. 8:51)

Our Lesson for Today:
I think that most would agree, that the fear of death is universal.
So when Jesus spoke about never seeing death, wouldn't we have expected
those Pharisees to sit up and pay attention?

When He promised that those who hear and believe His Word would never have
to set foot in hell, shouldn't they have been listening with wide-open ears?

I don't much like death either. It's not my favorite topic of conversation. NOR is there
any greater grief than caused by the loss of a loved one. BUT we don't have to 
be afraid of death. Not since Jesus filled Calvary's cross and emptied Joseph's tomb.

YES, "The wages of sin is death," and that is what the sinless Son of God came to pay.
He carried our sins on His sinless shoulders, in Him I have the guarantee that I shall live 
forever. Jesus says, "Believe Me." How foolish not to!

Prayer Suggestion:
Yes, Lord, I believe ~ by Your grace and the Spirit's working.
Help me to always do so...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
