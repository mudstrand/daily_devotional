02/21/2010~~~food for thought~~~SEARCHING FOR THE TRUTH...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"You search the Scriptures because you believe they give you eternal life.
But the Scriptures point to Me! ~ Yet you refuse to come to Me so that I
can give you this eternal life...(Jn. 5:39, 40)

Our Lesson for Today:
The religious leaders knew what the Bible said but failed to apply its words 
to their lives. They knew the teachings of the Scriptures but failed to see
the Messiah to whom the Scriptures pointed...

They knew the rules but missed the Savior. ~ WHY? ~ It was because 
they were so hung-up on their own religious systems, that they refused to
let the Son of God change their lives...

Today People are so hung-up on the ways of the world, that they refuse to
let the Savior change their lives. Let us not become so involved in the world
or "religion" that we miss Christ...

Only Christ can save, not a bunch of "religious" rituals...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, as I open the Scriptures help me to see
Jesus, my Savior standing there...Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather
The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
