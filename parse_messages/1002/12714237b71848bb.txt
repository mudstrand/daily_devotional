02/28/2010~~~food for thought~~~HE WASHED THEIR FEET...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
He poured water into a basin and began to wash His disciples feet,
drying them with the towel that He wrapped around Him...(Jn. 13:5)

Our Lesson for Today:
What a model servant Jesus portrayed to His disciples. Washing guests feet was 
a job for a household servant to carry out when guests arrived. But Jesus wrapped
a towel around His waist, as the lowliest slave would do, and washed and dried His
disciples' feet.

If even He, God in the flesh, is willing to serve, we His followers must also be servant,
willing to serve in any way that glorifies God. ~ Are you willing to follow Christ's example 
of serving? ~ Whom can you serve today?

There is a special blessing for those who not only agree that humble service is Christ's 
way, but who also follow through and do it. In (Jn. 13:17). Jesus says, "You know these 
things ~ now do them! That is the path of blessing."

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, wash not just my feet but all of me
with Your cleansing blood...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to The father except through me." - John: 14:6
