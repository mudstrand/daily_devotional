02/25/2010~~~food for thought~~~SALVATION FOR THE SOUL...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
When Jesus landed and step out of the boat He saw the large crowd,
He had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without
a shepherd. So He began teaching them many things...(Mk. 6:34)

Our Lesson for Today:
This crowd was as pitiful as a flock of sheep without a shepherd. Sheep 
are easily scattered; without a shepherd they are in grave danger...

Yes Jesus calls us all sheep, sheep who have gone astray. Jesus is the 
Shepherd who can teach us what we need to know to keep us from straying 
from God. How does one find Jesus. WELL if you don't know, He is in that 
dusty Book on your end table, or He may have even ended up in that 
Book on the shelf of your bedroom closet. Lets find that book again, 
Jesus is waiting there to feed you, the Bread of Life...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, feed me from Your Book, the Bread of Heaven.
so that once again my soul will be satisfied...Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
