Our Bible Verse for Today:
For no matter how many promises God has made, they are "Yes"
in Christ. (2 Cor. 1:20)

Our Lesson for Today:
When God makes a promise, we can take His word for it.
Isn't that what Christian faith is all about? "YES!" It is the
confidence that whatever God says He means...

Notice what Paul said. All of God's promises are "yes" in Christ.
Everything He has promised for our salvation in Christ He has done.
Everything else He promises for our lives, He will also surely do...

Christ is God's "YES." in big letters and bold print, for all His claims.
When He promises, "Take heart ~ your sins are for given" (Mt. 9:2)
We can bank on His words. Not only does God promise, but in Christ 
He has put His powerful love behind all His claims...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, in Jesus show me that I can take You at Your
word whenever You Speak...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
