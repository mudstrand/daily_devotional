02/18/2010~~~food for thought~~~TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"All this I will give you," he [Satan] said, "if you will bow down and worship me."
Jesus said to him, "Away from me Satan! For it is written:" 'Worship the Lord
your God, and serve Him only.' " (Mt. 4:9, 10)

Our Lesson for Today:
"Take the easy way," Satan was telling Christ in this third temptation. Here's a 
kingdom without a crown of thorns and without a cross of nails to be had just 
for bowing down before me."

Sound familiar? "Why work so hard? Look at what others get away with."
Why not let down the standards and loosen the doctrine?" Satan hints to
the church member. "Take the easy way," he tells us as he magically brings
before our eyes the things of this world...

What to do? ~ One thing only, Look to Jesus. Through Jesus, we who believe 
will one day stand in heaven, not only cleansed from our sins against the First 
Commandment but with its perfect keeping in our hand. On it will be printed, 
"Made by Jesus Christ."

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I thank You for keeping God's commandments
and making it count for me...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
