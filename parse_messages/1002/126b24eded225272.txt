02/09/2010~~~food for thought~~~LET ME SEE HIS SHINING FACE...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
There He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun,
and His clothes became as white as the light...(Mt. 17:2)

Our Lesson for Today:
How do we describe the glory shining in Jesus' face and through His
clothing that day? Not some outside glory beaming down on Him, but
arising from within Him. A glory that far outshone the sun's brightest rays
in the sky. The radiant glory of God Himself, for that's who Jesus is!!!

From such a shining face, we can only fall back in fear. When God and 
man stand face-to-face, man must step aside. God wanted a face-to-face 
relationship with us. But Adam's sin spoiled it all. Now when God comes, 
sin's curse can only turn us away from His glorious face...

We need to look from Jesus' holy face to His loving face. We need to learn
what He has done with our sins so we can have that face-to-face relationship
with Him already here on earth and forever in heaven...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, remind me how You made me holy
by Your blood so I could see Your holy face...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
