02/10/09~~~food for thought~~~LET ME SEE YOUR LOVING FACE...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with
Jesus. They spoke about His departure, which He was about to bring about
to bring fulfillment at Jerusalem...(Lk. 9:30, 31)

Our Lesson for Today:
What were they talking about? Well they went right to the heart of the matter ~
Jesus' death that was coming up in Jerusalem. The King James Version puts
it in a strange way ~ Jesus would accomplish death. We suffer death; there's
nothing we can do about it...

But Jesus accomplished death. That was a part of His work of salvation. The
cup of suffering with every bitter drop, the cross of nails with every bitter pain,
the open tomb with every blessed comfort, the salvation of the world ~ this He
was going to bring to fulfillment. AND this is what they talked about on that
mountain top...

Yes we would like to stay forever on that mountain top and bask in the sunshine 
of such love. But like the disciples we have to walk down into the sin- and tear-
filled plains of life. And it's down there that Jesus' love becomes very real for
us. YES, in daily life, where joy and sorrow, laughter and tears run together, we
need to know that Jesus loves us.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, let the sight of Your loving face assure me of
Your salvation and strength for my life...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
