01/03.10~~~food for thought~~~A NEW YEAR BUT THE SAME PEACE...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
The Lord gives His people strength.
The Lord blesses them with peace...(Ps. 29:11)

Our Lesson for Today:
How many of us know about threats and stress?
How many of us have carried burdens from the old year into the new?
How many of us have found that these burdens seem to pick up more weight day by day?
And who knows what new problems will drop down on our shoulders tomorrow?

What's the solution?
Where can we find release from our fears and relaxation under our burdens?
There's only one place ~ one person ~ the Lord.
He who prepared in Jesus the perfect peace we need for our souls 
will also provide what we need for our daily lives...

With our eyes on such a loving Lord, we can go forward even though the steps are painful.
We can smile even in the midst of tears.
If with hearts of faith, we lay our burdens before God, the result will always be peace...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, Help me to fasten my heart on Your gracious promise
and fill my life with Your peace...Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord is my strength, my shield from every danger.
I trust in Him with all my heart...(Ps. 29:7)
