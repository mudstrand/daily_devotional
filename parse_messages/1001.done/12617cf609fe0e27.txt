01/10/10~~~food for thought~~~OUR ORDERS REMAIN UNCHANGED...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation...(Mk. 16:15)

Our Lesson for Today:
Every hour on the hour, 365 days a year, a soldier reports for duty at the Tomb
of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery. The precision of the changing
of the guard is impressive. Even more impressive are the orders handed on. Always
the command is the same, "Orders remain unchanged."

Shouldn't we say the same about the command the risen Savior has given His
soldiers of all times? "Go," he charged, "into all the world." "Preach the good news,"
He commanded, "to all creation." "And when you have done it," He continued, "pass
the order onto those who follow you."

The orders of the day for believers are always the same, Not to guard a tomb in which 
an unknown body rests but to tell all creation of their living, loving Savior, their only Savior...

So soldiers of the cross, how goes it? ~ Whom have you told? You say, "I can't reach very far."
Well then, how about your family, your neighborhood, your small corner of the world?"
"I can't do very much!" you excuse...Well then, how about your prayers and dollars for missions?

We may never cross oceans to distant worlds. But we can build boats that carry those who go.
and we can fish in lakes right in our own backyards...

Prayer Suggestion:
Lord, here I am. Move me, use me, and bless my efforts
to tell others about You...Amen.
