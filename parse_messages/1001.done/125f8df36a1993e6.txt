12/04/10~~~food for thought~~~A NEW YEAR BUT THE SAME POWER...

Our Bible verse for Today:
Be strong in the Lord and His mighty power...(Eph. 6:10)

Our Lesson for Today:
Those rust nails wouldn't budge. I finally, reach for my 'power bar,' which has
a much longer handle. The nails finally let go and one by one came out of
the board. My 'power bar' gave me the extra power I needed...

None of us are strangers to temptation. Each of us has his own area of weakness
that the sly devil explores and the sinful world exploits. And the evil hearts within 
us never sleep or give up the struggle. You know what I'm talking about???

How long would the list be if we were to catalog the soft spots where temptations
sink in so easily? ~ How many times have we been pinned to the mat of sin
by the old evil foe instead of winning the match???

Will it get any better this new year?
Will our struggle against sin be more successful?
Not if we use only the puny hammer of our own efforts.
More power is needed.
And the Lord Jesus offers us that added power...
"[He] appeared...to destroy the devils work," Scripture tells us...(1 Jn. 3:8)

Not only has God's Son paid for our sins, but He has also broken Satan's
stranglehold on us. When Satan is successful in our lives, it's not because 
Christ's power has failed. BUT it is because our hold on His 'power bar' isn't 
as firm as it should be...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, tighten my grip on Your Word through
which You give my faith Your mighty power...Amen.

In the new year take time to be holy. Let the world rush on...

No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
