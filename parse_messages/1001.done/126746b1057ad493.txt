01/28/2010~~~food for thought~~~MY FRIEND STRENGTHENS MY FAITH...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
This, the first of His miraculous signs, Jesus performed in Cana
of Galilee. He thus revealed His glory, and His disciples put their
faith in Him...(Jn. 2:11)

Our Lesson for Today:
Far greater than the miracle of water turned into wine was the invisible
miracle that day at the wedding. As always Jesus' miracles were not to
make a grand display of Himself or dazzle those around Him. They were
intended as signs to point sinners to Him for the greater needs of their souls...

The miracles were powerful displays of His ability to rescue the people from
sin, death, and the devil. Though many missed the point, His disciples at Cana
that day didn't. Here is what we read of them, "His disciples put their faith in Him."

See what this heavenly friend did for them. He strengthened their faith. He became
closer and dearer to them, more precious and glorious than ever before...

Do we want our faith and friendship with Jesus strengthened? There is a way,
one that the world despises and that even some lukewarm friends of Jesus at 
times disregards. As we hear His Holy Word in our churches and read it at home,
He sends His Spirit to renew our faith. As we receive the Lord's Supper at His altar, 
He refreshes our hearts. And through the miracle of Holy Baptism, He makes and 
then reminds us of His promise that we are His and He is ours forever...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I invite You as a guest of my heart and home
with Your straightening of my faith...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
