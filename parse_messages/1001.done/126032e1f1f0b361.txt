01/06/10~~~food for thought~~~A NEW YEAR BUT THE SAME STAR...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
We saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him...(Mt. 2:2)

Our Lesson for Today:
We don't know much about the Magi. Scripture doesn't reveal what country they 
came from, how many there were, what occupations or names they had. What
we need to know about them, though, the biblical account has recorded... 

They were led by some mysterious star ~ "His" star ~ right to Jesus' side.
and when the Magi saw their infant Savior, they knew what to do.
They knelt down and worshiped Him...

The Magi were the first in a long line of Gentiles brought to the Savior, a line that
by God's grace includes us also. They were led by a star. Our star is even better.
"You word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path," the psalmist wrote (119:105),
and we would heartily agree. "We have seen His star," we say with the Magi, not in
the east, but, better still, in His Word.

Now the Lord has given us a new year in which to be guided by His Word to the Savior.
Modern Magi know where their eyes belong ~ on God's wondrous star...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help us to live in Your Holy Word,
and to see our Savior there...Amen.

No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
