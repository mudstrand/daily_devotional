01/24/2010~~~ OUR PRIVILEGE...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
With My authority take this message of repentance to all the nations,
beginning in Jerusalem: 'There is forgiveness of sins for all people
who turn to Me.' You are My witnesses of all these things...(Lk. 24:47, 48)

Our Lesson for Today:
As members of Christ's family, we have a responsibilities. Or perhaps we should
call them privileges. They are efforts we should put forward in a willing, grateful
response to what the Savior has done for our salvation...

Of course, such actions cover our whole lives. We want everything in word and 
deed to be done to His glory. But one privilege stands out above all others. That's 
the work the risen Savior has given us ~ to be His witnesses. We who have seen
His cross and empty tomb need to tell others. We need to share with the needy the 
Good News of the forgiveness of sins...

On the job??? Perhaps we can't all become a pastor or a teacher. Perhaps we can't 
all fly to distant continents or move to expanding areas of our country. But we can
still witness. We can tell the child on our lap, we can tell the neighbor down the street,
we can tell a coworker on the job about the Jesus who loves them. We can speak our 
prayers and we can bring our offerings for the spreading of the gospel...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, move me, use me, bless me...Amen

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the father except through Me." - John: 14:6
