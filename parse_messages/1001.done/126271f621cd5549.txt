Our Bible Verse for Today:
The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord scoffs at them. (Ps. 2:4)

Our Lesson for Today:
What's a person to do? The world in which we have to live and breath is
becoming increasingly polluted. All around us ~ in movies and TV ~ in adds
and commercials ~ and even within some churches, beats the appealing
chant that man can have it all ~ do it all ~ ignore it all. SO what are we supposed
to do???

Do we just shrug our shoulders and ask what else is new? ~ Do we just throw in 
the towel and surrender? Do we just say, thank God we have gray hair and won't
see what our grandchildren will have to face??? 

Or should we join David in today's verse? He raised his face to heaven, and what 
he saw comforted him. The sinful efforts of the world aren't enough to make the 
One who sits on heaven's throne even leave His seat...

Their feeble attempts to war against Him and His own are only enough to make Him
laugh. The Almighty Ruler of all has never heard anything so humorous as man's empty 
boasting. He's never seen anything so funny as mankind's incompetent attempts to 
get along without Him...

Yes we must all agree, times are evil. But we're not going to give up. Why should we?
We're going to win! He who sits in the heavens is laughing, and we with Him. His Word
still stands. His ways will still endure. And when the dust settles in the future as in the 
past, it will be victory that we shall see...

Prayer Suggestion:
Almighty God, fix our faith on You so that we have
comfort in the midst of life's turmoil...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
