Subject: The Power of Prayer


The Power Of Prayer:

Someone has said if Christians really understood the full extent of the power we have available through prayer, we might be speechless. Did you know that during World War II there was an adviser to Churchill who organized a group of people who dropped what they were doing every day at a prescribed hour for one minute to collectively pray for the safety of England, its people and peace?

There is now a group of people organizing the same thing here in America.
If you would like to participate:
Every evening at:

9:00 pm Eastern Time 

(8:00 PM Central) 

(7:00 PM Mountain) 

(6:00 PM Pacific), stop whatever you are doing and spend one minute praying for the safety of the United States, our troops, our citizens, and for a return to a Godly nation.
If you know anyone else who would like to participate, please pass this along.

Our prayers are the most powerful asset we have.

PLEASE FORWARD TO YOUR BELIEVING FRIENDS!
