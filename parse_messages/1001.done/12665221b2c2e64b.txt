01/25/2010~~~food for thought~~~MY FRIEND BRINGS ME TRUE JOY...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there,
and Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding...(Jn. 2:1, 2)

Our Lesson for Today:
Did you know that Jesus' first recorded miracle was at a wedding celebration?
He had just begun His ministry, just been baptized in the Jordan, just been
tempted in the wilderness, just called His first disciples, when we find Him at
a wedding reception? He was busy, as we can well imagine, but not to busy to
accept the invitation of this bride and groom. As a friend he was there rejoicing 
with them and even increasing their joy with His miracle of changing water into wine...

Dose this tell us something about the Christian? The world has it all wrong.
Believers are not the gloomiest; they are the happiest people on earth. Who
but the Christian can have real joy in this sin-muddied world? Only a life that
is faith filled, and hope filled can be a joyous one. And such a joyous life is
found in Christ, our heavenly Friend...

When His forgiveness fills our lives and His love colors our days, smiles, not frowns,
are in place. When our heavenly Friend stands beside us at our celebrations and 
in our daily lives, our smiles are heightened and our joys brightened...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, fill my heart with joy and my life with
smiles through Your presence...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
