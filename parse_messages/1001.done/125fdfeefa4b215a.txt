01/05/10~~~food for thought~~~A NEW YEAR BUT THE SAME PROMISE...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
If I go to prepare and place for you, I will come back and
take you to be with Me that you also may be where I am...(Jn. 14:3)

Our Lesson for Today:
Jesus' words show that the way to eternal life, though unseen, is secure ~
as secure as your trust in Jesus, He has already prepared the way to eternal 
life. The only issue that may still be unsettled is your willingness to believe...

The verse that we have today has two rich promises:
"I am going to prepare a place for you." And,
"I will come back and get you."

Yes we can look forward to eternal life because Jesus has answered
that question so clearly to us. The only way is through His blood that
has cleansed us from all sin and His righteousness clothes us for 
heaven.

That's His promise, and it holds true into a new year and into all eternity...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, keep us ready for heaven by covering us
with your blood and righteousness...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
