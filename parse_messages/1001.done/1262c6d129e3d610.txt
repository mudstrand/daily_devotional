01/14/2010~~~food for thought~~~JUST ANOTHER DAY?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name
of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.
(Col. 3:17)

Our Lesson for Today:
How ordinary life can seem. Day after day we get up, clean up, and hurry up,
off to the duties of another day. Then we return home, have supper, clean up
the kitchen, watch some TV, and head back to bed. But don't forget to set the
alarm, because tomorrow it starts all over again...

But for Christians it should never be just another day. Because each day the Lord
gives us golden opportunities to serve Him ~ to show our appreciation for the eternal
life that He has already given us...

Just as a hot dog without mustard doesn't taste right, so life without Christ has no zip.
But add the Savior and life takes on new meaning. The "just another day" becomes
another day to serve Him in grateful love...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, take our moments and our days,
let them flow in ceaseless praise...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
