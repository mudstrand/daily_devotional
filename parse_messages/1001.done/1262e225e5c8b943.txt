01/15/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE ONLY BREAD...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
I am the bread of live. He who comes to Me will never go hungry. (Jn. 6:35)


Our Lesson for Today:
Like our body, our soul needs bread or it will die. But unlike our bodies,
stuff that looks like bread will not do the job. Some set before the
hungry soul the loaves of man's own works. But such bread does not
contain the vitamins of forgiveness...

Others serve up the packaged loaves of man's own theology. But such
bread is full of holes, holding no sure promise of an eternal home. Where
do you find good bread? The hungry soul needs to know...

In Jesus! When He described Himself as the bread of life, He had more
than flour, shortening, and water in mind. He meant His perfect life that would
fulfill all of God's commands and His precious blood that would be spilt in full
payment for all sins...

The soul, famished because of sin, can feast on Jesus' payment and be filled.
The soul, hungry for a perfect life to present to God in the judgement, can reach 
for Jesus' righteousness and be satisfied. For the hungry sinner, Jesus is not
just good bread. He is the only bread...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, help me to feast on You
through my use of Your Word...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
