Our Bible Verse for Today:
Whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is my
brother and sister and mother...(Mt. 12:50)

Our Lesson for Today:
Jesus tells us. "Whoever does the will of My Father in heaven," 
He says, "Is my brother and sister and mother." What does He mean with
"does the will of My Father in heaven"? Guest what He tells us that too.
In John 6:40 He explains, "My Father's will is that everyone who looks to the 
Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life."

So the heavenly Father's dearest wish is that everyone recognize Jesus as 
His own Son sent from heaven to pay for the sins of us all so that we can live
with Him forever...

To put it another way, He wants us to believe that only Jesus can turn us from
enemies into beloved family members...

In earthly families, blood bonds us together. In Christ's family, it is faith, the 
gift of the Holy Spirit. When God brings us to faith in His Son as our only Savior,
we're Jesus' brother or sister or mother. I'm a dear family member, closer to
Him than anyone else, sure of sharing His home in heaven...How about you?

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, bond me into Your eternal family by giving me
faith in You as my only Savior...Amen

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the father except through me." John: 14:6
