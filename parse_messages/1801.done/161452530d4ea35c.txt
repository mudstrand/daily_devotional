VERSE FOR TODAY:

_"I am sure that God, who began a good work within you, will continue
_

_His work until it is finally finished on that day when Jesus comes
back _

_again." _(Phil. 1:6)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

Do you sometimes feel as I do, that you aren't making any progress in

your spiritual life?_ _ Scriptures tell us that when God starts a
project, He

completes it! As with the Philippians, Scriptures also tells us God
will

help us grow in grace until He has completed His work in our life.
When

we become discouraged, let us pray for patience and remember that God

HAS promised He will complete the work He has begun in us.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me when I become discouraged with my

spiritual growth I know You have promised to finish the work You have

begun. Forgive me for my lack of patience. . .Amen.
