07/21/08 ~~~ food for thought) ~~~ You don't have to lie awake nights to succeed
Just stay awake days. (Jn. 9:4)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

All who rely on observing the law are under a curse, for it is
written: "Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do 
everything written in the book of the law."

Clearly no one is justified before God by the law, because,
"The righteous will live by faith." (Gal. 3:10, 11) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Trying to be right with God by our own effort doesn't work.
Good intentions such as "I will do better next time" or "I'll
never do that again" usually end in failure...

Paul points to Habakkuk's declaration (Hab. 2:4) that by
trusting God ~ believing in His provision for our sins and
living each day in His power ~ we can break this cycle of 
failure...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to walk each day in faith 
in Christ's finished work on the cross. Help to pray without 
ceasing renewing my mind and spirit...Amen.

Keep looking up, in an attitude of prayer...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
