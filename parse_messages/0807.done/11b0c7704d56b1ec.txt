Our Bible Verses for Today:

When Peter came to Antioch, (Paul says) I opposed him to his face,
because he was clearly in the wrong...

Before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles.
But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself 
from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the
circumcision group...(Gal 2:11, 12) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Even though Peter was the leader of the church he was acting like a
hypocrite. He knew better, yet he was driven by fear of what James 
and the others would think...

Pro. 29:25 says, "Fearing people is a dangerous trap." Paul knew
that he had to confront Peter before his actions damaged the church...

So, Paul publicly opposed Peter. But we need to note, that Paul did not
go the other leaders, nor did he write letters to the churches telling
them not to follow Peter's example. Instead he opposed Peter face to face...

Sometimes sincere Christians even Christian leaders, make mistakes,
and it takes other sincere Christians to get them back on track. If you are
convinced that someone is doing harm to himself/herself or the church, 
try the direct approach...

There is no place for back-stabbing in the body of Christ...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, help me to remain humbles yet honest
and straight to the point while correcting a straying Christian.
Help me to remember that Christians are to be shepherds not
commandos...Amen.

Keep looking up, for Godly wisdom...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
