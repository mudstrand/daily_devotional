Our Bible Verse for Today:

Consider Abraham: He believed God, and it was credited to him
as righteousness...

Understand, then, that those who believe are children of Abraham.

The Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith,
and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: "All nations
will be blessed through you."

So those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man
of faith...(Gal 3:6-9)

Our Lesson for Today:

The main argument that Paul had to deal with from the Judaizers was 
that Gentiles had to become Jews in order to become Christians...

But Paul exposed the flaw in this argument by showing that real children
of Abraham are those who have faith, not those who keep the law.
Abraham himself was saved by faith (Gen. 15:6)...

The wonderful promise is that all believers in every age and from every
nation share Abraham's blessing. This is a comforting promise, a great
heritage for us, a solid foundation for living...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, we truly have much to rejoice about though our
personal relationship with Jesus Christ. We can truly sing, "What a fellowship, 
what a joy divine, leaning on the everlasting arms." I pray once again for a
great revival so that this song would be the anthem of our nation...Amen.

Keep looking up in an attitude of Prayer...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
