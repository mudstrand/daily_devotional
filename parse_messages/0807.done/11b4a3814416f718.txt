Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul says: "Let me take an example from everyday life.
Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant 
that has been duly established, so it is in this case..."

The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed.
The Scripture does not say, 'and to his seeds,' meaning
many people, but "and to your seed," meaning one person,
who is Christ...

What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does 
not set aside the covenant previously established by God and 
thus do away with the promise... (Gal. 3:15-17) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

God kept His promise to Abraham (Gen. 17:7, 8) ~ He has not revoked it, 
though thousands of years have passed. He saved Abraham through his 
faith, and He blessed the world through Abraham by sending the Messiah 
as one of Abraham's descendants...

Circumstances may change, but God remains constant and does not break 
His promises. He has promised to forgive our sins through Jesus Christ, 
and we can be sure He will do so. Praise the Lord, what a Savior...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your promise to forgive all
who confess their sins. I thank You for the promise of salvation
through Your Son of Lord Jesus Christ. I lay before you today again
my sins wash my heart white as snow...Amen.

Keep looking up, in an attitude of prayer...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
