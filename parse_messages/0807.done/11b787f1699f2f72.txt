07/31/08~~~(food for thought)~~~Put others before yourself, and you can become
a leader among men...(Mt. 20:26, 27)

Our Bible Verse for Today:

When the time had fully come, God sent His Son,
born of a woman, born under the law,

to redeem those under the law, that we might receive
the full rights of sons...(Gal 4:4, 5) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

"When the right time came." I love these words because it reminds
me that God's time is perfect. We need to remember this when we 
are dealing with the storms of this life...

Yes when the time was right God even sent His Son to earth to die 
for our sins. For centuries the Jews had been wondering when their
Messiah would come ~ but God's timing was perfect...

Oh yes we too may sometimes wonder if God will ever respond to
our prayers. BUT we must never doubt Him or give up hope. At the
right time He will respond...

Are you waiting for God's timing??? Trust His judgment and trust that
He has your best interests in mind...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for becoming so focused on the 
storms of this life, that I loose sight of You. Help me to trust in Your
judgment with the assurance that you have my best interests in mind...Amen.

Keep looking up, keep your focus on Him...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
