the second is listening. (Pro. 1:5).

Our Bible Verses for Today:

For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer
depends on the promise; but God in His grace gave it to
Abraham through a promise...

What, then, was the purpose of the law? It was added because 
of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred
had come. The law was put into effect through angels by a mediator...
(Gal 3:18, 19) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

We need to remember the law has two functions. On the positive
side, it reveals the nature and will of God and shows people how
to live...

On the negative side, it points out people's sins and shows them 
it is impossible to please God by trying to obey all His laws completely.

God's promise to Abraham dealth with Abraham's faith; the law focuses 
on actions. The covenant with Abraham shows that faith is the only way 
to be saved; the law shows how to obey God in grateful response...

Faith does not annul the law, but the more we know God, the more we 
see how sinful we are, and so we are driven to depend on our faith in 
Christ alone for our salvation...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I bow humbly before You today
in recognition of my sinful being. I bring all my sins before 
you today, because I need Your power to over come the 
temptations of Satan. Increase my faith that I might realize 
that I need to turn to You each and every day for added strength...Amen.

Keep looking up in an attitude of prayer...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
