than with your mouth...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

There is neither Jew or Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, 
for you are all one in Christ Jesus...(Gal. 3:28) NIV 

Our Lesson for Today:

Some Jewish males greeted each new day by praying, "Lord I thank
You that I am not a Gentile, a slave, or a woman." The role of a woman
was enhanced by Christianity...

Faith in Christ transcends these differences and makes all believers one
in Christ. We need to make sure we do not impose distinctions that Christ
has removed.

Because all believers are His heirs, no one is more privileged or superior
to anyone else. We need to make a point to seek out and appreciate people
who are not just like us or our friends. We may find that we have a lot in 
common with them...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for the times I may have
looked down my nose at someone who looked different than
me or my friends. Help me to love even the people who are 
different because You have created us all one in Christ...Amen.

Keep looking up, in an attitude of prayer...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
