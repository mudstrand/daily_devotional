07/05/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ Did you remember to give thanks this 
year for the freedom we enjoy?

Our Bible Verses for Today:

They only heard the report: "The man who formerly persecuted 
us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy...

And they praised God because of me...(Gal. 1:23, 24) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul's changed life had brought praise from those who saw him
or heard about him. His new life had astonished them. They had 
praised God because only God could have turned this zealous 
persecutor of Christians into a Christian himself...

We may not have had as dramatic a change as Paul, but still our
new life should honor God in every way. When people look at you, 
do they recognize that God has made changes in you?

If not perhaps your not living as you should...

Our prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for what You have done
in my life, but I still need further help, I don't always live as 
I should...Amen.

Keep looking up, He has more he wants to do in your life...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
