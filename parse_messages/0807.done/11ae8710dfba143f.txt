07/03/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ Pray always for the courage seek God's approval...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Am I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God?
Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to
please men, I would not be a servant of Christ...(Gal. 1:10) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Do you seem to be spending your life pleasing everybody?

Paul had to speak harshly to the Christians in Galatia they were in serious
danger. Paul did not apologize for his straight-forward words, knowing
that they could not serve Christ faithfully if he allowed the Galatian Christians 
to remain on the wrong track...

Whose approval are you seeking ~ others or God's? Pray for the courage
to seek God's approval above anyone else's...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to be polite to those around me,
but also help me to remember that I owe my life to You, so there
will be times I will have to have the courage to say no to man in
order to say yes to You. I pray for a safe holiday for all my e-mail
friends...Amen.

Keep looking up, remembering who we truly serve...
You are in the Prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
