07/21/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ Let us never compromise the truth of 
God's Word...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

If, while we seek to be justified in Christ, it becomes evident
that we ourselves are sinners, does that mean that Christ 
promotes sin? Absolutely not!

If I rebuild what I destroyed, I prove that I am a law breaker,

For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God.
(Gal. 2:17-19) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Through the study of the Old Testament Scriptures, Paul realized
that he could not be saved by obeying God's Laws. The prophets 
knew that God's plan of salvation did not rest on keeping the law...

Because we have all been infected by sin, we can not keep God's 
laws perfectly. Fortunately, God has provided a way of salvation
that depends upon Jesus Christ, not on our own efforts...

Even though we know this truth, we must guard against the temptation 
of using service, good deeds, charitable giving, or any other effort as
a substitute for faith...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Forgive me for the times I 
slip into thinking that my service is my open door to
eternal life, I truly know better, but it is my human
nature to want have a hand in seeking Your favor. I 
know that my works are but filthy rags...Amen.

Keep looking up, from whence cometh our strength
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
