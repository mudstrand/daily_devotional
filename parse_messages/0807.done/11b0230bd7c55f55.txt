Our Bible verses for Today:

Because some false brothers had infiltrated our ranks to spy
on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves...

We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of
the gospel might remain with you... (Gal. 2:4, 5) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

We normally think of taking a stand against those who might lead
us into immoral behavior, but Paul had to take a hard-line against
the most "moral" of people...

We must not give in to those who make the keeping of man-made 
standards a condition for salvation, even when such people are 
morally upright or in respected positions...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, guide me in the truth that I might not
fall into the trap of believing in some man-made standards for
salvation, for Your Son Jesus Christ says, "I am the way, the
truth and the life, and no one comes to the Father but by me...Amen.

Keep looking to the Way...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
