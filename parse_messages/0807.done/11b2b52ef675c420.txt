07/24/08~~~(food for thought)~~~We need to remember our bodies are 
the temple of the Holy Spirit...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be
gained through the law, Christ died for nothing...(Gal. 2:21) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Believers today may still be in danger of acting as if Christ died
for nothing. HOW? By replacing Jewish legalism with their own
brand of Christian legalism, they are giving people extra laws to
obey...

By believing they can earn God's favor by what they do, they are 
not trusting completely in Christ's work on the cross. By struggling 
to appropriate God's power to change them, they are not resting 
in God's power to save them...

If we could be saved by being good, then Christ would not have 
had to die. But the cross is the only way to salvation...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Forgive me for the times I have attempted
to earn my salvation. Help me to grow in faith in Jesus Christ.
Help me to share my faith with those who do not know You as
they should...Amen.

Keep looking up, and He will answer your prayers...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
