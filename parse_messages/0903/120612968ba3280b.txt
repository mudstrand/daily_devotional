04/01/09~~~food for thought~~~Never be to busy to give God an extra minute...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"On Thee do I wait all the Day" (Ps. 22:5).

Our Lesson for Today:

"Waiting upon God" in this expression we find one of the deepest
truths of God's Word in regard to the attitude of the soul in its
communion with God...

Waiting upon God. Just think --- maybe if we would just give Him
an extra minute He would reveal Himself to us; that He may teach us 
all His will; that He may do to us what He has promised; that in all
things He may be the infinite God...

Waiting upon God. Is an attitude of the soul --- with which each day should begin.
Upon awakening each morning, in quiet meditation, in the expression in prayer
share your deepest longings and desires. In the course of our daily work, in our 
striving after obedience and holiness, in all our struggles against sin and self-will
in everything there should be a waiting upon God to receive what He will bestow,
to see what He will do, to allow Him to be Almighty God...

Wait on God meditating on these things, and they will help you to value the
precious promises of God's Word...

They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength...

Wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and He shall strengthen thine heart...

The deep root of all Scriptural theology is this: Absolute dependence on God.
As we exercise this spirit, it will become more and more natural and blessedly
possible to say: "On Thee do I wait all the day."

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray that each day you would take the time to
wait upon the Lord and be sensitive to His will...
