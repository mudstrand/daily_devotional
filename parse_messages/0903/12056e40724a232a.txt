03/30/09~~~food for thought~~~This is for those who do not believe in the Trinity...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

God the Father chose you long ago, and the Spirit has made you holy.
As a result, you have obeyed Jesus Christ and are cleansed by His blood.
(I Pet. 1:2)

Our Lesson for Today:

As we see here in this verse all three members of the Trinity are mentioned:
God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit...

Another important fact to recognize is that all three member of the Trinity
work to bring about our Salvation...

The Father chose us before we chose Him (Eph. 1:4)...
Jesus Christ, the Son died for us while we were still sinners (Ro. 5:6-10)...
The Holy Spirit brings us the benefits of salvation and sets us apart
(makes us holy, sanctifies us) for God's service (2 Thess. 2:13)

Let us always remind ourselves that, for all our communion with
God, the presence and the power of the Son and the Spirit are
absolutely necessary...

Prayer Suggestion:
Give thanks for all that He has done for us (me) even 
before we (I) Surrendered to Him...
