Thur. 05/09~~~food for thought~~~Is He really Your Lord?

Our Bible Verse for Today:

However, I consider my life worth nothing, if only I may finish
the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me,
the task of testifying to the Gospel of God's grace...(Acts 20:24).

Our Lesson for Today:

Our joy should come from seeing the complete fulfillment of the specific
purpose for which we were created and born again, not from successfully 
doing something of our own choosing...

The Joy our Lord experienced came from doing what the Father had sent 
Him to do. AND He says to us, "As the Father sent me, I also send you" 
(Jn. 20:21).

Have you received a ministry from the Lord? If so, you must be faithful to
it, to consider your life valuable only for the purpose of fulfilling that ministry.
Knowing that you have done what Jesus sent you to do, think how satisfying
it will be to hear Him say to you "Well done, good and faithful servant"
(Mt. 25:21).

We each have to find a niche in life, and spiritually we find it when we receive 
a ministry from the Lord. But to do this we must have close fellowship with
Jesus and must know Him as more than our personal Savior...

In John 21:17 Jesus asks "Do you love Me?" Then "Feed My sheep."
If we look closely we should realize that He is not offering us a choice of how
we can serve Him; He is asking for absolute loyalty to His commission, a
faithfulness to what we discern when we are in the closest fellowship with God.

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray that you would be sensitive and faithful to do 
what God has called you to do. Pray for a closer 
fellowship with Him...
