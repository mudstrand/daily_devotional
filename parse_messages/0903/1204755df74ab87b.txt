Our Bible Verse for Today:

For the Word of God is living, and active. Sharper than any two-edged sword,
it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the 
thoughts and attitudes of the heart...(Heb. 4:12)

Our Lesson for Today:

For fellowship with God, His Word and prayer are indispensable.
In His Word, He speaks to us. In prayer, we speak to Him...

The Word teaches us to know the God to whom we pray.
It teaches us how He would have us pray.
It gives us precious promises to encourage us in prayer.
It often gives us wonderful answers to prayer... 

The Word comes from God's heart and bring His thoughts and His love into our heart.
And then the Word goes back from my heart into His great heart of love...

Yes prayer is the means of fellowship between God's heart and ours...

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray that you would feel a greater need for His Word each day...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
