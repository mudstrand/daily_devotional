Tue. 03/09~~~Food for thought~~~It's not to late to obey His Commission...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Feed My Sheep." (Jn. 21:17b)

Our Lesson for Today:

This is love in the making. The love of God is not created--it is His nature...

When we receive the life of Christ through the Holy Spirit, He unites us
with God so that His love is demonstrated in us. The goal of the indwelling 
of the Holy Spirit is not just to unite us to God, but to do it is such a way
that we will be one with the Father in exactly the same way Jesus was...

So what kind of oneness did Jesus Christ have with the Father???

He had such a oneness with the Father that He was obedient when His Father 
who sent Him down here to be poured out for us. AND He says to us, "As the
Father has sent Me, I also send you." (Jn. 20:21)

If we truly love the Lord, we have no business being guided by natural emotions,
we have to feed His sheep...

Beware of counterfeiting the love of God by following your own natural human 
emotions, sympathies, or understandings. That will only serve to revile and
abuse the true love of God...

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray that your oneness with the Father would be like that
of Christ...
Pray that you would be obedient to God's commission, not
out of sympathy but out of Christ-like love...
