03/31/09~~~food for thought~~~Let us remember with shame how little we have believed in,
and sought after, God's love...


Our Bible Verse for Today:

"God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God,
and God in him" (1 Jn. 4:16).

Our Lesson for Today:

The best and most wonderful word in heaven is Love.
for God is Love...

And the best and most wonderful word in the inner chamber
must be-- Love. For God meets us there in Love...

What is love? It is the deep desire to give oneself for the beloved.
Love finds its joy in imparting all that it has to make the loved one happy...

And the heavenly Father, who offers to meet us in the inner chamber--
let there be no doubt of this in our minds--has no other object than to
fill our hearts with His love...

All the other attributes of God that are mentioned in His Word find in this
their highest glory. The true and full blessing of the inner chamber is
nothing less than a life in the abundant love of God...

Prayer Suggestion:
As you set yourself to pray, pray for a greater faith in His ever-lasting love.
Pray that the precious truth of (I Jn. 2:1) would be a reality in your heart.
"Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us."
