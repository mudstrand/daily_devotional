Todayâ€™s Thought

Why worry when we know who is in charge?

God's Accuracy

God's accuracy may be observed in the hatching of eggs.
For example; 

the eggs of the potato bug hatch in 7 days;
those of the canary in 14 days; 

those of the barnyard hen in 21 days. 

The eggs of ducks and geese hatch in 28 days;
those of the mallard in 35 days. 

The eggs of the parrot and the ostrich hatch in 42 days.
(Notice, they are all divisible by seven).

God's wisdom is seen in the making of an elephant. The
four legs of this great beast all bend forward in the same
direction. No other quadruped is so made. God planned that
this animal would have a huge body, too large to live on two

legs. For this reason He gave it four fulcrums so that it can
rise from the ground easily.

The horse rises from the ground on its two front legs first. 

A cow rises from the ground with its two hind legs first. 

How wise the Lord is in all His works of creation!

God's wisdom is revealed in His arrangement of sections
and segments, as well as in the number of grains.

Each watermelon has an even number of strips on the rind.
Each orange has an even number of segments. 

Each ear of corn has an even number of rows. 

Each stalk of wheat has an even number of grains. 

Every bunch of bananas has on its lowest row an even 

number of bananas, and each row decreases by one, 

so that one row has an even number and the next row 

an odd number. The waves of the sea roll in on shore 

twenty-six to the minute in all kinds of weather.

All grains are found in even numbers on the stalks, 

and the Lord specified thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and a 

hundredfold - all even numbers.



God has caused the flowers to blossom at certain specified
times during the day, so that Linneus, the great botanist,
once said that if he had a conservatory containing the right
kind of soil, moisture and temperature, he could tell the
time of day or night by the flowers that were open and those
that were closed!

Thus the Lord in His wonderful grace can arrange the life
that is entrusted to His care in such a way that it will
carry out His purposes and plans, and will be fragrant with
His presence.


GOD IS LARGE AND HE IS IN CHARGE!!!
