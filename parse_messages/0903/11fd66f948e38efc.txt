Subject: FW: He found me!



When you finish reading the story, copy and google Rev. John Powell, and his story comes up on Google. This is a totally true story. 

This is a really good read!!!!!!!!!

Father John Powell, a professor at Loyola University in Chicago, writes

about a student in his Theology of Faith class named Tommy:



Some twelve years ago, I stood watching my university students file into the

classroom for our first session in the Theology of Faith.

That was the day I first saw Tommy. My eyes and my mind both blinked. He was

combing his long flaxen hair, which hung six inches below his shoulders. It

was the first time I had ever seen a boy with hair that long. I guess it was

just coming into fashion then. I know in my mind that it isn't what's on

your head but what's in it that counts; but on that day I was unprepared and

my emotions flipped. I immediately filed Tommy under "S" for strange... Very

strange.



Tommy turned out to be the "atheist in residence" in my Theology of Faith

course. He constantly objected to, smirked at, or whined about the

possibility of an unconditionally loving Father/God. We lived with each

other in relative peace for one semester, although I admit he was for me at

times a serious pain in the back pew.



When he came up at the end of the course to turn in his final exam, he asked

in a cynical tone, "Do you think I'll ever find God?"



I decided instantly on a little shock therapy. "No!" I said very

emphatically.



"Why not," he responded, "I thought that was the product you were pushing."



I let him get five steps from the classroom door and then called out,

"Tommy! I don't think you'll ever find Him, but I am absolutely certain that

He will find you!" He shrugged a little and left my class and my life.



I felt slightly disappointed at the thought that he had missed my clever

line -- He will find you! At least I thought it was clever



Later I heard that Tommy had graduated, and I was duly grateful.



Then a sad report came. I heard that Tommy had terminal cancer. Before I

could search him out, he came to see me. When he walked into my office, his

body was very badly wasted and the long hair had all fallen out as a result

of chemotherapy. But his eyes were bright and his voice was firm, for the

first time, I believe. "Tommy, I've thought about you so often; I hear you

are sick," I blurted out.



"Oh, yes, very sick. I have cancer in both lungs. It's a matter of weeks."



"Can you talk about it, Tom?" I asked.



"Sure, what would you like to know?" he replied



"What's it like to be only twenty-four and dying?



"Well, it could be worse.



"Like what?



"Well, like being fifty and having no values or ideals, like being fifty and

thinking that booze, seducing women, and making money are the real biggies

in life..



I began to look through my mental file cabinet under "S" where I had filed

Tommy as strange. (It seems as though everybody I try to reject by

classification, God sends back into my life to educate me.)



"But what I really came to see you about," Tom said, "is something you said

to me on the last day of class." (He remembered!) He continued, "I asked you

if you thought I would ever find God and you said, 'No!' which surprised me

Then you said, 'But He will find you.' I thought about that a lot, even

though my search for God was hardly intense at that time.



(My clever line. He thought about that a lot!)



"But when the doctors removed a lump from my groin and told me that it was

malignant, that's when I got serious about locating God. And when the

malignancy spread into my vital organs, I really began banging bloody fists

against the bronze doors of heaven. But God did not come out. In fact,

nothing happened. Did you ever try anything for a long time with great

effort and with no success? You get psychologically glutted, fed up with

trying. And then you quit



"Well, one day I woke up, and instead of throwing a few more futile appeals

over that high brick wall to a God who may be or may not be there, I just

quit. I decided that I didn't really care about God, about an after life, or

anything like that. I decided to spend what time I had left doing something

more profitable. I thought about you and your class and I remembered

something else you had said: 'The essential sadness is to go through life

without loving. But it would be almost equally sad to go through life and

leave this world without ever telling those you loved that you had loved

them.'"





"So, I began with the hardest one, my Dad. He was reading the newspaper when

I approached him. "Dad.



"Yes, what?" he asked without lowering the newspaper.



"Dad, I would like to talk with you."



"Well, talk.



"I mean . It's really important."



The newspaper came down three slow inches. "What is it?"

"Dad, I love you, I just wanted you to know that." Tom smiled at me and said

it with obvious satisfaction, as though he felt a warm and secret joy

flowing inside of him. "The newspaper fluttered to the floor. Then my father

did two things I could never remember him ever doing before. He cried and he

hugged me. We talked all night, even though he had to go to work the next

morning. It felt so good to be close to my father, to see his tears, to feel

his hug, to hear him say that he loved me."



"It was easier with my mother and little brother. They cried with me, too,

and we hugged each other, and started saying real nice things to each other.

We shared the things we had been keeping secret for so many years.



"I was only sorry about one thing --- that I had waited so long. Here I was,

just beginning to open up to all the people I had actually been close to.



"Then, one day I turned around and God was there. He didn't come to me when

I pleaded with Him. I guess I was like an animal trainer holding out a hoop,

'C'mon, jump through. C'mon, I'll give you three days, three weeks.'"



"Apparently God does things in His own way and at His own hour. But the

important thing is that He was there. He found me! You were right. HE FOUND

ME even after I stopped looking for Him."



"Tommy," I practically gasped, "I think you are saying something very

important and much more universal than you realize. To me, at least, you are

saying that the surest way to find God is not to make Him a private

possession, a problem solver, or an instant consolation in time of need, but

rather by opening to love. You know, the Apostle John said that. He said:

'God is love, and anyone who lives in love is living with God and God is

living in him.' Tom, could I ask you a favor? You know, when I had you in

class you were a real pain. But (laughingly) you can make it all up to me

now. Would you come into my present Theology of Faith course and tell them

what you have just told me? If I told them the same thing it wouldn't be

half as effective as if you were to tell it.

"Oooh.. I was ready for you, but I don't know if I'm ready for your class."



"Tom, think about it. If and when you are ready, give me a call."



In a few days Tom called, said he was ready for the class, that he wanted to

do that for God and for me. So we scheduled a date.



However, he never made it. He had another appointment, far more important

than the one with me and my class. Of course, his life was not really ended

by his death, only changed. He made the great step from faith into vision.

He found a life far more beautiful than the eye of man has ever seen or the

ear of man has ever heard or the mind of man has ever imagined.

Before he died, we talked one last time.



"I'm not going to make it to your class," he said.



"I know, Tom."



"Will you tell them for me? Will you ... tell the whole world for me?"



I will, Tom. I'll tell them. I'll do my best."



So, to all of you who have been kind enough to read this simple story about

God's love, thank you for listening. And to you, Tommy, somewhere in the

sunlit, verdant hills of heaven --- I told them, Tommy, as best I could.



If this story means anything to you, please pass it on to a friend or two.

It is a true story and is not enhanced for publicity purposes.



With thanks, Rev. John Powell, Professor, Loyola University, Chicago
