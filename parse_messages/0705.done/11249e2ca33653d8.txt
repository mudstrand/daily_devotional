GOD'S COFFEE



A group of alumni, highly established in their careers, got together
to visit their old university professor. Conversation soon turned into
complaints about stress in work and life.

Offering his guests coffee, the professor went to the kitchen and returned 
with a large pot
of coffee and an assortment of cups - porcelain, plastic, glass crystal, 
some plain looking,
some expensive , some exquisite - telling them to help themselves to the 
coffee.

When all the students had a cup of coffee in hand, the professor said:
"If you noticed, all the nice looking expensive cups were taken up,
leaving behind the plain and cheap ones. While it is normal for you
to want only the best for yourselves, that is the source of your problems
and stress.

Be assured that the cup itself adds no quality to the coffee. In most cases 
it is just
more expensive and in some cases even hides what we drink.

What all of you really wanted was coffee, not the cup, but you consciously 
went for
the best cups... And then you began eyeing each other's cups.

Now consider this: Life is the coffee; the jobs, money and position in
society are the cups. They are just tools to hold and contain Life,
and the type of cup we have does not define, nor change the quality of
Life we live.

Sometimes, by concentrating only on the cup, we fail to enjoy the
coffee God has provided us."

God brews the coffee, not the cups.......... Enjoy your coffee!
"The happiest people don't have the best of everything. T

hey just make the best of everything."

Live simply. Love generously. Care deeply. Speak kindly. Leave the
rest to God.
