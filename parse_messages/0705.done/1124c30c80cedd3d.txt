Our Meditation for Today:

Pray for us. We are sure that we have a clear conscience
and desire to live honorably in every way...

I particularly urge you to pray so that I may be restored to 
you soon...(Heb. 13:18, 19) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

The writer here recognizes the need for prayer...

Christian leaders are especially vulnerable to criticism from others, 
pride (if they succeed), depression (if they fail), and Satan's constant
efforts to destroy their work for God...

They desperately need our prayers!

Think for a minute, for whom should you regularly pray???

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for the avenue of prayer.
There are many whom need our prayers but so often we
are so concerned about our own little problems that we forget
to pray for those who really need our prayers. Forgive me
Lord for this sin of omission...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
