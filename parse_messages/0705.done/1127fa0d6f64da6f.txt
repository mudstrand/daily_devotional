HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Always be open to God's leading...

Our Meditation for Today:

I am obligated both to the Greeks and non-Greeks, 
both the wise and to the foolish...(Ro. 1:14) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Like with Paul, there should be an urgent compulsion
in the heart of every believer to bring the Gospel to
everyone regardless of their differences....

It should be our burning desire to bring the knowledge
of our Lord's salvation to as many as possible regardless 
of their stature or station in life...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to always be faithful in
sharing the Gospel with all who will listen. Instill in me a 
sense of urgency in the need to share Your Word...Amen.

Keep looking Up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
