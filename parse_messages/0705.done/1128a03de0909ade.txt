HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought~~~The beneficiaries of the Gospel are those who believe...

Our Meditation for Today:

I am not ashamed of the Gospel: it is the power of God for salvation 
to everyone who has faith, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
(Ro. 1:16)

Our Thought for Today:

There are many who regard the Gospel of Jesus Christ as foolishness.
To be identified as a witness of the Gospel means that one may be
counted as foolish, and persecution may follow...

Paul knew the consequences of this identity with the Gospel and he was
not ashamed...

The Gospel of Christ demands unconditional surrender of the intellect and
the will. Of course this is not pleasing to the nature of man. the independence
that he loves so much is threatened. The Gospel is not loved by the unbelieving 
world...

The main reason for Paul's boldness regarding the Gospel was that, "it is the
power of God for salvation." The benefit of this power is received by "everyone
who has faith."

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, give me the boldness and the wisdom
to share the Gospel with those who regard it as foolishness.
I pray that there would be a revival in the world, and let it start
with me. Bless and protect my e-mail friends today...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
