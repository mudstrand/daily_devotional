HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Coincidence is when God chooses to remain anonymous...

Our Meditation for Today:

May the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal
covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that 
great Shepherd of the sheep,

equip you with everything good for doing His will, and may He 
work in us what is pleasing to Him, through Jesus Christ, to
whom be glory for ever and ever...Amen. (Heb. 13:20, 21) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

What we should see is that these verses include two significant 
results of Christ's death and resurrection...

God works in us to make us the kind of people that would please
Him, and He equips us to do the kind of work that would please
Him...

So let God change you from within and then use you to help others...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the results that were
brought about by Christ's death and His resurrection. I pray 
that I would allow You to work in my heart that my life would
be pleasing to You. I pray that I would allow You to use me 
as You wish...

Bless and keep my e-mail friends healthy and safe...Amen.

Keep Looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care... 
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
