Good morning!
We can pretend we are sharing a good cup of coffee (or tea, or Diet Coke or Diet Dr Pepper), while enjoying....

Good Morning Blessings

If it stops with you, then the blessing will disappear. The blessing will only keep working if it is continuously passed around. If you are a recipient of a blessing, keep the blessing working by being the source of blessing to other people.

Good Morning !!!!

This morning when I wakened 
And saw the sun above, 
I softly said, "Good morning, Lord, 
Bless everyone I love"



Right away I thought of you 
And said a loving prayer, 
That He would bless you specially, 
And keep you free from care. 



I thought of all the happiness 
A day could hold in store, 
I wished it all for you because 
No one deserves it more. 

I felt so warm and good inside, 
My heart was all aglow. 
I know God heard my prayers for you, 
He hears them all, you know. 

You have two choices...smile and close this page 
Or pass this along to someone else to spread the good feelings. 
I know what I did!! 
HAVE A BLESSING GOOD DAY
