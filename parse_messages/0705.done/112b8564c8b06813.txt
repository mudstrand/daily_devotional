HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~The reason evil enters the lives of many is that, 
there is no commitment to do good...

Our Meditation for Today:

Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain 
the knowledge of God, He gave them over to a depraved 
mind, to do what ought not be done...

They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, 
evil greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, 
strife, deceit, and malice. 

They are gossips, slanders, God-haters, Insolent, arrogant 
and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey 
their parents;

they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.

Although they know God's righteous decree that those who 
do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do
these very things but also approve of those who practice them.
(Ro. 1:28-32) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Approving wrong identifies the one who approves with the ungodly.
Those who do this give evidence of the law of sin that is at work
within them...

Defending sin, as the unregenerate defend their wrongdoing, is an
indication of rebellion against God. The consequences is that rebellion
brings the judgement of God, and the wrath of God will rest upon
ungodliness...

But repentant ones are willing to flee into the city of refuge, through the 
narrow gate, to be cleansed by the atoning blood of Christ...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, we often point our fingers at the
sins of others, but help us to be mindful that in Your
eyes sin is sin, there is not one sin better or worse than 
another. So Lord I thank You for the atoning blood of 
Jesus Christ for all sin...Amen.

Keep looking up, for every good thing comes from God...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
