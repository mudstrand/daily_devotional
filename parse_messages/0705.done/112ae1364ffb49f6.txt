HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~We are to give God the glory that is due Him...

Our Meditation for Today:

Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts
to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.

They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served
created things rather then the creator, who is forever praised...Amen.
(Ro. 1:24, 25) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

These words reveal the consequences of refusing to follow
the gospel light that has been offered by our Lord...

He simply leaves such stubborn ones to the lists of their own
hearts. Powers of evil are so overwhelming to man that if the 
Lord forsakes him he will be immersed in all manner of sin and
shame...

If God did not check this deluge there could be no social order 
in existence. Even where the powers of grace are hindered God 
has provided checks against the destruction that wickedness causes.

Some of these checks are common sense, fear of shame, fear of
injury, and a desire for self-respect. But when the judgment of God
is directed against gross wrongs of mankind He withholds the checks 
against the outbreak of sin...

SO!!! Let us always give God the glory that is due Him...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that Your Holy Spirit will one 
day awaken these wayward ones, that they would turn from 
the lusts of their hearts. Help me to be mindful the give You
the honor that is due You. Place your protective hand upon
our troops--and my e-mail friends...Amen.

Keep looking up, seeking His gracious will...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
