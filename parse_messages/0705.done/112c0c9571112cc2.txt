CITGO CHANGING NAME..this is serious Americans...make sure you read

NEWS FLASH:

Chavez is NOW getting a Russian Weapons Factory built by Putin.

The RUSSIANS are building an AK-47 Kalashnikov Assault Rifle factory in 
Venezuela, to give armament support to Communist Rebel groups throughout the 
Americas

Chavez NOW has IRANIANS operating his oil refineries in Venezuela for him.

It is likely only a matter of time, if not already, before Chavez has 
Iranian built LONG RANGE missiles, with a variety of warhead types aimed at: 
Guess Who?

CITGO is NOW in the process of Changing Its Name to PETRO EXPRESS due to the 
loss of gasoline sales in the USA due to the recent publicity of ownership 
by Chavez of Venezuela.

Every dollar you spend with CITGO or PETRO EXPRESS gasoline will be used 
against you, your basic human rights, and your freedoms.

He will start wars here in the Americas that will probably be the death of 
millions of free people.

THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT because Chavez is starting to feel the loss of 
revenue from his holdings.

HE OWNS CITGO.

This is a very important move that everyone should be aware of.

ANNOUNCED JUST RECENTLY, CITGO, BEING AWARE THAT SALES ARE DOWN DUE TO U.S. 
CUSTOMERS NOT WANTING TO BUY FROM "CITGO-CHAVEZ", HAVE STARTED TO
CHANGE THE NAME OF SOME OF THEIR STORES TO: "PETRO EXPRESS"

DO NOT BUY FROM "PETRO EXPRESS" EITHER!!!

"PETRO EXPRESS" IS ALSO 100% OWNED BY "CHAVEZ."

KEEP THIS MEMO GOING SO THAT EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT IS HAPPENING.

BOYCOTT "CITGO" AND "PETRO EXPRESS".............

MAKE SURE THIS IS PASSED ON TO EVERYONE IN YOUR E-MAIL LIST IN THE UNITED 
STATES AND OUTSIDE OF AMERICA!!!!!!!
