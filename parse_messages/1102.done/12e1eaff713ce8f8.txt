Our Bible Verses for Today:
3 John 1:

2 Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, 
even as your soul is getting along well. 
3 It gave me great joy when some believers came and testified about your faithfulness 
to the truth, telling how you continue to walk in it. 
4 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth. 

Our Lesson for Today:
Our confidence is that our Heavenly Father is on our side at all times,
no matter what suffering we face. He sent His Son Jesus as our great 
physician to heal us from all sin and the afflictions we experience in a
sin-broken world. . .

He grants faith that is active in love for our brethren and for the truth. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, grant that I may walk by faith in Jesus Christ
and in the truth of Your Word. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
