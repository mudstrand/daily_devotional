Our Verse for Today:
"For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, 
love and self-discipline." - 2 Timothy 1:7 

Our Lesson for Today:
The sending of the Holy Spirit, who equips people for Jesus' 
missions. . .

The Holy Spirit's power makes our witness effective. Luth: "Its as if 
he would say, I'll place armor on you that will withstand every shot.' "

Self-discipline ~ Self-control ~ You cannot control the length of
your life - but you can control its width and depth. You cannot control
the contour of your face - but you can control its expression. You
cannot control the weather - but you can control the atmosphere of 
your mind. . .

Why should we worry about things we cannot control when we can keep
ourselves busy controlling the things that depend on us?

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to not be so concern about the things
I have no control over, give me the power to focus on that 
which I can control. . .Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
