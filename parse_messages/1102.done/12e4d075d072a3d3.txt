02/ 22/2011~~~food for thought~~~STEADFAST LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE (Ps 63:3)

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"The commandments, "You shall not commit adultery," "You shall not murder," 
"You shall not steal," "You shall not covet," and whatever other command there 
may be, are summed up in this one command: "Love your neighbor as yourself." 
Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law." - Romans 13:9-10 

Our Lesson for Today:
What Paul is doing is encouraging the regenerate to do good works, he clearly 
presents them with the 10 Commandments. Then he adds "Love your neighbor."

Jesus similarly identifies this as an apt summary of the Law (Mt. 22:37-40). . .
How can this be? It is because love is to place another person before self;
this is to be a "living sacrifice."

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, You have loved me in Christ and declared me
to be Your righteous child. Empower me to love and serve
others through Christ. . .Amen

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14
