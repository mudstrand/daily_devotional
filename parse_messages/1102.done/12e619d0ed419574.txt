I am sending this note below recently sent to me. Also, we learned
as you may already know that an abortion clinic in Duluth did at
least 600 abortions there last year. Also, churches are starting to
raise funds for women to have abortions. Seems always a new twist
comes along right along.

I don't usually sent "issues " request but this needs prayer !

Washington D.C. (February 23rd, 2011) -- The following is a statement from
Andrea Lafferty, executive director of Traditional Values Coalition,
on President Obama's decision not to enforce the Defense of Marriage Act
by executive decree:

"The Obama Administration has been sabotaging marriage in direct
contradiction to his campaign promises. Today, President Obama takes
his most unprecedented step yet, choosing to rule and reign through
executive decree in what could only be called a supra-constitutional act.
After massive defeats at the polls in November, a total repudiation on
health care, and staring down a cost-cutting Congress, Obama is looking
to secure what little base remains. Obama's actions today are an 
unprecedented
grab for power and perhaps the most audacious in the 235 year history of
the American republic.

"President Obama believes he has "concluded" that the Defense of Marriage
Act is unconstitutional, as passed along by Attorney General Eric Holder --
effectively asserting that Obama may rule by whim and decree.

"We are a nation of laws, not whims.

"Virtually every state in the country has overwhelmingly passed laws
and state constitutional amendments protecting marriage. This
unprecedented power grab demands the immediate reaction of the
United States House of Representatives, who must do everything possible
to fight back against what can only be described as a despotic and alarming
attack on the rule of law."
