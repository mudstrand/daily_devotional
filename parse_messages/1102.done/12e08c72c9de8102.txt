Our Bible Verses for To Day:
"[Love for Enemies] "You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' 
But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children 
of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the 
righteous and the unrighteous." - Matthew 5:43-45 

Our Lesson for Today:
"love your enemies" ~ What Jesus commands is not about emotions but as loving actions.
Remember when Jesus Himself was stripped, beaten and blasphemed by the soldiers,
scribes, Pharisees, officers and priests not even then did He pronounce any maliciousness 
against them. . .

Do you remember what He did and said? He prayed, saying: "Father forgive them."

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, though I often fall short of Your perfection,
forgive my sins for Jesus sake, and strengthen me for greater service
and love for my fellow man. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
