02/27/2011~~~food for thought~~~THE WORD BECAME FLESH ~ AND DWELT AMONG US

Our Verse for Today:
"This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and 
only Son into the world that we might live through him." - 1 John 4:9 

Our Lesson for Today:
The important part of this verse is that the Son came that the
believer might"live through Him." How is this possible? It
is because He died, rose, and ascended into heaven so that
He might fulfil all things (Eph. 4:10). . .

He is present with all believers through His chosen means of
grace; His Word, Holy Baptism, and the Lord's Supper. The
Word made flesh is our source of life, our mediator, we live
only because of Him, as Jesus Himself taught (Jn. 6:57).

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, thank You bearing all my sins on the cross
so that I might inherit eternal life. Help me to remain
faithful in my walk with You. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
