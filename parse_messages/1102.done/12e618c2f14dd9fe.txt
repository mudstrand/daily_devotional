Our Verses for Today:
"Jesus replied: "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul 
and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second 
is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'" - Matthew 22:37-39 

The Lesson for Today:
You can find this recorded first in Deut. 6:5 ~ 
You can also find it in Lev.19 under the Holiness Code. . .

In Mt. 22:36 we see that a lawyer, ask Jesus, "Which is the great 
commandment in the Law?" And we see His reply in vss. 37-39 ~ 

Significantly, Jesus' answer is thoroughly traditional. But many say: 
"Oh, that is utterly impossible for a person to keep these two commandments. 
Yes I agree, it is impossible for you to keep or perform them. 
You can't do it; ~ God must do it in you, ~ for Him it is possible. . .

Seek His power daily to keep this command. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Most Gracious Lord, Your almighty power is made known chiefly 
in showing mercy and pity. Grant me the grace to lay hold of your 
promises and live forever in Your presence; through Jesus Christ. . . Amen. 
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
