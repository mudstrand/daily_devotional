Keeper
***************
I grew up in the 60's/70's with practical parents. A mother, God love her, 
who washed aluminum foil after she cooked in it, then reused it. She was the 
original recycle queen, before they had a name for it... A father who was 
happier getting old shoes fixed than buying new ones.

Their marriage was good, their dreams focused. Their best friends lived 
barely a wave away..

I can see them now, Dad in trousers, tee shirt and a hat and Mum in a house 
dress, lawn mower in one hand, and dish-towel in the other. It was the time 
for fixing things. A curtain rod, the kitchen radio, screen door, the oven 
door, the hem in a dress. Things we keep.

It was a way of life, and sometimes it made me crazy. All that re-fixing, 
eating, renewing, I wanted just once to be wasteful. Waste meant affluence. 
Throwing things away meant you knew there'd always be more.

But then my mother died, and on that clear summer's night, in the warmth of 
the hospital room, I was struck with the pain of learning that sometimes 
there isn't any more.

Sometimes, what we care about most gets all used up and goes away....never 
to return.. So... While we have it..... it's best we love it.... And care 
for it... And fix it when it's broken........ And heal it when it's sick.
This is true. For friends..... And old cars.... And children with bad report 
cards..... And dogs with bad hips..... And aging parents..... And 
grandparents. We keep them because they are worth it, because we are worth 
it. Some things we keep. Like a best friend that moved away or a classmate 
we grew up with.

There are just some things that make life important, like people we know who 
are special........ And so, we keep them close!

I received this from someone who thinks I am a 'keeper', so I've sent it to 
the people I think of in the same way.... Now it's your turn to send this to 
those people that are "keepers" in your life. Good friends are like 
stars.... You don't always see them, but you know they are always there. 
Keep them close!
