02/07/2011~~~food for thought~~~GOD APPROVES OF FORESIGHT AND RESTRAINT

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Proverbs 21:20 
20 The wise store up choice food and olive oil, 
but fools gulp theirs down. 

Our Lesson for Today:
This lesson is really about saving for the future.

Easy credit today has caused many people to live on the edge of bankruptcy.
The desire to keep up appearances and the desire to accumulate more drives 
many people to spend every penny they earn, and they stretch their credit to
the limit. . .

But anyone who spends all he has is spending more than he can afford.
But a wise person puts money aside for hard times. God approves of
foresight and restraint. . .

A wise person needs to examine his/her life-style to see whether their 
spending is God-pleasing or merely self-pleasing. . .

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Dear Lord, keep my eyes always focused on You
and Your blessing, which are mine by grace alone. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
