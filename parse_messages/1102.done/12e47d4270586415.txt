02/21/2011~~~food for thought~~~LOVE COVERS A MULTITUDE OF SINS

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Hatred stirs up conflict, but 
love covers over all wrongs. Proverbs 10:12 
A perverse person stirs up conflict, 
and a gossip separates close friends. Proverbs 16:28

"Whoever would foster love covers over an offense, but whoever 
repeats the matter separates close friends." - Proverbs 17:9 

Our Lesson for Today:
What we should learn from these three verses is that "love" covers
all offenses. Speaking words of hatred only escalates strife, but 
words of forgiveness, prompted by love brings righteousness. . .

Even though offenses occur love will overlook, forgive and yields to
them, not carrying all things to the extremity of justice.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I pray that Your saving love and forgiveness
will always be expressed through my lips. . .Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
