02/15/2011~~~food for thought~~~LET US BE IMITATORS OF HIS LOVE

Our Bible Verses for Today:
""A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, 
so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are 
my disciples, if you love one another."" - John 13:34-35 

Our Lesson for Today:
God had previously commanded His people to love others, even at some cost,
but Jesus' sacrificial love sets a far higher standard than anything before. The 
disciples cannot follow Christ to the cross, but He asks them to imitate His love 
for them as they love one another. . .

We, as Christians bring dishonor to Christ and His love when we deal with one 
another in a loveless manner. Christ redeemed us through His self-sacrificial
love that we may in turn imitate His love. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
May Your love, O Lord, guide my every action. . .Amen. 

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather
The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
