02/12/2011~~~food for thought~~~LOVE COMES FROM A PURE HEART

Our Bible Verses for Today:
1 Corinthians 13:4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 
5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 
6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 
7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres

The Lesson to be Learned:

We see by these verses that they are poetically balanced between negative 
and positive statements. There are fifteen assertions which describe the 
nature of love in Christ:

Two positive statements, eight negative statements (the last one adds a positive contrast),
then four positive statements. . . 

The first assertions are most important ("patient," "kind"). If you are wondering about God's 
attributes, look to (Ex. 34:6). . .

The all important, 'lesson to be learned,' for me is:
"Love is patient, love is kind." If we strive to live by these two rules,
all that negative stuff will have no place in our lives. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me not only hear Your Word but also to keep it
in a pure heart, that it may produce a faithful life of service. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
