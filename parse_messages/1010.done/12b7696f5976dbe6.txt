10/04/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE VISION OF REALITY

Our Bible Verse for Today:
". . .To those who are . . . called to be saints. . ." (I Cor. 1:2)

Our Lesson for Today:
Don't we find that a personal invitation makes us feel wanted and welcome?

Here we are "called by God to be His own holy people." God personally invites 
us to be citizens of His Kingdom. But let us remember Jesus Christ, God's Son,
is the only one who can bring us into His glorious Kingdom because He is the only 
One who removes our sins. . .

We can only accept God's invitation by accepting His Son, Jesus Christ, and by
trusting in the work He did on the cross to forgive our sins. . .

Remember, God knows where we live, but He also knows the gutters into which 
we crawl! He will hunt us down as fast as a flash of lightening. . .

Here is a thought to remember, (No human being knows human beings as God does.)

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, there is nothing I can hide. You know me
through and through, here I stand sins and all without
one excuse, please forgive my sins, known and unknown. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
