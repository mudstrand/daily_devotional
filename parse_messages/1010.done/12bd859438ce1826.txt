Our Bible Verse for Today:
If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed
away; behold all things have become new." (II Cor. 5:17)

Our Lesson for Today:
When we are born again, the Holy Spirit begins to work His new creation
in us, and there will come a time when there is nothing remaining of the
old life. Our old gloomy outlook disappears, as does our old attitude
toward things, and: ~ "all things are of God" (II Cor. 5:8)

How are we going to get a life that has no lust, no self-interest, and is not
sensitive to the ridicule of others? ~ How will we have the type of love that 
"is kind ~ is not provoked, and thinks no evil"? (I Cor. 13:4, 5)

The only way is by allowing nothing of the old life to remain, and by having 
only simple, perfect trust in God ~ such a trust that we no longer want God's 
blessing, but only want God Himself. . .

Have we come to the point where God can withdraw His blessings from us
without our trust in Him being affected? Once we truly see God at work, we 
will never be concerned again about the things that happen, because we are 
actually trusting in our Father in heaven, whom the world cannot see. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to turn from my old ways, and put my
total trust in You alone. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
