This is by a daughter of a murdered couple in Raytown , MO , 
Who had a Bible and Bookstore on 63rd street ..


When I had to testify at the murder trial of my parents a week ago, 
I was asked to raise my right hand... The bailiff started out 
"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?" 

I stood there and waited but she said nothing. She said "Do you?"

I was so stunned I blurted out "What happened to "so help me God'?" 

She came back with "Do you?" I replied yes, but I was perplexed. 

Then the judge said .. "You can say that if you want to." 

I stopped, raised my right hand, and finished with "So help me God!" 

I told my son and daughter that when it came time for them to testify, they should do the same. 


I don't know what can be done about it, but it's time for us to step up and DO something. 

NBC this morning had a poll on this question.. They had the highest number of responses 
that they have ever had for one of their polls, and the percentage was the same as this: 

86% to keep the words, 14% against.. That is a pretty 'commanding' public response. 

I was asked to send this on if I agreed or delete if I didn't. 

Now it is your turn.. It is said that 86% of Americans believe in God. 

Therefore, I have a very hard time understanding why there is such a mess about having 
"In God We Trust" on our money and having God in the Pledge of Allegiance. 

Why is the world catering to this 14%? 

If you agree, pass this on, if not, simply delete.... 
IN GOD WE TRUST 

AS TO THE 14% who don't like the phrase? used in court? being on their money? They can send it all to me, I LOVE IT!

AGREE OR DELETE 



If You Choose To Delete 
Perhaps Then You Are Part Of The Problem 

Me? I'm Passing It On. 
It seems to get worse daily.
