10/10/2010~~~food for thought~~~HOW WILL WE KNOW?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Jesus answered and said, "I thank You, Father . . . that you have hidden 
these things from the wise and prudent and have revealed them to babes"
(Mt. 11:25)

Our Lesson for Today:
All of God's revealed truths are sealed until they are opened to us through 
obedience. We will never open them through philosophy or thinking. But
once we obey, a flash of light comes immediately. Let us let God's truth work
into us by immersing ourselves in it, not by worrying about it. . .

The only way we can get to know the truth of God is to stop trying to find out 
and by being born again. If we obey God in the first thing He shows us,
then He instantly opens up the next truth to us. . .

We could read volumes on the work of the Holy Spirit, when five minutes of 
total, uncompromising obedience would make things as clear as sunshine. . .

Don't say, "I suppose I will understand these things someday!" You can 
understand them now. And it is not study that brings understanding to you, 
but obedience. Even the smallest bit of obedience opens heaven, and the 
deepest truths of God immediately become yours. . .

But for further truths we need to obey what we have learned already.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to put into practice the truths 
You have made known onto me. . .Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
