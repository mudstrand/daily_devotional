10/27/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE METHOD OF MISSIONS

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations. . ." (Mt. 28:19)

Our Lesson for Today:
LISTEN ~ Jesus did not say, "Go save souls" (the salvation of souls
is the supernatural work of God). . . What Jesus said was "Go. . .make
disciples of all nations. . ." BUT you cannot make disciples unless you
are a disciple yourself. . .

When the disciples returned from their first mission, we are told they were
filled with joy because even the demons were subject to them. But Jesus
said, in effect, "Don't rejoice in successful service, the great secret of joy 
is that you have the right relationship with Me." (see Lk. 10:17-20)

A missionary's most important essential is remaining true to the call of God, 
and realizing that his one and only purpose is to disciple men and women to 
Jesus. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, Help me to have the right relationship with you, 
so that I do not to get in the way of Your work. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
