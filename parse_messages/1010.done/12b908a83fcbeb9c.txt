10/09/2010~~~food for thought~~~BUILDING ON THE ATONEMENT

Our Bible Verse for Today:
". . . Present . . . your members as instruments of 
righteousness to God." (Ro. 6:13)

Our Lesson for Today:
Let us remember, we cannot save or sanctify ourselves. . .
We cannot make atonement for sin; we cannot redeem the world;
We cannot make right what is wrong, purify what is impure, or
make holy what is unholy. . .

That is all the sovereign work of God. . . Do I have faith in what 
Jesus Christ has done? ~ He has made the perfect atonement for
sin. . . Am I in the habit of constantly realizing it?

The greatest need we have is not to do things, but to believe things.
The redemption of Christ is not an experience, it is the great act of 
God which He has performed through Christ, and we have to build
our faith on it. . .

If we construct our faith on our own experience, we produce the most 
unscriptural kind of life ~ an isolated life, with our eyes focused solely
on our own holiness. Let us beware of that human holiness that is
not based on the atonement of the Lord. . .

Prayer Suggestion.
Dear Lord, Help me to build on the atonement,
purchased by Christ. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
