Our Bible Verse for Today:
". . . I say to you, he who believes in Me, . . .
greater works than these he will do, because
I go to My Father." (Jn. 14:12)

Our Lesson for Today:
Before your feathers get ruffled, about what I'm about to say read on
and think ~ think seriously. . .

Prayer does not equip us for greater work ~ prayer is the greater work.
Yet we think of prayer as some commonsense exercise of our higher
power that simply prepares us for God's work. . .

In the teachings of Jesus Christ, prayer is the working of the miracle
of redemption in others, through the power of God. The way fruit remains 
firm is through prayer, ~ but remember that it is prayer based on the
agony of Christ in redemption, not on our agony. . .

We must go to God as His child, because only a child gets his prayers
answered; a wise man does not (see Mt. 11:25). . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Help me Lord never to shirk my duty as a prayer warrior. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
