10/07/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE VICTORY HAS BEEN WON

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Here on earth you will have many trials and sorrows, but 
take heart, because I have overcome the world. (Jn. 16:33b)

Our Lesson for Today:
In spite of the inevitable struggles we will face, remember we are not alone.
Jesus does not abandon us in our struggles. Let us also remember that the
ultimate victory has already been won so let us avoid these mistakes. . .

1. Remorse over yesterday's failure.
2. Anxiety over today's problems.
3. Worry over tomorrow's uncertainty.
4. Procrastination with one's present duty.
5. Resentment of another's success.
6. Criticism of a neighbor's imperfections.
7. Impatience with youth's imperfection.
8. Skepticism of our nations future.
9. Unbelief in God's providence.

Instead let us claim the peace of Christ in the most troublesome times. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I am guilty of all the fore mentioned mistakes,
help me to gain the peace of Christ, remembering He is 
always at my side. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
