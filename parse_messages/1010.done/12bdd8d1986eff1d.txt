10/24/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE PROPER PERSPECTIVE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ. . ."
(II Cor. 2:14)

Our Lesson for Today:
The proper perspective of a servant of God must not simply be as near 
to the highest as he/she can get, but it must be the highest. Be careful
to vigorously maintain God's perspective, and remember that it must be 
done every day, little by little. . .

The proper perspective to maintain is that we are here for only one purpose,
to be captives marching in the procession of Christ's triumphs. . .

We are not on display in God's showcase ~ we are here to exhibit only one
thing - the "captivity [of our lives] to the obedience of Christ" (II Cor. 10:5).

No outside power can touch the proper perspective. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord,Help me to always maintain the proper
perspective. . .Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
