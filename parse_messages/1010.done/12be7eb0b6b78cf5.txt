10/26/2010~~~food for thought~~~WHAT IS A MISSIONARY?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Jesus said to them again, ". . . As the Father has sent me,
I also send you." (Jn. 20:21)

Our Lesson for Today:
A missionary is someone sent by Jesus Christ just as He was sent by God.
The great controlling factor is not the needs of the people, but the command 
of Jesus. The source of our inspiration in our service to God is behind us, not 
ahead of us. . .

The tendency today is to put the inspiration out in front ~ to sweep everything 
together in front of us and make it conform to our definition of success. But in
the New Testament the inspiration is put behind us, and is the Lord Jesus Himself.

The goal is to be true to Him ~ to carry out His plans. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to stay true to Your plans. . . Amen. 
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
