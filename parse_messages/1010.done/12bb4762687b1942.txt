10/16/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE KEY TO BEING THE MASTER'S LABORER

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into
the harvest field. (Mt. 9:38)

Our Lesson for Today:
From Jesus Christ's perspective, there are no nations, but only the world.
How many of us pray without regard to persons, but with regard to only one
person ~ Jesus Christ?

He owns the harvest that is produced through distress and through conviction 
of sin. ~ This is the harvest for which we have to pray that laborers be sent out 
to reap. . . We stay busy with different things, while people all around us are
ripe and ready to be harvested; ~ we do not reap even one of them, ~ but
simply waste our Lord's time in over-energized activities and programs. . .

Suppose a crisis were to come into one of your families lives ~ are you there 
as a laborer to reap the harvest for Christ? 

Every Christian is called to be Jesus Christ's own, "a servant [who] is not greater 
than his Master" (Jn. 13:16), and someone who does not dictate to Jesus what he 
intends to do. ~ "Pray to the Lord of the harvest," and He will engineer your circumstance
to send you out as His laborer. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, give me a sensitive heart and spirit to
recognize the need of a laborer even where I am at. . . Amen. 
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
