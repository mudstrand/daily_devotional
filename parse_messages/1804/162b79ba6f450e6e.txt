VERSE FOR TODAY:

_"A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech,_

_therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly, in a moment he will_

_be broken beyond healing." _(Pro. 6:12, 15)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

Solomon labels the deceptive person as one who is good for nothing

and whose mouth is corrupt. The corrupt speech here could include

slander gossip, misrepresentation, or schemes that call for fast talk

with skilled deception. We should never play the role of a judge, we

need to leave that role up to God.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Lord, I seek Your forgiveness, because it seems to be easy to

talk about other people in our conversations, which is less then

complementary. Help me to leave the role of judging up to You. . .
Amen.
