VERSE FOR TODAY:

_"If you have co-signed a loan for a friend or guaranteed a debt _

_of someone you hardly know, if you have trapped yourself and _

_are caught by what you said, quick, get out of it if you possibly _

_can! You have placed yourself at your friend's mercy. _(Pro. 6:1,
3a)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

These verses are not a plea against generosity, but against over-

extending one's financial resources, which could lead to your own

poverty. It is important to maintain a balance between generosity

and good stewardship. God wants us to help our friends and the

needy, but He does not promise to cover the costs of every unwise

commitment we make.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Lord I thank You for the wise counsel of these verses, may

I always be prudent and follow Your counsel. . . Amen.
