VERSE FOR TODAY:

_"According to the eternal purpose which He accomplished _

_in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and_

_access with confidence through faith in Him." _(Eph. 3:11-12)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

It is an awesome privilege to be able to approach God with

freedom and confidence. It goes without saying that most of

us would be apprehensive in the presence of a powerful ruler.

But thanks to Christ, by faith we can enter directly into God's

presence through prayer. We know we will be welcomed with

open arms, because we are God's children through our union

with Christ. Don't be afraid of God, talk to Him about everything.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your love and acceptance,

allowing me a sinner to approach You a holy God with my every

request without any fear. . . Amen.
