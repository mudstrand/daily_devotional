VERSE FOR TODAY:

_"Remember that at one time you were separate from Christ;_

_but now in Christ Jesus you who were formerly far off have_

_been brought _ near by the blood of Christ." (Eph. 2:12a, 13)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

This is what God has done, we have been brought near by the blood

of Christ NOT by the sincerity of our repentance, NOT by the strength

of our faith, NOT by the depth of our devotion, NOT by the joy of our

spiritual experience. A new relationship has been sealed with the

sacrificial blood of Christ. . .

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Lord, I cannot begin to put into human terms my thankfulness

for the new relationship I now have with You because of Your death

upon the cross, hELP ME to remain in this new relationship. . . Amen.
