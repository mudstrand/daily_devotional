VERSE FOR TODAY:

_"Those who bring trouble on their families inherit only the _

_wind. the fool will be a servant to the wise." _(Pro. 11:29)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

One of the greatest resources God gives us is the family. Families

provide acceptance, encouragement, guidance, and counsel. Bringing

trouble on your family-----whether through anger or through an

exaggerated desire for independence----is foolish because you cut

yourself off from all they provide. In your family strive for
healing,

communication, and understanding.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

I thank You Lord, for all that You provide for us, forgive me when

I take the many blessing for granted, and not give You thanks as I

should. I thank You Lord for the freedoms we have in this country

I pray in Jesus name. . . Amen.
