12/25/09~~~food for thought~~~THE PREFECT GIFT...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Thanks be to God for His indescribable Gift! (II Cor. 9:15)

Our Lesson for Today:
Once in a while we hear about the perfect gift for someone who has everything.
BUT, what about the perfect gift for someone who has nothing and needs everything?
That's what God gave me at Christmas...

When God put His Son into the manger, He gave me everything, I needed for salvation.
He gave me His Son from heaven to wash away my sins with His precious blood.
I needed peace with God, He gave me the Prince of Peace, who brought back a
blessed relationship with the Father.

I needed power against sin, He gave me the Mighty Lord, who defeated Satan in the 
wilderness and even more so on the cross. How can the devil keep sin's handcuffs on
me when Christ is the key that unlocks them?

We often need comfort in life's sorrows, He gave us the living Savior, who wipes away
our tears. We need assurance at the time of death, He gave us the risen Savior who has
already conquered death, not just for Himself but for us...

I had nothing, but with the gift of the Savior, God gave me everything I needed. 
Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift...

Prayer Suggestion:
Thank you, Lord, for giving me just what I needed
in the Savior, Help me praise Your love forever...Amen.

Ps. remember your greatest Christmas cheer comes 
when you dispense cheer...
