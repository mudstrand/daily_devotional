12/10/09~~~food for thought~~~THE JUDGE IS COMING...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
So I will come near to you for judgment...
I the Lord do not change...(Mal. 3:5, 6)

Our Lesson for Today:
Unbeliever's will do more than shrink back when Jesus comes on the Last Day.
They may have thought they could hide their sins from the One seemingly far
away in the heavens. They may have thought His eyes couldn't see their hearts...

But He is near...He does see...And He will punish...That threat is real...
The Lord who does not change makes it...He will carry it out...

The Judge is coming...No doubt about this fact, for the Lord does not change His mind.
Nor will He change the forgiveness with which He covers me or anyone else who has
asked Him into their heart. The one who judges me is the One who has already saved me...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, remind me of my salvation when I think
of You as my judge...Amen.

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
