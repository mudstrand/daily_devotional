I am forwarding this because I totally agree


We are speeding towards a one world government and the second coming at a rapid pace. I remember reading about the children of Israel who turned from God time and time again, only to realize their mistake and pray for forgiveness. Each time, God would forgive them and they would walk with him for a time.. 

So, I am going to ask you to join me in praying for our nation every day. God is in control!!! 

Our president did not encourage participation in the National Day of Prayer. He called it an event. He thinks it should be private prayer instead of Public prayer. 

May God Have Mercy On America & Protect Our Troops. 

In Texarkana last week, there were signs in people's yards that said, "America, prayer our only hope" with 2 Chron. 7:14 underneath. We certainly need God's help! 

I have no idea who started this, but I certainly agree with this e-mail. I have decided to reach out to my friends and relatives and ask you to do something that has been troubling me for a long time. 

Our nation is/has been on the slippery slope for a long time. If you look around you will find corruption, greed, moral decay, and a steady move away from the things that made us great. The principles upon which this nation was founded are no longer our backbone. However, we can reverse this trend. 

2 Chron. 7:14 in God's word he states, "If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land." 

I am convinced that we must pray for our nation and its leaders and ask for forgiveness. So I ask you to join me in this plea to our Lord. 

Would you please send this to people in your address book (send it to all of them); ask them to pray EVERYDAY... (25 to only the 5th power is 9,765,625 people.) 
IMAGINE if each person reaches TEN others...or all TWENTY-FIVE! 

If you do and they comply, we will lift up millions and millions of prayers a day to our Creator. He will hear us and in faith will answer. 

Let me just add a quote from Ronald Reagan. "If we ever forget that we are one nation under God, then we will be a nation gone under." 

I truly believe this is why the United States of America is in the shape we are in today. 

Most people have forgotten that we are one nation under God! Let us as Christians stand up and remind people of this!!
