12/04/09~~~food for thought~~~ADVENT'S ROAD CONSTRUCTION...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Make straight in the wilderness a highway for our God. Every valley shall 
be raised up, every mountain and hill be made low...(Isa. 40:3, 4)

Our Lesson for Today:
"Every valley shall be raised up," Isaiah said. When we feel that we have 
more sin than God has forgiveness, we need Isaiah's words. We need to hear
that God's love, like some earth-moving machine, has scooped up Christ's 
forgiveness and dumped it into our heart's swampy spots...

We need to pray ~ away with the doubt that grows in my swamp. Let my heart 
be filled with the solid news of Jesus' forgiveness...

"Make straight in the wilderness a highway for our God." 
Let the world plot its bypasses and curves.
The heart in which the Christ Child lives seeks to follow the straight middle line
on life's road. The believer wants to walk according to God's Word...

"Repent and be saved," read the notice. Underneath, someone had wrote, 
"If you've already repented, please disregard this notice." That is not so with
Advent's road construction. It's necessary year around...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, knock my heart flat with Your Law, and then
build it up with the "Good News of Jesus Christ." Amen.
