12/07/09~~~food for thought~~~THE LORD IS COMING

Our Bible Verse for Today:
See, I will send My messenger, who will prepare the way before Me.
Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to His temple. (Mal. 3:1a)

Our Lesson for Today:
"Jesus is coming," Malachi told the Jews of his day. BUT it would still be 400 years
before John the Baptist at the Jordan River would prepare people for the Savior's 
coming...But Malachi wrote as if it were today. "Before you know it, the promised 
Savior will be standing in the midst of His people."

Did you notice what Malachi called Him? "The Lord," he said...The eternal God would 
come down to the earth He had created to work among the creatures He had made and 
who in sin had turned away from Him...

That my friends is the miracle in the manger. That's the real reason for joy. To often
many just see a poor baby wrapped in rags and miss the real meaning of Christmas.
They see only a man and actually see nothing...

If Jesus were only a human being, we would have no cause to celebrate. Then we 
could just as well forget about Christmas or change the name of the season to the 
"holiday whatever."

Who's coming this season? The Lord Himself, stooping low in love to save sinners
like me...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, this season help me sing, "Joy to the world,
the Lord has come to me." Amen.
