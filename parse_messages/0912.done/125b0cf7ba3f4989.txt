12/21/09~~~food for thought~~~GOD IN CHRIST BECAME THE SON OF MAN 
THAT WE MIGHT BECOME THE SONS OF GOD.

Our Bible Verses for Today:
When the time had fully come, God sent His son, born of a woman,
born under the law, that we might receive the full rights of sons. (Gal 4:4, 5)

Our Lesson for Today:
Jesus was "born of a woman," ~ He was human ~ He was born a Jew ~
He was subject to God's law ~ He fulfilled it perfectly. Thus Jesus was 
a perfect sacrifice because, although He was fully human, He never 
sinned. His death brought freedom for us who were enslaved to sin so 
that we could be adopted into God's family...

If Christ had not come, there would not be a Christian in the world.
Imagine that!!!

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I thank You, for sending Jesus to set me free.
Thank You for Your love...Amen.
