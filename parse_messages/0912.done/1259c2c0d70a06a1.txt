12/17/09~~~food for thought~~~THE HEAVENLY GUEST IS AT THE DOOR
HOW SHALL I SERVE HIM?

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Have you ever noticed that there are very few purple Christmas bulbs?
There are all kinds of red, yellow, and blue ones. Someone once explained
that purple glass cuts off light waves and as a result dims the brightness.
And, of course, we want the lights of Christmas to shine...

Isn't that what Zechariah tells us in our verse? He reminds us that the Savior 
comes to "enable us to serve Him without fear in holiness and righteousness 
before Him all our days." Have you ever given any thought to the fact that 
Christians are to be Christmas bulbs shinning brightly long after Christmas
passes???

As a believer in Christ, I'm to shine, not because I'm forced to but because 
I have to. It's the very nature of those who are plugged in to the Light of the
world, to shine with His light. And there is no switch that turns me off so that I
shine only once in a while. "ALL OUR DAYS," Zechariah said...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Guest, thank you for the light of salvation.
Help me shine it to others...Amen.

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
