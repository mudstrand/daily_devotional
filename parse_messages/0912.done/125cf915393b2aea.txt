12/27/09~~~food for thought~~~BEYOND WONDERFUL

Our Bible Verse for Today:
and He will be called Wonderful Counselor...(Isa. 9:6)

Our Lesson for Today:
In Isaiah's day a counselor was one who stood at your side to offer good advice in all matters.
Isn't that a good name for the babe of Bethlehem? Wouldn't we even say that the Christ of
Christmas is a Counselor more wonderful than any other???

He needs no teachers but is Truth Himself.
He needs no counselors but is the Counselor above every counselor.
His advice is never lacking and is always correct.

To wayward ones He says, "Your sins are forgiven."
To weary ones He says, "Cast all your cares on Me because I care for you."
To worried ones He says, "Will not My heavenly Father much more care for you?"
To weeping ones He says, "Let not your heart be troubled, believe in Me."

This Jesus has experienced my wrestling against sin and Satan ~ my pains and my death.
Even something I shall never know, the agonies of hell.
That's why the name Wonderful Counselor fits Him so well. He not only advises; He does.
He did His work on the cross and now stands ready to help in every step of life as,
my Wonderful Counselor...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord and Savior, be with me as my Wonderful Counselor,
to guide me in life and in death...Amen.

[thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift!] (II Cor. 9:15)

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 

No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
