12/29/09~~~food for thought~~~THE CARE OF A LOVING FATHER...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
And He will be called.....Everlasting Father. (Isa. 9:6c)

Our Lesson for Today:
Everlasting Father, is another name Isaiah gives the Christ Child.
What tenderness, love, and comfort are in His name...

To His followers the babe of Bethlehem is like a father because of what He does.
He doesn't leave His people to fend for themselves. Instead, He does perfectly for 
them what an earthly father can only try to do for his children...

An earthly father tries to provide what he thinks is best for his children. The Savior
always provides what He knows is best...

He's my Everlasting Father. Always He walks with me ~ Always His love forgives me ~
Always His power protects me ~ He'll be there to lead me even through the valley of 
the shadow to His heaven. My earthly father meant much to me. 
Jesus, my Everlasting Father, means so much more...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord and Savior, take my hand and lead me as my 
Everlasting Father to Your heavenly home...Amen. 
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
