Merry Christmas

Yes, Its that time of the year again.
It's hard to believe another year is almost gone.
But let us be thankful for what we have to look forward to.

I am so thankful for the promises of God's word.
I'm especially thankful for John 3:16
For God so loved the world that He gave His
only Son that whosoever believeth in Him
shall not perish but have eternal life...

Yes Jesus, our Savior came, He lived, He died, and He rose again. 
Yes He did, and He has also promised to return again. 'What a day that will be.'
We often say when receiving presents from a friend, "Gee what 
a wonderful gift." But no gift can be as wonderful as what our Lord 
has done for us. Let us give thanks to Him for His promise to take us
to be with Him, to that place He has prepared for us...

We pray that each of you will have a Merry Christmas
and a Blessed New Year in Christ...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
