Thanks for the warning C. L.





The newest virus circulating is the UPS/Fed Ex Delivery Failure. You will receive an email from UPS/Fed Ex Service along with a packet number.. It will say that they were unable to deliver a package sent to you on such-and-such a date. It then asks you to print out the invoice copy attached. DON'T
TRY TO PRINT THIS. IT LAUNCHES THE VIRUS! Pass this warning on to all your PC operators at work and home. This virus has caused Millions of dollars in damage in the past few days.
Snopes confirms that it is real.

And here's what I found in TruthorFiction.com:






Email From UPS or Fedex says You've Got a Shipment That Can't Be Delivered-Virus!

Summary of the eRumor:
The email appears to come from United Parcel Service (UPS) or from Fedex. It says that a shipment could not be delivered and directs you to an attachment that allegedly contains the waybill so that you can arrange to receive or to pick up the shipment.

The Truth:
According to UPS, this email, which began circulating in July, 2008, contains a virus. It was not sent by UPS.

UPS advises not opening the attachment.

The company said it may send email notifications on occasion, but that they rarely include attachments.

If you receive an email from UPS and you're not sure it is authentic, you are encouraged to email customerservice@ups.com. Or call UPS to verify the existence of any undelivered shipments.
