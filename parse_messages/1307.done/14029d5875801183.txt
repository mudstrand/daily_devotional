Today's Verses: Psalms 2:1-2 (NLT)



1 Why are the nations so angry? Why do they waste their time with futile
plans?

2 The kings of the earth prepare for battle; the rulers plot together
against the Lord and against his anointed one. 



Today's Thoughts:

As you read the Psalms you will notice many verses give a prophetic
description of Jesus-

the Messiah (Christ) these verses are called messianic-His
life-death-resurrection and future reign.



We think of David as being the Author of many of the chapters of the Psalms,
but we also know that

he was a shepherd, soldier, and king. Something we may forget is that in
Acts 2:29-30 is that he was

also a prophet and of course this Psalm also describes the rebellion of the
nations and the coming the

coming of Christ to establish His reign. 



What we should learn from these Scriptures as well as others is that when a
nation or nations ignore

God's will and or His laws they will never win out in the end. . . I believe
that our nation had better

reexamine the laws they are passing-are they pleasing to God?

Today's Prayer Suggestion: 

Dear Lord, as you know our nation and many others have strayed from even You


ten simple laws-(the Ten Commandments). May we as Christians to always hold

up in prayer our country's leaders. May they receive Godly wisdom from You.
. . Amen.
