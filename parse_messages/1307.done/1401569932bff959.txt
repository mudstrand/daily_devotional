Today's Verses: James 4:7-8 (NLT)

So humble yourselves before God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from
you.

8 Come close to God, and God will come close to you. Wash your hands, you
sinners; 

purify your hearts, for your loyalty is divided between God and the world 



Today's Thoughts:

How can we draw near to God?-James gives five ways:

(1) "Humble yourself before God"-(4:7) Yield to His authority and will-

commit your life to Him and His control-And be willing to follow Him.

(2) "Resist the Devil"-(4:7) Don't allow Satan to entice and tempt you.

(3) "Wash your hands. . . and Purify your hearts"-that is lead a pure
life-(4:8)

Be cleansed from sin, replace your desire to sin with your desire to
experience God's purity.

(4) "Let there be sorrow and deep grief for your sins"-(4:9) Don't be
afraid to express your deep 

heartfelt sorrow for what you have done. . .

(5) "Bow down before the Lord and He will lift you up"-(4:10; I Pet. 5:6)
Bowing before the Lord

means recognizing that your worth comes from God alone. Even though we do
not deserve God's

favor, He wants to lift us up and give us worth and dignity, despite our
human shortcomings. . .



Today's Suggested Prayer:

Dear Heavenly Father, give me the will to humbly draw close to You,

replace my desire to sin that I might experience Your purity. . .Amen
