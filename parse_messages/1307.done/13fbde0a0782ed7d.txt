Today's Verse: Ex. 3:12

"Certainly I am with thee."



Today's Thoughts:

Here as well as elsewhere in the spiritual life, everything depends upon
faith, accepting Christ's

Word as a divine reality and trusting the Holy Spirit to make it true to us
from moment to moment.



When Christ says "always" in the (Gr. It means: "All the days."). He means
to give us the assurance

that there is not to be a day in our life in which that blessed presence is
not to be with us, and that

"All the days" implies "All the day." There need not be a moment in which
that presence cannot be

our experience. . .



It does not depend upon what we do-but upon what He undertakes to do. Our
attitude must be that 

of a quiet, restful faith, of a humble, lowly dependence in accordance with
the word, "Rest in the 

Lord and wait patiently for Him," 



The writer of Ps. 139 speaks of God's omnipresence as something beyond his
comprehension.

"Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, it is high, I cannot attain it."



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Thank You, Lord Jesus, for Your words, "Lo, I am, with you always. . . Amen.
