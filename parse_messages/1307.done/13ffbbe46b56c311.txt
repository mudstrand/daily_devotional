Today's Verse: Romans 7:14-16 (NLT)

14 So the trouble is not with the law, for it is spiritual and good. The
trouble is with me, for I am all too human, a slave to sin.

15 I don't really understand myself, for I want to do what is right, but I
don't do it. Instead, I do what I hate.

16 But if I know that what I am doing is wrong, this shows that I agree that
the law is good. 



Today's Thoughts:

This is more than the cry from one desperate person, it describes the
experience of all Christians

struggling against sin and trying to please God by keeping His laws and
rules without the Spirit's

help. We must never underestimate the power of sin and attempt to fight it
in our own strength.

Satin is a crafty tempter, and we have an amazing ability to make excuses-



Instead of trying to overcome sin with our own human willpower, we must take
hold of God's 

provision for victory over sin: the Holy Spirit who lives within us and
gives us power. AND

when we fall, He lovingly reaches out to help us up. . .



Today's Suggested Prayer: 

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the privilege of speaking to You in
prayer.

It is good to know that even though You are the Creator of all things in
heaven and 

earth You still hear my prayers. Continue to give me childlike faith that I
may never

doubt that You will always hear my prayer. Give me the patients to accept
Your

answers for You know what is best for me. . . Amen.
