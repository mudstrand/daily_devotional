Today's Verse: Phil 4:4-5 (NLT)

4 Always be full of joy in the Lord. I say it again-rejoice!

5 Let everyone see that you are considerate in all you do. Remember, the
Lord is coming soon. 



Today's Thoughts:

It seems strange that a man in prison would be telling a church to rejoice.
But Paul's attitude

teaches us an important lesson-our inner attitudes do not have to reflect
our outward

circumstances. Paul was full of joy because he knew that no matter what
happened to him

Jesus Christ was with him. . .

It's easy to get discouraged because of unpleasant circumstances or to take
unimportant 

events too seriously. If you haven't been joyful lately, you may not be
looking at life

from the right perspective. . . 

Ultimate joy comes from Christ living inside of us. Yes He who lives within
us will

fulfill His final purpose for us. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that my attitude would always reflect the

joy that we should have because of Christ's presence within us. Give

those who pray this prayer the assurance that Jesus is coming soon

to take them to be with Him in the place that He has prepared.Amen.
