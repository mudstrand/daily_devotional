Today's Verse: Psalms 1:3 (NLT) (those who do the Lord's will)

They are like trees planted along the riverbank, bearing fruit each season. 

Their leaves never wither, and they prosper in all they do. 



Today's Thoughts:

When the Scripture says, "In all they do, they prosper." It does not mean 

Immunity to failure or difficulties. Nor is it a guarantee of health,
wealth,

Or happiness. . .



What the Bible means by prosperity is this: when we apply God's wisdom, 

the fruit we bear will be good, and will meet with God's approval. Just as 

a tree soaks up water and bears luscious fruit, we are also to soak up God's


Word, producing actions and attitudes that honor God. . . .



To achieve anything worthwhile, we must have God's word, in our hearts. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that my spiritual roots would grow deep

into Your Word and produce fruit that is pleasing to You. . . Amen.

I Cor. 3:20 The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are
worthless.
