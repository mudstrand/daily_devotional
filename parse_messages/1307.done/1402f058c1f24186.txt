Today's Verses: Psalms 2:1-4 (NLT)

Why are the nations so angry? Why do they waste their time with futile
plans?

2 The kings of the earth prepare for battle; the rulers plot together
against the Lord and against his anointed one.

3 "Let us break their chains," they cry, "and free ourselves from slavery to
God." 
4 But the one who rules in heaven laughs. The Lord scoffs at them. 



Today's Thoughts

Yes God laughs, not at the nations, but at their confused thoughts about
power.

I guess you could say it is like the laughter of a father when his three or
four year-old

boasts that he or she can out run him or beat him in a wrestling match. The
father

knows the boundaries of power of his little child-



And so God knows the boundaries of power of the nations-every nation is
limited-

But God is superior-supreme-His power has no limits. . .



If you have to choose between confidence in God and confidence in any
nation-

choose God. Remember that the power of the tyrants of this world are limited
by 

what God allows them. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father protect our nation from a sense of false power.

Our country has lapsed into a false sense of power because of past

victories, but as we should realize all power comes from You and so

Lord we are at Your Mercy-So we pray be merciful to us and may 

Your Spirit once again be permitted to direct our nation in the way 

You so will. . . Amen.
