Subject: MEXICO IS ANGRY



Mexico is angry.

Wow! And make certain you read, at the bottom of this page, the part that
says it will take 30 more seconds to read! This is what needs to be done, in
my opinion! Please forward to all you know and ask them to forward to all
they know. Maybe, together, we can make this happen!


The shoe is on the other foot and the Mexicans from the State of Sonora,
Mexico do not like it. Can you believe the nerve of these people? It's
almost funny. The State of Sonora is angry at the influx of Mexicans into
Mexico!

Nine state legislators from the Mexican State of Sonora traveled to Tucson
to complain about Arizona 's new employer crackdown on illegals from Mexico.
It seems that many Mexican illegals are returning to their hometowns and the
officials in the Sonora state government are ticked off. 

Â 

A delegation of nine state legislators from Sonora was in Tucson on Tuesday
to state that Arizona 's new 'Employer Sanctions Law' will have a
devastating effect on the Mexican state. At a news conference, the
legislators said that Sonora, - Arizona's southern neighbor - made up of
mostly small towns - can not handle the demand for housing, jobs and schools
that it will face as Mexican workers return to their hometowns from the USA
without jobs or money.

The Arizona law, which took effect Jan. 1, punishes Arizona employers who
knowingly hire individuals without valid legal documents to work in the
United States. Penalties include suspension of, or loss of, their business
license. The Mexican legislators are angry because their own citizens are
returning to their hometowns, placing a burden on THEIR state government.


'How can Arizona pass a law like this?' asked Mexican Rep Leticia
Amparano-Gamez, who represents Nogales . 'There is not one person living in
Sonora who does not have a friend or relative working in Arizona,' she said,
speaking in Spanish. 'Mexico is not prepared for this, for the tremendous
problems it will face as more and more Mexicans working in Arizona and who
were sending money to their families return to their hometowns in Sonora
without jobs,' she said 'We are one family, socially and economically,' she
said of the people of Sonora and Arizona .

Wrong! The United States is a sovereign nation, not a subsidiary of Mexico,
and its taxpayers are not responsible for the welfare of Mexico's citizens.
It's time for the Mexican government, and its citizens, to stop feeding
parasitically off the United States and to start taking care of its/their
own needs.

Too bad that other states within the USA don't pass a law just like that
passed by Arizona. Maybe that's the answer, since our own Congress will do
nothing!

***New Immigration Laws***

Be sure to read to the bottom or you will miss the message...

1. There will be no special bilingual programs in the schools.
2. All ballots will be in this nation's language.
3. All government business will be conducted in our language.
4. Non-residents will NOT have the right to vote no matter how long they are
here.
5. Non-citizens will NEVER be able to hold political office.
6. Foreigners will not be a burden to the taxpayers. No welfare, no food
stamps, no health care or other government assistance programs. Any burden
will be deported.
7. Foreigners can invest in this country, but it must be an amount at least
equal to 40,000 times the daily minimum wage.
8. If foreigners come here and buy land... Options will be restricted.
Certain parcels including waterfront property are reserved for citizens
naturally born into this country.
9. Foreigners may have NO protests; NO demonstrations, NO waving of a
foreign flag, no political organizing, NO bad-mouthing our president or his
policies. These actions will lead to deportation.
10. If you do come to this country illegally, you will be actively hunted
and, when caught, sent to jail until your deportation can be arranged. All
assets will be taken from you.

Too strict? The above laws are the current immigration laws of MEXICO!

This will take less than thirty seconds to read. If you agree, please pass
it on. An idea whose time has come: Somehow, that doesn't seem logical.



We do not have an elite that is above the law. The self-serving must stop.
This is a good way to do that. It is an idea whose time has come. Have each
person contact a minimum of twenty people on their address list, in turn ask
each of those to do likewise.

In three days, most people in The United States of America will have read
the message. This is one proposal that really should be passed around.

***Proposed 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution***

"Congress shall make no law that applies to the citizens of the United
States that does not apply equally to all members of Congress, Senators
and/or Representatives; and, Congress shall make no law that applies to all
members of Congress, Senators and/or Representatives that does not apply
equally to the citizens of the United States.
