Today's Verse: Romans 6:11 (NLT)

You also should consider yourselves to be dead to the power of sin and 

alive to God through Christ Jesus. 



Today's Thoughts:

"Consider yourself dead to sin" means that we should regard our sinful
nature

as dead and unresponsive to sin. Because of our union and identification
with 

Christ we no longer want to pursue our old plans-desires-and goals.

Now we want to live for the glory of God. . .



As we start our "new" life in Christ, the Holy Spirit will help us to become
all 

that Christ wants us to be. . .



Today's Suggested Prayer:

Dear Lord, help me to become all that You want me to be. . . Amen.
