Today's Verse: Prov. 1:32b-33

"Fools are destroyed by their own complacency.

But all who listen to me will live in peace, untroubled by fear of harm."



Today's Thoughts:

Many proverbs point out that the "bitter fruit of living their own way"

will be the consequences people will experience in this life. We are faced 

with two choices-either choosing God's wisdom or persisting in rebellious 

independence, deciding to go it alone.



Choosing the latter will create problems for people that will destroy them.

Don't ignore God's advice-even if-it is painful for the present. It will

keep you from greater pain in the future. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, help me overcome the temptations I will meet today.

Strengthen my faith that I might have victory over the devil that

in so doing it would be to Your glory. Keep me mindful of the

sufficiency of Your grace, and let Your strength be made perfect

In my weakness. . . Amen.
