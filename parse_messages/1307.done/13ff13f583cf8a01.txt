Today's Verse: I Thess. 1:5 (NLT)

when we brought you the Good News, it was not only with words but also with
power,

for the Holy Spirit gave you full assurance that what we said was true. 

And you know of our concern for you from the way we lived when we were with
you 



Today's Thoughts:

When we tell other people about the Good News we have to depend upon the

Holy Spirit to open their eyes and convince them that they need salvation
God's power-

It is not our cleverness or persuasion-that changes people-



Without the work of the Holy Spirit, our words are meaningless. The Holy
Spirit

not only convicts people of sin but also assures them of the truth of the
Good News.



The Thessalonians could see what Paul, Silas, and Timothy were preaching was
true

because these men lived it. Does your life confirm or contradict what you
say you believe. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that my witness for you would not cause people

to doubt Your Word because of any of my speech or actions. Help me to be

sensitive to Your Holy Spirit's guidance. . . Amen
