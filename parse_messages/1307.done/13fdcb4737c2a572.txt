Today's Verse: John 14:26b

The Holy Spirit-he will teach you everything and will 

remind you of everything I have told you.



Today's Thoughts:

As we see here Jesus promised His disciple that He would send the Holy
Spirit

and He would help them remember what He had been teaching them. Actually

this ensures the validity of the New Testament. The Disciples were
eye-witnesses 

of Jesus' life and teachings, and the Holy Spirit helped them remember
without 

taking away their individual perspectives. . .



We can be confident that the Gospels are accurate records of what Jesus
taught

and did see. The Holy Spirit can teach us in the same way-As we study the
Bible, 

we can trust Him to plant truth into our mind-convince us of God's will-and 

remind us when we stray from it. . .



Prayer Suggestion for Today:

Dear Lord, I thank You for the promise of the Holy Spirit

to guide and direct my life-I pray that You would help

me to be sensitive and obedient to this promise. . .Amen
