Today's Verse: Psalms 33:11 

But the Lord's plans stand firm forever; his intentions can never be shaken.




Today's Thoughts:

"The Lord's plans stand firm forever." Are you frustrated by the
inconsistencies

you see in others or even yourself? God is completely trustworthy-His
intensions 

never change. There is a promise that whatever is good and perfect comes to
us from

the Creator who never changes (James 1:17).



When you wonder if there is anyone you can trust, remember that God is
completely

consistent. Let Him counsel you. . . 



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord I need Your presence every passing hour;

Only by Your grace can the Tempter's power be foiled.

No one but You can guide me down the path of 

righteousness, Through every trial be my guide. . .Amen.
