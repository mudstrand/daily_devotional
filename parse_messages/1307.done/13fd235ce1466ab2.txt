Today's Verse: 

"Sanctified by God the Father." Jude 1:1
<http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jude+1%3A1> 

"Sanctified in Christ Jesus." 1Corinthians 1:2
<http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Co+1%3A2> 

"Through sanctification of the Spirit." 1Peter 1:2
<http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Pe+1%3A2> 

Mark the union of the Three Divine Persons in all their gracious acts. 

How unwisely do those believers talk who make preferences in the Persons of
the Trinity; 

who think of Jesus as if He were the embodiment of everything lovely and
gracious, 

while the Father they regard as severely just, but destitute of kindness. 



Equally wrong are those who magnify the decree of the Father, and the
atonement of the Son, so as to depreciate the work of the Spirit. 

In deeds of grace none of the Persons of the Trinity act apart from the
rest. They are as united in their deeds as in their essence. 

In their love towards the chosen they are one, and in the actions which flow
from that great central source they are still undivided. 

Specially notice this in the matter of sanctification. While we may without
mistake speak of sanctification as the work of the Spirit, 

yet we must take heed that we do not view it as if the Father and the Son
had no part in it. It is correct to speak of sanctification as-

the work of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit. Still doth Jehovah
say, "Let us make man in our own image after our likeness," and thus we are 

"his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God has
before ordained that we should walk in them." 



See the value which God sets upon real holiness, since the Three Persons in
the Trinity are represented as co-working to produce a Church without 

"spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing." And you, believer, as the follower of
Christ, must also set a high value on holiness-upon purity of life and 

godliness of conversation. Value the blood of Christ as the foundation of
your hope, but never speak disparagingly of the work of the Spirit which

is your meekness for the inheritance of the saints in light. This day let us
so live as to manifest the work of the Triune God in us.



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit grant your sanctifying presence.

For Jesus sake forgive all my sins and shortcomings, especially if I have

offended some soul weak in faith or if I have neglected the opportunity

to share the Good News with someone. Grant me Your Spirits power 

so that each day I may grow in faith and in the knowledge of my Savior. . .
Amen.
