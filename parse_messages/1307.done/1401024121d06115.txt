Today's Verse: Phil 4:13 (NLT)

13 For I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength 



Today's Thoughts:

Can we really do everything?

The power we receive in union with Christ is sufficient to do His will

And to face the challenges that arise from our commitment to doing it.



He does not grant us supper human ability to accomplish anything we

can imagine without regards for His interests. As we contend for the faith,

we will face troubles-pressures-and trials-as they come as Christ to

strengthen you. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, grant me the strength to face the challenges of

Today-Grant me the grace that some soul may learn the way of life

From me, that together may rejoice with You in all eternity. Help me

To witness among my relatives and friends. . . Amen.



I Cor. 3:20 The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are
worthless.
