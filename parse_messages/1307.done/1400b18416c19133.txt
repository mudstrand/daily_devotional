Today's Verse: Phil. 4:9a

Keep putting into practice what you have learned. . .



Today's Thoughts:

It is not enough to hear or read the Word of God or even to know it well-we
must also put it into practice.

How easy it is to listen to a sermon and forget what the preacher said-How
easy it is to read the Bible and

not think about how we are to live differently-How easy it is to debate what
a passage means and not

live out that meaning. . .



Remember Exposure to God's Word is not enough-it MUST lead to obedience. . .



Today' Suggested Prayer:

Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that I would become more sensitive to Your

Holy Spirit so that I would come to a greater obedience to Your Word,

and live accordingly. . .Amen.



Phil. 4:8 Fix your thoughts on what is true and honorable and right.
