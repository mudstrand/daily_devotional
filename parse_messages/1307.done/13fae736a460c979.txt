Today's Verse: Psalms 34:6-8 

In my desperation I prayed, and the Lord listened; he saved me from all my
troubles.

For the angel of the Lord is a guard; he surrounds and defends all who fear
him. 
Taste and see that the Lord is good. Oh, the joys of those who take refuge
in him!



Today's Thoughts: 

"Taste and see," does not mean, "check out God's credentials." Instead, it
is an

invitation; "Try this; I know you will like it."



When we take that first step of obedience in following God, we cannot help
discovering

That He is good and kind-When we begin the Christian life, our knowledge of
God is

partial and incomplete-but as we trust in Him each day, we will experience
how good

He is-He will supply our needs. . .



Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord as I begin another day with You, search my heart-and-purify my

affections so that I may love only those things that are pleasing to
You-and-

that I will put You first in all things. . .Amen.
