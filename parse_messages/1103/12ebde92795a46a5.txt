03/16/2011~~~food for thought~~~THERE IS SALVATION ONLY IN OUR LORD. . .

The Verses for Today:
"then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ 
of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man 
stands before you healed. Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name 
under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved."" - Acts 4:10,12 

The Lesson for Today:
Christianity is the one true faith because Jesus, ~ the only source of
salvation, rescues us from the evil one. He delivers all people from a 
verdict of damnation and heals ills of body and soul. . .

"Christ's name is received only by faith. ~ Therefore, we are saved by
confidence in Christ's name, and not by confidence in our works.
For 'the name' here means the cause that is mentioned, because of
which salvation is gained. . .

To call upon Christ's name is to trust in His name as the cause, or price,
because of which we are saved. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, give us courage to stand firm in the 
name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. . .Amen. 
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
