03/05/2011~~~food for thought~~~YOU CAN NOT HIDE FROM GOD. . .

Our Verse for Today:
"Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; 
do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever 
you go."" - Joshua 1:9 
Our Lesson for Today: (1:1-9)
The Lord encourages Joshua with assurances of success and promises
of His presence through His empowering Word, as Joshua begins the critical 
work of conquering and allotting the Promised Land to Israel. . .

If we were left alone in our sin and weakness, we would not be able to serve
God and become successful in His eyes. Yet, God enables us through the 
promises of His Scriptures. ~ He makes us strong and courageous for service
by assuring us that through Immanuel ("God with us") we are forgiven and will
inherit not a piece of land, such as Israel, but a better, eternal home. . .

Suggested Prayer:
Dear Lord, fill us, with the promises of Your Word, that we might
be blessed by Your presence, and that we would serve You with 
strength and courage that we might find success through You. . .Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
