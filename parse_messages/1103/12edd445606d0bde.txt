03/22/2011~~~food for thought~~~A LIFE WITHOUT WORRIES

The Verses for Today:
""But blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him. 
They will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. 
It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in 
a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit."" - Jeremiah 17:7-8 
The Lesson for Today:

It goes without saying that there are people who trust in other people, are unfruitful,
In contrast, those who trust in the Lord flourish like trees plant along a riverbank. Those 
who trust in the Lord will have abundant strength, not only for their own needs, but even
for the needs of others. . .

Are you satisfied with being unfruitful, or do you, like a well watered tree, have strength 
in times of crises and even some to share as you bear fruit for the Lord. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, strengthen us to do your will, and bring all parts of our 
lives into harmony with our faith in Jesus Christ. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
