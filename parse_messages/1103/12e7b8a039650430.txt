03/03/2011~~~food for thought~~~ATTITUDE ~ ATTITUDE ~ MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE

Our Verses for Today:
"But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, 
I will come forth as gold. My feet have closely followed his steps; 
I have kept to his way without turning aside." - Job 23:10-11 

The lesson to be learned
I believe there is one thing and one thing only that can make a difference
in how we face our every day trials, even little ones, it is our attitude.

We can have the attitude of the Pharaoh of Egypt, who when confronted
by Moses and the ten plagues from God, who grumbled, and griped, and
became stubborn, causing more woes to come upon him. ~ OR ~

that of Job, who at the loss of all his possessions, even his own health,
succumbed to the will of God and remained faithful. That kind of commitment 
to Christ will give us eternal life, happiness and joy. . .

Remember ~ (Phil. 4:13) "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
And (Ro. 8:28) "And we know that all things work together for good to them that 
love God."

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, in every circumstance, grant me sincere repentance,
help me to remain patient in all Your ways, so that I may lift my
face to behold You and give You praise. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
