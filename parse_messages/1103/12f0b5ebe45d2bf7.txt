Today's Verses:
"He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain. 
Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised, and we held him in low 
esteem. Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him 
punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted." - Isaiah 53:3-4 

Today's Lesson:
This man of sorrows was despised and rejected by those around Him, and He is
still despised and rejected by many today. Some reject Christ by standing against 
Him. Others despise Christ and the great gift of salvation. . .Do you despise Him, reject, 
or accept Him?

When we think of all the years it would be before this was going to happen, we must
think of it as God pulling aside the curtain of time to let the people of Isaiah's day look
ahead to the suffering of the future Messiah and the resulting forgiveness made
available to all people. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
O Lord, what a wondrous love is this that caused our Lord Jesus 
of bliss to bear the dreadful curse of my soul. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
