Our Verses for Today:
"Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. 
See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting." - Psalm 139:23-24 

Our Lesson for Today:
"Searched me and known me! ~ What this is saying is that God is omniscient;
He knows everything about us. ~ This includes knowing our every action, our
every thought, even our future, even our very future, with perfect intimacy. . . .

Like the Psalmist we should ask God to extend His omniscience to our inner life, 
to search out the traces of sin in our lives, so that God's presence might lead us 
to everlasting life. . .

Suggested Prayer:
Thank You Lord for knowing us so completely. Lead us to agree 
with your judgement against sin, especially with the sins in our 
own lives. Cleanse us with Christ's blood, born of the virgin Mary, 
who is present for our or salvation in His Word and sacraments. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
