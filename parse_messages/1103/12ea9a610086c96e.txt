02/12/2011~~~food for thought~~~GOD'S GRACE IS UNENDING

Our Verse for Today:
"Know therefore that the LORD your God is God; he is the faithful God, 
keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love 
him and keep his commandments." - Deuteronomy 7:9 

A Lesson to be Learned:
"Steadfast love" Unlike sinful human beings, God fulfills each promise;
He remains steadfast in His love toward those who love Him. . .

"A thousand generations." There are no time limits on God's abundant
mercy for those who love Him. God's love and grace never end. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord of all creation, we thank You for the precious 
foretelling of deliverance made known to Your ancient 
people and delivered in Christ Jesus, our Lord. Grant 
us encouragement in Your precious Word. . . Amen. 
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
