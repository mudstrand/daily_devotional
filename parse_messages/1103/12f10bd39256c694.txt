Today's Verses:
"But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; 
the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. 
We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way; 
and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all." - Isaiah 53:5-6 

Today's Lesson:
Isaiah says we are like sheep ~ no this is no April fool joke. . .
Who wants to argue the point? ~ Are we not all guilty of straying?

Yet God sent His Messiah to bring us back into the fold. We have the
hindsight to see and know the identity of the promised Messiah, who
has come and died for our sins. . .

But if we know all that Jesus did and still reject Him, ~ tell me why
people still think that their sins are no greater than that of the
ancient Israelites, who could not see what we have seen? ? ?

Have you given your life to Jesus Christ, the "Good Shepherd"
(Jn. 10:11-16), or are you still like wondering sheep?


Prayer Suggestion:
O Lord, what wondrous love, once again I pray, 
"What wondrous love this is." ~ That caused my 
Lord to bear the dreadful curse for my soul. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
