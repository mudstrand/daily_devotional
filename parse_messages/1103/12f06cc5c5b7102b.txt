03/30/2011~~~food for thought~~~THE GREAT EXCHANGE

Today's Verse:
"God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might 
become the righteousness of God." - 2 Corinthians 5:21 

Today's Lesson:
Give this some thought: When we trust Christ, we make an exchange.
He takes our sin and makes us right with God. Our sin was laid on Christ
at His crucifixion. . .His righteousness is given to us at our conversion. . .

This is what Christians mean by Christ's atonement for sin. . .
In the world, bartering works only when two people exchange
goods of relatively equal value. . .

But God offers to trade for something completely worthless.
How grateful we should be for His kindness to us. . .

Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, impress upon my heart the greatness of 
Your grace to me, by the power of Your Holy Spirit,
so that I can walk confidently by faith until I see You
gloriously face to face. . .Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
