03/15/2011~~~food for thought~~~LEARNING TO KNOW GOD BETTER THROUGH FAITH

The Verses for Today:
"For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; 
and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to 
self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, 
mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love. For if you possess these 
qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and 
unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ." - 2 Peter 1:5-8 

The Lesson for Today:
Truly ~ faith must be more than a belief in certain facts ~ It must result in action,
growth in Christian character, and the practice of moral discipline, or it will die away
(James 2:14-17). . .

A life of faith leads to learning to know God better, self control, patient insurance,
godliness, goodness, and loving others. These actions do not come automatically,
they require hard work. ~ They are not optional; all of them must be a continual part 
of the Christian life. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
O Lord, I thank you for granting us all things that pertain to
life and godliness, that by Your grace there will be richly 
provided for us an entrance into Your eternal kingdom. . .Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
