03/20/2011~~~food for thought~~~THE BEST IS YET TO COME

The Verse for Today:
"May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, 
so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit." - Romans 15:13 

Lesson for Today:
Not only does the Bible contribute to our belief in the best is yet to be,
but the things of our daily lives reveal that this is true, too. . . 

The phrase, "the best is yet to be," is a positive affirmation that gives
life direction. It provides hope: there is more to come in life. Its the
spirit of expectancy; good things are going to happen. It is seen
through the eyes that look for opportunities that will be greater 
than ever. It is received through proper planning and work.
Desire is the fuel that makes it a reality. The best is yet to be!

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, strengthen my faith that
Your will is the best for me. . .Amen.



Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
