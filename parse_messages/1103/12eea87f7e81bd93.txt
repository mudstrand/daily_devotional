03?24/2011~~~food for thought~~~A GIFT FREELY GIVEN

Today's Verse:
"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is 
eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." - Romans 6:23 

Today's Lesson:
"Wages of sin." Death is the just punishment. . .
"Free gift." Nothing we can do can earn us God's grace.
God Gives it to people who can never deserve it. . .

God does not say we earned our freedom by good deeds,
but that it is a gift from Him. He does not want us to think
we have to do some good deed to earn our freedom, it is by
grace. . .

Oh yes there are people who consider freedom to be the 
ultimate human right, but no one is truly free spiritually.
We were slaves to sin and bound to death. Knowing this 
Jesus came to serve us by giving His life on the cross and
rising for us. . .

"Freedom from sin," we can now serve God. Only when we are "Slaves"
to God will we have freedom to be the people He created us to be. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I thank You for taking my place on the cross, so that 
I can become the person I was created to be. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
