03/23/2011~~~food for thought~~~VICTORIOUS N THE POWER OF THE SPIRIT.

The Verses for Today:
"[The Armor of God] Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 
Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the 
devil's schemes." - Ephesians 6:10-11 

The Lesson for Today:
In the Christian life we battle against rulers and authorities. Check out (I Pet. 5:8)
There we are told that we have to do battle against, the power of evil forces 
of fallen angel headed by Satan, who is a vicious fighter. . . 

To withstand their attacks, we must depend on God's strength and use every 
piece of His Armor. Paul is not only giving this counsel to the church, the body
of Christ, but to all individuals within the church. The whole body needs to be 
armed. . .

As you do battle against the "mighty powers of darkness," fight in the strength 
of the church, whose power comes from the Holy Spirit. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I pray that I would always see life as You see it.
Help me to stand firm against the temptations of the evil one. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
