Our Bible Verses for Today:
"Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides you. 
My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my 
portion forever." - Psalm 73:25-26 

Lesson for Today: (Ps. 18)
1 I love you, LORD, my strength. 
2 The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; 
my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, 
my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold. 

The Lord is:
Our Strength ~ Our Rock ~ Our Fortress ~ Our Deliver
Our Refuge ~ Our Shield ~ Our Stronghold
The Horn of Our Salvation

What more do we need?

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, forgive me for the times I have been envious 
and ungrateful and strengthen me to believe Your promises 
and to seek Your Eternal Kingdom. . . Amen. 

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
