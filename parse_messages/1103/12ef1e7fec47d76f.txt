03/26/2011~~~food for thought~~~IF WE CONFESS OUR SINS HE IS FAITHFUL TO FORGIVE US

Today's Verse:
"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our 
sins and purify us from all unrighteousness." - 1 John 1:9 

Today's Lesson:
Confession is suppose to free us to enjoy fellowship with Christ.
It should ease our conscience and lighten our cares.
But some Christians do not understand how it works. 
They feel so guilty they confess the same sins over and over;
then they wonder if they might have forgotten something. . .

Other Christians believe that God forgives them when they confess,
but if they died with unconfessed sin, they would be forever lost.
These Christians do not understand that God wants to forgive us.

He allowed His beloved Son to die just so He could offer us pardon.
When we come to Christ, he forgives all the sins we have committed.
We don't need to confess the sins of our past all over again, and we 
don't need to fear that God will reject us if we don't keep our slate
perfectly clean. . .

Of course we should continue to confess sins, but not because failure 
to do so will make us lose our salvation. Our relationship with Christ is
secure. ~ Instead, we should confess so that we can enjoy maximum 
fellowship and joy with Him. . .

Remember, ~ True confession also involves a commitment not to 
continue to sin. ~ We wouldn't be genuinely confessing our sins to God 
if we planned to commit them again and just wanted temporary forgiveness.

Remember, ~ We should always pray for strength to defeat temptation
the next time we face it. . .

Question, ~ If God has forgiven us for our sins because of Christ's death,
why must we confess our sins? ? ?

Answer, ~ In admitting our sins and receiving Christ's cleansing we are,
(1) agreeing with God that our sin truly is sin and that we are willing to turn form it,
(2) ensuring that we don't conceal our sins from Him and consequently from ourselves. and
(3) recognizing our tendency to sin and relying on His power to overcome it. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, give us hearts to believe and to know ourselves
as we are. So then we may truthfully confess our sins, trusting in Your
forgiveness and mercy. . . Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
