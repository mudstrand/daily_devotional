03/27/2011~~~food for thought~~~LET SUFFERING STRENGTHEN YOUR FAITH

Today's Verse:
"For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe 
in him, but also to suffer for him," - Philippians 1:29 

Today' Lesson:
Most people would say that Paul was unique. Paul considered it a privilege
to suffer for Christ. We do not by nature consider suffering a privilege.
Yet when we suffer, if we faithfully represent Christ, our message and
example affect us and others for good (see Acts 5:41).

Suffering has these additional benefits:
(1) it takes our eyes off of earthly comforts.
(2) It weeds out superficial believers.
(3) It strengthens the faith of those who endure.
(4) It serves as an example to others who may follow us. . .

When we suffer for our faith, it doesn't mean that we have done something 
wrong. In fact, the opposite is often true ~ it verifies that we have been 
faithful. Use suffering to build your character. Don't resent it or let it tear
you down. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, give Your people grace to recognize that all
praise belongs to You alone, even during times of suffering. . . Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
