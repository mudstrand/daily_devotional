03/20/2011~~~food for thought~~~THE NEEDED POWER TO LOVE AS WE SHOULD

The verses for Today:
"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, 
goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such 
things there is no law." - Galatians 5:22-23

Today's Lesson:
"The fruit of the Spirit" is really the work of the Spirit in us. The Spirit
produces these character traits that are found in the nature of Christ.
They are the by-products of Christ's control ~ we cannot obtain them 
by trying to get them without His help. . .

If we want the fruit of the Spirit to grow in us we must join our life to
His (see Jn. 15:4-5). ~ We must know him, love Him, remember Him,
and imitate Him. As a result, we will fulfill the intended purpose of the 
law ~ to love God and our neighbors. . .

Which of these qualities do you want the Spirit to produce in you?

Prayer Suggestion:
O Holy Spirit, give us daily victories over sin in our daily
life and, above all, to power to love one another. . . Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
