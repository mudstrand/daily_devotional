10/21/2011~~~food for thought~~~NOTHING BUT THE WORD

The Verses for Today:
"Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up 
in your salvation, now that you have tasted that the Lord is good." - 1 Peter 2:2-3 

The Lesson for Today:
"Grow up in your salvation" It goes without saying that when we first come to
faith we have a minimal knowledge of Christian teachings, but every Christian 
should strive to mature their faith, which leads to the full blessings of salvation.

"The milk" is nothing but the Gospel, which is also the very seed by which we
were conceived and born,. this is also the food that nourishes us when we grow 
up; it is the armor which we put on and with which we equip ourselves. . .

Yes it is everything put together. But the admixture is the human doctrines with 
which the Word of God is adulterated. Christians find that God's Word satisfies
their deepest needs as does a mother's milk satisfies a new born baby. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, thank You for the gift of the Gospel.
May we rightly praise You for Your infinite mercy. . .Amen. 
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
