GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...People who try to whittle you down are only
trying to reduce you to their size...(see Lk. 6:22, 23a)

Our Meditation for Today:

"What is truth?" Pilate asked. With this he went out again to the 
Jews and said, "I find no basis for a charge against him." (Jn. 18:38) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Pilate was cynical; he thought that all truth was relative. To many government 
officials, truth was whatever the majority of people agreed with or whatever 
helped advance their personal power and political goal...

When there is no basis for truth, there is no basis for moral right or wrong.
Justice becomes whatever works or whatever helps those in power...

In Jesus and His Word we have a standard for truth and for our moral behavior...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your Word, for Your Word is Truth, 
sanctify me in Your truth. Continue to guide me in all truth, that I might be
a better witness for You...Amen.

Keep looking up, for all truth comes from Him...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather

Have a blessed weekend!!!
