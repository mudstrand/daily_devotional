Slow Dance

This is a poem written by a teenager with cancer.


She wants to see how many people get her poem.


It is quite the poem.




This poem was written by a terminally ill young girl in a New York
Hospital.


It! was sent by a medical doctor - Make sure to read what is in the closing
statement AFTER THE POEM.



SLOW DANCE



Have you ever watched kids On a merry-go-round?



Or listened to the rain Slapping on the ground?



Ever followed a butterfly's erratic flight?



Or gazed at the sun into the fading night?



You better slow down.



Don't dance so fast.



Time is short.



The music won't last.




Do you run through each day On the fly?



When you ask How are you?



Do you hear the reply?



When the day is done




Do you lie in your bed



With the next hundred chores



Running through your head?



You'd better slow down



Don't dance so fast.



Time is short.



The music won't last.




Ever told your child,



We'll do it tomorrow?



And in your haste,



Not see his sorrow?



Ever lost touch,



Let a good friendship die



Cause you never had time



To call and say,"Hi"



You'd better slow down.


Don't dance so fast.



Time is short.



The music won't last.



When you run so fast to get somewhere



You miss half the fun of getting there.



When you worry and hurry through your day,



It is like an unopened gift....



Thrown away.



Life is not a race.



Do take it slower



Hear the music



Before the song is over.

Dear All:


PLEASE pass this mail on to everyone you know - even to those
you don't know! It is the request of a special girl who will soon leave
this world due to cancer.


This young girl has 6 months left to live, and as her dying wish,
she wanted to send a letter telling everyone to live their life to the
fullest, since she never will.

She'll never make it to prom, graduate from high school, or get
married and have a family of her own.

By you sending this to as many people as possible, you can give
her and her family a little hope, because with every name that this
is sent to, The American Cancer Society will donate 3 cents per
name to her treatment and recovery plan. One guy sent this to 500 people!
So I know that we can at least send it to 5 or 6. It's not even your money,
just your time!


PLEASE PASS ON AS A LAST REQUEST.


Dr. Dennis Shields, Professor
Department of Developmental and Molecular Biology
1300 Morris Park Avenue
Bronx, New York 10461
