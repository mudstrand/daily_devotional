GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...Two things are hard on the heart, running up stairs,
and running down people...(see Eph. 4:29)

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus prays for His disciples, "I pray for them. I am not praying for the world,
but for those You have given me, for they are Yours. All I have is Yours, and 
all you have is mine. And glory has come to Me through them... (Jn.17:9, 10) NIV


Our Thought for Today:

Have you ever given any thought to what Jesus meant when He said, "They are My glory".

God's glory is the revelation of His character and presence...

The lives of Jesus' disciples reveal His character, and He is present to the world through them.

What does your life reveal to those around you???

Does your live reveal Jesus' character and presence???

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly father, I pray that Your likeness would be visible in my life...
Forgive me for drifting away from your presence, Help me to remain steadfast
in Your will...Bless all my e-mail friends today...Amen.

Keep looking up, and He will guide your way...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
