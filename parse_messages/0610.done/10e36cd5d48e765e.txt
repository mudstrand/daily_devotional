GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought...Humor is to life what shock absorbers
are to automobiles...(see Pro. 17:22)

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus continues to pray for His disciples, "Sanctify them by the truth, 
Your Word is truth." Jn. 17:17) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

A follower of Christ becomes pure and holy through believing the Word of God (Heb. 4:12).

He or she has already accepted forgiveness through Christ's sacrificial death (Heb. 4:12).

Yes daily application for God's Word will have a purifying effect on our minds and hearts...

Scripture points out sin, it motivates us to confess, it renews our relationship with Christ,
and it guides us back to the right path...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father I thank You for the life changing power of Your Word...
I pray that I would always be sensitive to You Holy Spirit's working in my heart...
Awaken in me a greater hunger for Your Word, I pray ithese things in Jesus name...Amen.

Keep looking up, for His protection today...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
