GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...Some people succeed because they are destined to, but most people 
succeed because they are determined to...(see Eph. 6:13, 14a)

Our Meditation for Today:

Near the cross of Jesus stood His mother, His mother's sister, Mary the wife of
Clopas, and Mary Magdalene...When Jesus saw His mother there, and the 
disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He said to His mother, "Dear woman,
here is your son," and to the disciple, "here is your mother." From that time on,
this disciple took her into his home...(Jn. 19:25-27) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Even while He was dying on the cross, Jesus was concerned about His family.
He instructed John to care for Mary, His mother...

Our families are precious gifts from God, and we should value and care for them
under all circumstances...

Neither Christian work nor key responsibilities in any job or position excuse us
from caring for our families...

As you finish your morning devotion, take some time to plan something special
that you can do for your family today...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Lord, forgive me for not considering my family as precious as I should.
Often I place job, and material things at a higher priority than my family, not
necessarily by choice but by the busyness of scheduling. Help me to always
put them on my priority list, right below You...Amen.

Keep looking up, never allow the busyness of 
the day cause you to neglect God and family...
You're in the Prayers of two who care...
