GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...Swallowing angry words is much better 
than having to eat them...(see Pro. 29:11)

Our Meditation for Today:

These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: "Not one of His bones
will be broken," and as another scripture says "They will look on the one they have 
pierced." (Jn. 19:36, 37) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

The graphic details of Jesus' death are especially important in John's 
record because he was an eye witness...

Jesus died as the lambs for the Passover meal were being slain. Not
a bone was to be broken in these sacrificial lambs, as we see by Ex. 12:46.

Jesus, the Lamb of God, was the perfect sacrifice for the sins of the whole
world...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, The thought of the suffering Your Son was 
willing to endure in my place, is much more than I can understand.
My prayer is that I would be willing to accept any persecution that
may come my way as a result of being a Christian...Amen.

Keep looking up, for the strength to remain faithful...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
