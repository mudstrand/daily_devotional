GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...The best way to get even is to forget...
(see Lk. 6:35)

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus continues to pray for His disciples, as His followers we are included...
"While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by that name
You gave Me. None has been lost except the one doomed for destruction
so that Scriptures would be fulfilled...

I am coming to You now, but I say these things while I am still in the world,
so that 'they' (His followers) may have a full measure of My joy within them.
(Jn. 17:12-13) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Jesus knew all along who would be the one to betray Him. Judas was the 
"one headed for destruction," who was lost because he betrayed Jesus
and never sought forgiveness...

Judas chose his own path and suffered the consequences, just as we will
if we chose not to seek forgiveness...

One of the most common themes of Jesus' teachings is 'joy'...

He wants us to be joyful--I think the saddest thing is to see Christians walk 
around with long faces...What kind of witness is that???

The key to immeasurable joy is living in intimate contact with Christ, 
the source of all joy...

If we have an intimate relationship with Christ, we will experience God's special 
care and protection and see the victory He brings even when defeat seems certain...

Do you want to be a better witness??? "SMILE"

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that I would always have a smiley attitude
while witnessing for You. Help me to always have a Christ-like attitude.
Help me to go forth this week praising You...Amen.

Keep looking up, and your joy will be complete...
You're in the prayers of two who care...

SMILE GOD LOVES YOU!!!
