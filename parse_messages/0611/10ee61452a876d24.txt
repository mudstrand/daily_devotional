GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)...He who thinks by the inch and talks by the yard
deserves to be kicked by the foot...(see Pro. 18:6) NIV

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus had just shared with His disciples their responsibility to go out.
And with that He breathed on them and said, "receive the Holy Spirit." (Jn. 20:22) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

This may have been a special filling of the Holy Spirit for the disciples.
a foretaste of what all believers would experience at the time of Pentecost
(Acts 2) and forever after...

To do God's work, we need the guidance and power of the Holy Spirit.
We must avoid trying to do His work in our own strength...

Our Prayer for Today:

Most Gracious Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your Holy Spirit's power.
Forgive me for running out ahead of You in seeking to share the Good News.
Help me to always remember that my works alone are no more than filthy
rags (Isa 64:6). Anoint me with Your Holy Spirit's power for I ask it in Jesus
name...Amen.

Keep looking up, all things are possible with Him...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
