Body (clean, unformatted):
===================================================================
GOOD MORNING!!!~~~~(food for thought)...The company that you keep will determine
the trouble you meet...(see Pro. 22:24, 25)

Our Meditation for Today:

Taking Jesus' body, the two of them, (Joseph of Arimathea, and Nicodemus) wrapped
it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs.

At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, 
in which no one had even laid.

Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid 
Jesus there...(Jn 19:40-42) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

These two men were secret followers of Jesus. They were afraid to make thier allegiance
known because of their positions in the Jewish community...

Joseph was a leader and honored member of the Jewish high council.
Nicodemus, also a member of the high council, had come to Jesus by night (Jn. 3:1)
and later tried to defend him before the other religious leaders (Jn. 7:50-52).

Yet they risked their reputations to provide for Jesus' burial...

Are you a secret believer?? Do you hide your faith from your friends and fellow workers??

This is an appropriate time~~~just maybe your last chance, to step out of hiding and let 
others know whom you follow...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, help me to ever be faithful in letting my light shine for you,
for we know not what tomorrow may bring...I pray that men of your choosing would
be voted into office...I pray that all believers who are voting would seek first godly
wisdom...Amen.

Keep looking up, let us remain faithful at all times...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
