GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)...Patience is the ability to keep your motor idling
when you feel like stripping your gears...(see Pro. 16:32)

Our Meditation for Today:

John writes: Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of His disciples,
which are not recorded in this book. But these are written that you may believe that 
Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His
name...(Jn. 20: 30, 31) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

To understand the life and mission of Jesus more fully, all we need to do is study the 
Gospels. John tells us that his Gospel records only a few of the many events in Jesus'
life on earth...

But the Good News includes everything we need to know to believe that Jesus is the 
Messiah, the Son of God, through whom we receive eternal life...

What have you done with the Good News???

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the Gospels in Your Book.
The most meaningful Good News to me is John 3:16 and Jn. 20:31...
Thank You Lord for this Good News...Amen.

Keep looking up, there is no friend like Jesus...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
