GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)...The worship most acceptable to God comes from
a thankful and cheerful heart...(see Ps. 100:4, 5)

Our Meditation for Today:

Peter asks Jesus how John would die. Jesus replies, "If I want Him to remain 
until I return, what is that to you? You must follow Me." (Jn. 21:22) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Peter was concerned about Johns future, But Jesus tells Peter not to concern himself
with that...

So often we tend to compare our lives to others, sometime to rationalize our own level
of devotion to Christ or to question God's justice...

Jesus response to us as he did Peter... What is that to you?? You follow me!!

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Lord, make me mindful of the fact that each day has much to 
be thankful for not just this one day which we call Thanksgiving day.
I thank Thee first of all for Your love and mercy~~then for family and 
friends~~for health and home~~for freedom of worship and speech
and for eternal life in Christ...Amen.

Keep looking up, a grateful though toward heaven is of itself a prayer...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
