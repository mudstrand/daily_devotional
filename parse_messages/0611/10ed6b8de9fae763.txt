Christian Bumper Stickers 

Don't let your worries get the 
best of you; remember, 
Moses started out as a basket case. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

Some people are kind, polite, and sweet-spirited until you try to sit in their pew. 

*+! *+*+* +*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

Many folks want to serve God,
but only as advisors. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

It is easier to preach ten sermons
than it is to live one. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

The good Lord didn't create anything 
without a purpose, 
but mosquitoes come close. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

When you get to your wit's end, 
you'll find God lives there. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

People are funny; 
they want the front of the bus, 
the middle of the road, 
and 
the back of the church. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

Opportunity may knock once,
but temptation 
bangs on your front door forever. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

Quit griping about your church;
if it was perfect,
you couldn't belong. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

If the church wants a better pastor, 
it only needs to pray 
for the one it has. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

God Himself does not propose 
to judge a man until he is dead. 
So why should you? 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

Some minds are like concrete: 
thoroughly mixed up and permanently set. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

Peace starts with a smile. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

I don't know why some people 
change churches; 
what difference does it make 
which one you stay home from?! 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

A lot of church members who are singing "Standing on the Promises" 
are just sitting on the premises. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

We were called to be witnesses,
not lawyers or judges. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

Be ye fishers of men. 
You catch them - He'll clean them. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

Coincidence is when God chooses
to remain anonymous. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

Don't put a question mark 
where God put a period. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

Don't wait for 6 strong men 
to take you to church. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

Forbidden fruits create many jams. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

God doesn't call the qualified,
He qualifies the called. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

God grades on the cross, not the curve. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

God loves everyone, but probably prefers 
"fruits of the spirit" 
over 
"religious nuts!" 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

God promises a safe landing, 
not a calm passage. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

He who angers you, 
controls you! 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

If God is your Co-pilot - swap seats! 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

Prayer: 

Don't give God instructions --
just report for duty! 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

The task ahead of us is 
never as great as the Power behind us. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

The Will of God 
never takes you to where
the Grace of God will not protect you. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

We don't change the message, 
the message changes us. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

You can tell how big a person is
by what it takes to..........
discourage him. 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

The best mathematical equation
I have ever seen: 
1 cross + 3 nails= 4 given. 
â€ â€ â€ 

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 

If this e-mail blessed you
in a profound way today 
my Dear Friend, 
PLEASE 
pass this along to everyone 
in your address book 
to bless them today, tomorrow 
and ALWAYS! 
May God and His Son 
bless you from today on out!
