GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)...A marriage may be made in heaven, but the
maintenance must be done on earth...(see Eph. 5:33)

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus returns: A week later His disciples were in the house again, 
and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus 
came and stood among them and said. "Peace be with you!"

Then He said to Thomas, "Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach
out you hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe."

Thomas said to Him, "My Lord and my God!" (Jn. 20 26-28) NIV

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus wasn't hard on Thomas for his doubts. Despite his skepticism, 
Thomas was still loyal to the believers and to Jesus Himself...

Some people need to doubt before they will believe. If doubt leads to questions,
questions lead to answers, and the answers are accepted, then doubt has done
good work.

It is when doubt becomes stubbornness and stubbornness becomes a life-style
that doubt harms faith...

When you doubt, don't stop there. Let your doubt deepen your faith as you 
continue to search for the answers...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, our creator and sustainer, I pray that any doubts 
that may come my way would always be such that it would cause me to 
search for the truth, thus causing my faith in You to grow...May I grow 
each day in faithfulness to You...Amen.

Keep looking up, trusting in His love and power...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
