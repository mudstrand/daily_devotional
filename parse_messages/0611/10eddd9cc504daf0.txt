GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)...Now there's even a "dial-a-prayer" for atheists.
You call a number and nobody answers...(see Ps. 14:1a)

Our Meditation for Today:

JESUS APPEARS TO HIS DISCIPLES:

Jesus again says, "Peace be with you! as the Father has sent Me, 
I am sending you." Jn. 20:21) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Jesus has again identified himself with His Father. He tells His disciples by
whose authority He did His work...

Then He passed the job to His disciples of spreading the Good News of
salvation around the world...

Now we need to remember: (1) Our authority comes from God, and 
(2) Jesus has demonstrated by words and actions how to accomplish
the job He has given to us...

As the Father sent Jesus, Jesus sends His followers~~~every believer

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to always remember to pick up the baton 
that You handed to every believer...As the Father sent You, and You went 
forward knowing what the end would bring You remained faithful, help me
Lord to also remain faithful...Amen.

Keep looking up, trust that He knows what is best...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
