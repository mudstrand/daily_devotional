GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)...He who is waiting for something to turn up might
start by turning up his own shirt sleeves...(see Pro. 14:23)

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus challenges Peter: When they had finished eating Jesus said to Simon Peter, 
"Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?" "Yes Lord," he said, 
"You know that I love you." Jesus said, "feed my lambs."

Again Jesus said, "Simon son of John, do you truly love Me?" He answered, "Yes,
Lord, You know that I love You." Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep...

The third time He said to him, "Simon son of John, do you Love me?" Peter was hurt
because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?" He said, Lord, You
know all things; You know that I love You."

Jesus said,"Feed my sheep." (Jn. 21:15-17) NIV 


Our Thought for Today:

Jesus led Peter through an experience that would remove the cloud of his denial.
Peter had denied Jesus three times. Three times Jesus asked Peter if he loved 
Him...When Peter answered yes, Jesus told him to feed His sheep...

It is one thing to say you love Jesus, but the real test is a willingness to serve Him...

Peter had repented, and here Jesus was asking him to commit his life. Peter's life 
changed when he finally realized who Jesus was. 

His occupation changed from fisherman to evangelist; his denial changed from 
impetuous to "rock' and his relationship to Jesus changed--he was forgiven and 
he finally understood the significance of Jesus' words about His death and resurrection.

How would you respond if Jesus asked you, "Do you love Me?" Do you really love
Jesus? Are you even His friend? 

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that if my life should ever be threatened
for knowing You, I would never deny You...Strengthen my faith and courage
that I may not ever deny You...Amen

Keep looking up, He may just have a blessing for you today...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
