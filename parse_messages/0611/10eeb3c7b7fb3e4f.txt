GOOD MORNING!!!~~~~(food for thought)...The best inheritance a father can leave his
children is a good example. (see I Thess. 2:11)

Our Meditation for Today:

After Jesus had bestowed the Holy Spirit upon His disciples He says to them:
"If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they
are not forgiven." (Jn. 20:23) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Jesus was giving the disciples their Spirit-powered and Spirit-guided mission,
to preach the Good News about Jesus so peoples sins might be forgiven...

The Disciples did not have the actual power to forgive sins (only God can forgive
sins), but Jesus gave them the privilege of telling new believers that their sins
have been forgiven because they had accepted Jesus message. (see Mt. 16:19)

All believers have this same privilege. We can announce forgiveness of sins with 
certainty when we ourselves have found repentance and faith...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for the assurance that You do forgive our sins.
And we can draw this assurance from your words in Ro. 10:9 where it says, "That 
if you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God 
raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. In faith given to me by the Holy Spirit
I do believe that Jesus is Lord and so confess...Amen.

Keep looking up, keep plugging away for Jesus...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
