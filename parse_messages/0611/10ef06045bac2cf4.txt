GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)...God intervenes in the affairs of men
by invitation only...(see Rev. 3:20)

Our Meditation for Today:

Now Thomas (called Didymus, one of the twelve, was not with the disciples 
when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord!"

But he told them, "Unless I see the nail marks in His hands and put my finger
where the nails were, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe it." (Jn 20:24, 25) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Have you ever wished you could actually see Jesus, touch Him, and hear His words?

Are there times you would like to sit down with Him and get His advice?

Thomas wanted Jesus' physical presence. But God's plan is wiser. He has not limited
Himself to one physical body; He wants to be present with you at all times...

Even now He is with you in the form of the Holy Spirit...

You can talk to Him, and you can find His words to you in the pages of the Bible.
He can be as real to you as He was to Thomas...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the avenue of prayer and that the line is 
always open. I thank You that You know our needs before we even open our
mouth. But I truly have to confess, that there are times when it would be really
nice to talk to someone with skin on...Bless and protect our service men, and 
be with their families...Give wisdom to our countries leaders...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is waiting to hear from you...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
