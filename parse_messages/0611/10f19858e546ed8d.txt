GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)...Your temper is like a fire. It gets very destructive
when it gets out of control...see Pro. 25:28)

(I will be working through the book of Hebrews now)

Our Meditation for Today:

In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times 
and in various ways...

But in these last days He has spoken to us by His Son, whom He appointed 
heir of all things, and through whom He made the universe...(Heb. 1:1, 2) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

God used many approaches to send His message to people in the OT times...

He spoke to Isa. in vissions~~(Isa. 6), the Jacob in a dream~~(Gen.28:10-22, 
and to Abrahan and Moses personaly~~(Gen 18; Ex. 31:18)

Jewish people familiar with these stories would not have found it had to believe
that God was still revealing His will, but it was astonishing for them to think, that
God had revealed Himself by speaking trough His Son, Jesus Christ...

Jesus is fulfillment and culmination of God's revelation through the centuries...

When we know Him, we have all we need to be saved from our sin and to have
a perfect relationship with God...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for what Your Son did for me.
I thank you for the message of salvation He brought to earth... I
pray that His message would go forward through out the world.
I ask this in His holy and precious name...Amen.

Keep looking up, all good things come from above...
you're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather

ps. sorry if you got a partical message

it's own...
