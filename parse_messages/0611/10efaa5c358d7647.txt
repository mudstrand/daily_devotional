GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)...The grass may look greener on the other side,
but it still needs to be mowed...(see Heb. 13:5)

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus told Peter, "Because you have seen me, you have believed;
blessed are those who have not seen yet have believed." (Jn. 20:29) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Some people think they would believe in Jesus if they could see a
definite sign or a miracle...

But Jesus says we are blessed if we can believe without seeing...

Really we have all the proof we need in the words of the Bible and
the testimony of believers...

A physical appearance would not make Jesus any more real to us 
then He is now...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, I do thank You for Your Word~~~the Bible.
For in it I find all the information I need to believe in Christ...I thank
You for the proof of Your love and mercy which we also find written 
about in Your Word...Amen.

Keep looking up, for you are still in His love...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
