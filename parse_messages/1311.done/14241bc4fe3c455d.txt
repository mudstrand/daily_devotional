Today's Verses: Psalms 22:30-31 (NLT) 

30 Our children will also serve him. Future generations will hear about the
wonders of the Lord

31 His righteous acts will be told to those not yet born. They will hear
about everything he has done.

Today's Thoughts:

We need to remember that unborn generations are depending upon our
faithfulness today.

As we teach our children about the Lord, so they will teach their children
and their children's 

children. If we fail to tell our children about the Lord, we may well be
breaking the chain of

God's influence in generations to come. We must view our children and all
young people we

meet as God's future leaders. . .



If we want our children to serve the Lord, they must hear about Him from us-

It is not enough to rely on the church or those with more knowledge to
provide

all their Christian education-We most reinforce the lessons of the Bible in
our home. . . 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, I pray again that Your Spirit would be my guide so
that I

would be faithful in sharing Your word so that generations to come would
come

to faith in You. . . Amen.
