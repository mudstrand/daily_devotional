Today's Verse: Psalms 21:7 (NLT)

7 For the king trusts in the Lord. The unfailing love of the Most High will
keep him from stumbling. 

Today's Thoughts:

Because David trusted in God-God would not let him stumble (be removed from
his throne).

When we trust in God we have permanence and stability. We may lose a great
deal such as,

families-jobs-material possessions-but we cannot be shaken from God's favor.



He will be our foundation our solid rock-He will never leave or desert us. .
.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

I thank You, O Lord, that I have a solid foundation in You.

I thank You, for Your loving favor, that was proven by

Your Son taking my place on the cross and paying the 

penalty in full for my sins. . . Amen.
