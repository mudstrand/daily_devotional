Today's Verses: Ps. 25: 12-13

12 Who is the man who fears the Lord? Him will he instruct in the way that
he should choose. 

13 His soul shall abide in well-being, and his offspring shall inherit the
land. 

Today's thoughts:

To fear the Lord is to recognize God's attributes. He is
holy-almighty-righteous-pure-

all knowing-all powerful-and all wise. When we regard God correctly, we gain
a clearer 

picture of ourselves, sinful-weak-frail-and needy.

When we recognize who God is and who we are-we will fall at His feet in
humble respect.

Only then will He show us His way. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, forgive me for not always having a clear view of who You really are.

Help me to always come before You in humble respect. . . Amen.



Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

By God's trials, He means to purify us-and to bring 

us into implicit humble trust in Himself.

(Horace Bushnell)
