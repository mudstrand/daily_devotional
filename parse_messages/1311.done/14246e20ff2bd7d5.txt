Today's Verse: Psalms 23:1 (ESV)

The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.

Today's Thoughts:

In describing the Lord as a shepherd, David wrote out of his own experience.

Sheep are totally dependent on the shepherd for provision, guidance, and
protection.

The New Testament call Jesus the "Good Shepherd" (Jn. 10:11).

The "Great Shepherd" (Heb. 13:20).

The "Head Shepherd" (I Pet. 5:4).



As the Lord is the Good Shepherd, so we are His sheep-not frighten, passive
animals, 

but obedient follows, wise enough to follow one who will lead us in the
right places and 

in right ways. This psalm does not focus on animal-like qualities of sheep
but on the 

discipleship qualities of those who will follow-When you recognize the Good
Shepherd 

follow Him. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for being a caring Shepherd and a
dependable guide.

I thank You for being my one sure hope of eternal life and security. . .
Amen.

Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckeled

Around your waist. Eph. 6:14
