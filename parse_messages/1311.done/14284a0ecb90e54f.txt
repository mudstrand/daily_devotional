Today's Verses: Ps. 25:16-18

16 Turn to me, and have pity on me. I am lonely and oppressed. 

17 Relieve my troubled heart, and bring me out of my distress. 

18 Look at my misery and suffering, and forgive all my sins. 

Today's Thoughts:

Do life's problems seem to go from bad to worse? 

God is the only one who can reverse this downward spiral. 

He can take our problems and turn them into glorious victories. 

BUT there is one necessary requirement-we like David, must cry out,

"Turn to me and have mercy on me." When you are willing to do that, 

God can turn the worst into something wonderful.



The next step is yours-God has already made His offer. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord Jesus, thank You for being my one and only-

all-sufficient Savior. . . Amen.

(the Lord's promise) I will be with you always-(Mt. 28:20)
