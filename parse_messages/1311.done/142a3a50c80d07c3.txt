Today's Verses: Ps. 27:1-3

The Lord is my light and my salvation. Who is there to fear? The Lord is my
life's fortress. Who is there to be afraid of? 
2 Evildoers closed in on me to tear me to pieces. My opponents and enemies
stumbled and fell. 

3 Even though an army sets up camp against me, my heart will not be afraid.
Even though a war 

breaks out against me, I will still have confidence {in the Lord}. 

Today's Thoughts:

Fear is a dark shadow that envelopes us and ultimately imprisons us within
ourselves.

I think that each of us have been a prisoner of fear one time or
another-fear of rejection, 

misunderstanding, uncertainty, sickness, or even death. But we can conquer
fear by using 

the bright liberating light of the Lord, who brings salvation.

If we want to dispel the darkness of fear, let us remember the words of the
psalmist, 

"the Lord is my light and my salvation."

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, the next time I come into a situation that causes fear, help me
remember the wise 

words of wisdom and encouragement of the psalmist; "The Lord is my light and
salvation. . . Amen.
