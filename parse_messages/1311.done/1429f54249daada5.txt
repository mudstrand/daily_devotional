Spec. Thanksgiving Verses: Phil 4:4-7 

4 Always be joyful in the Lord! I'll say it again: Be joyful! 

5 Let everyone know how considerate you are. The Lord is near. 

6 Never worry about anything. But in every situation let God know 

what you need in prayers and requests while giving thanks. 

7 Then God's peace, which goes beyond anything we can imagine, 

will guard your thoughts and emotions through Christ Jesus 

Thanksgiving Thought's:

Imagine never worrying about anything! It seems like an impossibility-

we all have worries on the job, in our homes, at school. BUT Paul advices 

us to turn our worries into prayers. Would you like to worry less?

Then pray more! Whenever you start to worry, stop and pray, giving thanks 

for all that God has done in the past and what He promises to do in the
future.
