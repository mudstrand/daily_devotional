Today's Verses: Psalms 22:9-11 (NLT)

You brought me safely from my mother's womb and led me to trust you at my
mother's breast.

10 I was thrust into your arms at my birth. You have been my God from the
moment I was born. 
11 Do not stay so far from me, for trouble is near, and no one else can help
me. 

Today's Thoughts:

Be assured that God's loving concern does not begin on the Day we are born
and end on the day we die.

It reaches back to the days before we were born and reaches ahead along the
unending path of eternity.

Really our only sure help comes from a God whose concern for us reaches
beyond our earthly existence.



How can anyone reject such love. . 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, where could I go while seeking a refuge for my soul?

Needing a friend to help me to the end-where could I go but to You O Lord.

Yes only in You can I find comfort for my soul. Thank You Lord, for this

blessed assurance. . . Amen.
