Today's Verses: Ps. 24: 7-10

7 Lift up your heads, O gates! And be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the
King of glory may come in. 

8 Who is this King of glory? The Lord, strong and mighty, the Lord, mighty
in battle! 

9 Lift up your heads, O gates! And lift them up, O ancient doors, that the
King of glory may come in. 

10 Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory! 

Today's Thoughts:

The question was, "Who is the King of glory?" Of course He is identified as
the Lord Almighty-

The Messiah Himself. This phrase was often used in the temple-outside the
temple the people 

would resound with the answer, "He is the Lord Almighty." This was an
important lesson to the 

children who were participating- 



It is a lesson we should all learn well-YES the King of Glory, is the Lord
of hosts. Matt 21:5 (ESV)

"Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your king is coming to you, humble,
and mounted 

on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.' " 



When Jesus entered Jerusalem on the donkey He affirmed His Messianic royalty
as well as His humility.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord of grace and mercy draw near to your people wherever they are, 

and help them through their trials and troubles. Forgive us all of our many 

sins through the cleansing power of Your precious blood. Grant us the
strength 

to live victorious every day. . . Amen.
