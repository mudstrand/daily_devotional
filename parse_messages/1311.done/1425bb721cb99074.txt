Today's Verses: Ps. 24:1-3
The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof, the world and those who
dwell therein, 
2 for He has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the rivers. 
3 Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord? And who shall stand in His holy
place? 
Today's Thoughts:
Because "the earth is the Lord's" all of us are stewards or caretakers.
We should be committed to the proper management of the world and 
its resources-BUT we are not to become devoted to anything created 
or act as the sole proprietors-because this world will pass away (I Jn.
2:17)

Verse one sure shots a hole in the old saying of some-" I'm a self-made
Man."
All that we possess is a gift from God, He is the one who has given us
strength
to get up and do our thing-He has given us the resources to put together the

things we enjoy. . .
Today's Prayer Suggestion:
O Lord, as I think about all that exists and that everything came about by
Your creation, I feel so small and yet You invite us to come before You with

our requests. My request today is that Your Holy Spirit would comfort all
who are in need of comfort. . . Amen.
