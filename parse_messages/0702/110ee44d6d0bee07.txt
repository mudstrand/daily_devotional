GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Time heals almost everything...Give time time...

Our Meditation for Today:

Unlike other high priests, He (Jesus) does not need to offer 
sacrifices day after day, first for His own sins, and then for
the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for 
all when He offered Himself...(Heb. 7:27) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Because Jesus did die once for all, He brought the sacrificial
system to an end. He forgave sins, past, present, and future...

The Jews did not need to go back to the old system because 
Christ, the perfect sacrifice, completed the work of redemption...

You don't have to look for another way to have your sins forgiven,
Christ was, and still is the final sacrifice for you...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the ultimate sacrifice,
that You made for my sins. I thank You for being my mediator,
that You stand ready to defend me before our Heavenly Father.
I pray that You would protect my e-mail friends with a hedge
of thorns from the evil one...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
