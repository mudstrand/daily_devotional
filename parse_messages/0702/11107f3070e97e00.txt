GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Whatever doesn't kill you really does make you stronger...

Our Meditation for Today:

He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves;
but He entered the Most Holy Place once for all by His own
blood, having obtained eternal redemption...(Heb. 9:12) NIV

Our Thought for Today:


Though you know Christ, you may believe that you have to work 
hard to make yourself good enough for God. But rules and rituals
have never cleansed people's hearts...

By Jesus' blood alone (1) We have our conscience cleansed,
(2) We are freed from death's sting and can live to serve God,
and (3) We are freed from sin's power...

If you are carrying a load of guilt because you are finding that
you can't be good enough for God, take another look at Jesus'
death and what it means to you...

Christ can heal your conscience and deliver you from the frustration 
of trying to earn God's favor...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for what Christ's shed blood
means in my life...I thank You for removing the guilt of my sins...
I thank You for the healing power that comes from Christ, since
Christ came into my life...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
