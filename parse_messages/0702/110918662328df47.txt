GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Make peace with the past so it won't screw up the present.

Our Meditation for Today:

And, once made perfect, He became the source of salvation
for all who obey Him...(Heb. 5:9) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Christ was always morally perfect. By obeying, He demonstrated
His perfection to us, not to God or to Himself,,,

In the Bible. perfection usually means completeness or maturity...

By sharing our experience of suffering, Christ shared our human
experience completely. He is now able to offer eternal salvation
to those who obey Him...

Look to Phil. 2:5-11 and you will see Christ's attitude as He took
on human form...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I am so thankful for what You 
were will to do for me. I thank You for the amazing love
You demonstrated in going the way of the cross in my
place...Help me to demonstrate a Christ-like love in my
daily walk...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
