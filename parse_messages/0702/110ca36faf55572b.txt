GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Be eccentric now. Don't wait for old age to wear purple.

Our Meditation for Today:

Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of 
His purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised,
He confirmed it with an oath...

God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which
it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold
of the hope offered to us may be greatly encouraged...(Heb. 6:17, 18) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

These two unchangeable things mentioned here are God's promise and 
His oath. God embodies all truth; so, He cannot lie. Because God is truth, 
you can be secure in His promise; you don't need to wonder if He will
change His plans...

Our hope is secure and immovable, anchored in God, just as a ship's
anchor holds firmly to the seabed...

To the true seeker who comes to God in belief, God gives an unconditional
promise of acceptance. When you ask God with openness, honestly, and 
sincerity to save you from your sins He will do it...

This truth should give you encouragement, assurance, and confidence...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the assurance that You
are a Just and Holy God. I thank You for this encouraging thought.
I thank You for the promise that You do forgive me of my sins.
So once again Lord, I come before You seeking forgiveness for 
all the sins I have committed...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
