GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~When it comes to chocolate, resistance is futile...

Our Meditation for Today:

Once made perfect, He became the source of eternal salvation
for all who obey Him...(Heb. 5:9) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Christ was always morally perfect. By obeying, He demonstrated
His perfection to us, not to God or Himself...

In the Bible, perfect usually means completeness or maturity...

By sharing our experience of suffering, Christ shared our human
experience completely. He is now able to offer eternal salvation to 
those who obey Him...

See Phil. 2:5-11 for Christ's attitude as He took on human form...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray today for a Christ-like
attitude in all that I do, guide and direct my every 
thought...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
