WHEN YOU THOUGHT I WASN'T LOOKING 

(Written by a former child) 

A message every adult should read, because children are watching you
and doing as you do, not as you say. 

When you thought I wasn't looking, I saw you hang my first painting on
the refrigerator, and I immediately wanted to paint another one. 

When you thought I wasn't looking, I saw you feed a stray cat, and I
learned that it was good to be kind to animals. 

When you thought I wasn't looking , I saw you make my 
favorite cake for me and I learned that the little things can be 
the special things in life. 

When you thought I wasn't looking, I heard you say a prayer, and I knew
there is a God I could always talk to and I learned to trust in God. 

When you thought I wasn't looking, I saw you make a meal and take it to
a friend who was sick, and I learned that we all have to help take care
of each other. 

When you thought I wasn't looking, I saw you give of your time and
money to help people who had nothing and I learned that those who have
something should give to those who don't. 

When you thought I wasn't looking, I saw you take care of our house and
everyone in it and I learned we have to take care of what we are given.


When you thought I wasn't looking, I saw how you handled your
responsibilities, even when you didn't feel good and I learned that I
would have to be responsible when I grow up. 

When you thought I wasn't looking, I saw tears come from your eyes and
I learned that sometimes things hurt, but it's all right to cry. 

When you thought I wasn't looking, I saw that you cared and I wanted to
be everything that I could be. 

When you thought I wasn't looking, I learned most of life's lessons
that I need to know to be a good and productive person when I grow up. 

When you thought I wasn't looking, I looked at you and wanted to say,
"Thanks for all the things I saw when you thought I wasn't looking." 

I AM SENDING THIS TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE I KNOW WHO 
DO SO MUCH FOR OTHERS AND THINK NO ONE EVER SEES. 

LITTLE EYES SEE A LOT . 

Each of us (parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, teacher or friend)
influence the life of a child.

How will you touch the life of someone today? 
Just by sending this to someone else, you will probably make them at
least think about their influence on others.
