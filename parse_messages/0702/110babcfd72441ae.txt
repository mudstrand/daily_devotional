GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~It's never too late to have a happy childhood.
But the second one is up to you and no one else.

Our Meditation for Today:

God is not unjust; He will not forget your work and the love
you have shown Him as you have helped His people and
continue to help them...(Heb. 6:10) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

It is easy to get discouraged, thinking that God has forgotten us.
But God is never unjust. He never forgets or overlooks our hard
work for Him...

Presently you may not be receiving rewards and acclaim, but 
God knows your efforts of love and ministry...

Let God's love for you and His intimate knowledge of your service
for Him bolster you as you face disappointment and rejection here
on earth...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, the creator and sustainer of all that exists.
I thank You that You are always there for me during difficult times.
I thank You for Your loving kindness, and forgiveness...Place Your
protective hand upon each and everyone of my e-mail friends...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
