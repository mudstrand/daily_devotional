GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Frame every so-called disaster with these words: 
"In five years, will this matter?"

Our Meditation for Today:

For when there is a change of the priesthood, there 
must also be a change of the law...

He of whom these things are said belong to a different
tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the
altar...

For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, and 
in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests...
(Heb. 7:12-14) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Jesus' high-priestly role was superior to that of any priest of Levi,
because the Messiah was a priest of a higher order (Ps. 110:4)...

If the Jewish priests and their laws had been able to save people,
why would God need to send Christ as a priest, who came not from
the tribe of Levi (the priestly tribe) but from the tribe of Juda?

The animal sacrifices had to be repeated, and they offered only
temporary forgiveness; but Christ's sacrifice was offered once, 
and it offers total and permanent forgiveness...

Under the new covenant, the levitical priesthood was canceled in
favor of Christ's role as High Priest...

Because Christ is our High Priest, we need to pay attention to Him.
No minister, no leader, or Christian friend can substitute for Christ's
work and for His role in our Salvation...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the Gift of eternal
life, that is mine because of Christ's shed blood on the 
cross...I thank You for the fact that His sacrifice is once,
and for all...I thank You for the cleansing power of that 
precious blood...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
