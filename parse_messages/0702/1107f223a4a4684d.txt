GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Save for retirement starting with your first paycheck...

Our Meditation for Today:

Although He was a Son, he learned obedience from
what He suffered...(Heb. 5:8) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Jesus' human life was not a script that He passively followed.
It was a life He chose freely (Jn. 10:17, 18)...

It was a continuous process of making the will of God the Father
His own. Jesus chose to obey, even though obedience led to
suffering and death...

Because Jesus obeyed perfectly, even under great trial, He can 
help us obey, no matter how difficult obedience seems to be...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, guide and direct me in thy will...
I pray that through obedience my life would be an example
of You living with-in me...Protect our troops today I pray...
Help them recognize those who wish to do them harm...
Be with those who are innocently caught in the middle of this
war...I pray for the day that peace will reign eternal...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
