GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Life is too short for long pity parties.
So get busy living, or get busy dying...

Our Meditation for Today:

If they fall away to be brought back to repentance,
because to their loss they are crucifying the Son
of God all over again and subjecting Him to public 
disgrace...(Heb. 6:6) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

This verse points to the danger of the Hebrew Christians' returning to
Judaism and so committing apostasy...

There are those who apply this verse to superficial believers who renounce
their Christianity or to unbelievers who come close to salvation and the turn
away...

Either way, those who reject Christ will not be saved. Christ died once for all.
He will not be crucified again. Apart from His cross, there is no other possible
way of salvation...

The author is warning against the hardness of heart that would make repentance 
inconceivable for the sinner...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for another new day. 
I thank You for the one sure way to inherit eternal life.
I thank You for Your grace and mercy. I pray that You
would enlighten my heart, that I may not sin against You.
I pray for good health and safety for all my e-mail friends...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
