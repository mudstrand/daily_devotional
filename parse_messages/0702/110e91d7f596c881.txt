GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~What other people think of you is none of your business...

Our Meditation for Today:

Therefore He is able to save completely those who come to God
through Him, because He always lives to intercede for them...(Heb.7:25) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

No one can add to what Jesus did to save us; our past, present,
and future sins are all forgiven, and Jesus is with the Father as a
sign that our sins are forgiven...

If you are a believing Christian, remember Christ has paid the 
price for your sins once and for all (see Heb. 9:24-28).

Christ makes perpetual intercession before God for us. Christ's
continuous presence in heaven with the Father assures us that
our sins have been paid for and forgiven (see Ro. 8:33, 34;
Heb. 2:17, 18; 4:15, 16; 9:24)...

This wonderful assurance frees us from guilt and from fear of failure...

Our Prayer for Today:
Thank You Lord, for the assurance of salvation. Thank Your
love and willingness to go the way of the cross in my place...
Thank you for the freedom from the guilt, and the fear of failure
that Satan would attempt to lay on me...Help me to become a 
better witness each day...Amen.

Keep looking up with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
