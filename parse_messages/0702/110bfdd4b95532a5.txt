GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Burn the candles, use the nice sheets, wear the fancy lingerie.
Don't save it for a special occasion. Today is special.

Our Meditation for Today:

We want each of you to show the same diligence to the very end,
in order to make your hope sure...

We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who
through faith and patience inherit what has been promised...(Heb. 6:11, 12) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Hope keeps the Christian from becoming lazy or feeling bored.
Like an athlete, train hard and run well, remembering the reward
that lies ahead...

Remember Phil 3:14, I press on toward the goal to win the prize 
for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray for continued strength and faithfulness
in order that I may one day receive the prize You have prepared for
me. Continue to bless and strengthen my e-mail friends I pray in
Jesus name...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather...
