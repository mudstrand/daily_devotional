GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~You can get through anything if you stay put in today.

Our Meditation for Today:

Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces 
a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing 
of God...

But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in 
danger of being cursed. In the end it will be burned...(Heb. 6:7, 8) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Land that produces a good crop receives loving care, but land that
produces thistles and thorns has to be burned so the farmer can start 
over...

An unproductive Christian life falls under God's condemnation...

We are not saved by our deeds or conduct, but what we do is
the evidence of our faith...


Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I come to you seeking sensitivity and
obedience that I would live a life of Christ-like love and obedience...
I pray for a loving relationship with You and all other believers...
Bless my e-mail friends again today with good health and the 
strength to live another day...

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
