GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Always choose life...

Our Meditation for Today:

The former regulation is set aside because it was weak
and useless...

(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is 
introduced, by which we draw near to God...(Heb. 7:18, 19) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

The law was never meant to save people, but to point out sin (Ro. 3:20; 5:20)
and to point toward Christ (as we see by Gal. 3:24, 25). Salvation comes
through Christ, whose sacrifice brings forgiveness of our sins...

Being ethical, working diligently to help others, and giving to charitable causes 
are all commendable, but all of our good deeds cannot save us or make us 
right with God. There is a "better hope."

Our Prayer for Today:
Most Gracious Heavenly Father, by Your grace we can
inherit eternal life for which I am eternally thankful. May
Your grace flow freely and bring to repentance those who
are searching...Bless all my e-mail friends today with the
peace that passeth all understanding...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
