GOOD MORNING!!!~~~~~~~(food for thought)~~~Compliment three people today

Our Meditation for Today:
You will roll them up like a robe; like a garment they will be changed.
But You (Christ) remain the same, and Your years will never end...(Heb. 1:12) NIV 

Our Thought for Today:
What does it mean that Christ is changeless ("You will remain the same")?

It means that Christ's character will never change...He persistently shows 
His love to us...He is always fair, just, and merciful to us who are so undeserving.

Be thankful that Christ is changeless; He will always help you when you need it
and offer goodness when you fall...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for being changeless, in a world where
nothing ever seems to remain the same...I thank You for Your grace and 
mercy which is new every day...Forgive me when I stumble along lives path- 
way...Help me to remain sensitive to Your Holy Spirit's leading, I pray these 
things in the name of Jesus...Amen.

Keep looking up, if you believe you will achieve...
You're in the prayers of to who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
