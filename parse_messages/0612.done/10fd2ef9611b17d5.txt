GOOD MORNING!!!~~~~~~(food for thought)~~~Over-tip the breakfast waitresses

Our Meditation for Today:
You made Him a little lower than the angels; You crowned Him with
glory and honor and put everything under His feet. In putting everything 
under Him, God left nothing that is not subject to Him. Yet at present we 
do not see everything subject to Him...(Heb. 2:7, 8) NIV

Our Thought for Today:
Yes God has put Jesus in charge of everything, and Jesus revealed himself to us.
We do not see Jesus reigning on earth as of yet, but we can picture Him in His
heavenly glory...

When you are confused by present events and anxious about the future, remember
Jesus' true position and authority. He is Lord of all, and one day He will rule on earth
as He now does in heaven...

This truth can give stability to your decisions day by day...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for not giving you the honor You
so richly deserve. I long for the day that You will rule here on earth,
and all will live in peace...Amen.

Keep looking up, if you believe you will receive...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
