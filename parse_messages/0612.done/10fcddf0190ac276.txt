GOOD MORNING!!!~~~~~~(food for thought)~~~Remember other people's birthdays

Our Meditation for Today:.........(follow up of vs. 3)
God also testified to it by signs, wonders, and various miracles, 
and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to His will...(Heb. 2:4) NIV

Our Thought for Today:
"God testified to the message of salvation" this is a continuation of vs. 3.
those who had heard Jesus speak and then has passed on His words also
had the truth of their words confirmed by "signs and wonders and various 
miracles and by giving gifts of the Holy Spirit."

In the book of Acts, miracles and gifts of the Spirit authenticated the Good 
News wherever it was preached (see Acts 9:31ff; 14:1ff).

Paul who discussed spiritual gifts in Ro. 12, I Cor. 12-14 and Eph. 4, taught
that their purpose is to build up the church, making it strong and mature.

When this is fulfilled we know that God is truly present. As we receive God's 
gifts, we should thank Him for them and put them to use in the church...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the message of salvation, I pray
that I would always be sensitive of my need of a Savior. I pray that I would
use my gifts wisely to further Your kingdoms work...I pray this all in the name 
of Jesus...Amen.

Keep looking up, if you believe you will achieve...
You're in the prayers of two who care.
