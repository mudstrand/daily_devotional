GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Our deeds~~actions, speak volumes about our heart...

Our Meditation for Today:

It is not as though God's word had failed. For not all who are 
descended from Israel are Israel...

Nor because they are his descendents are they all Abraham's 
children. On the contrary, "It is Through Isaac that your offspring 
will be reckoned...

In other words, it is not the natural children who are God's children,
but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's 
offspring...(Ro. 9:6-8) NIV

The Lesson to be Learned:

We should remember that the beautiful covenant promises that
we have in God's Word originally came to Abraham...

The "Covenant people," the true children of Abraham, are not just
his biological descendents. They are those who trust God and in what
Jesus Christ has done for them (Ro. 2:9: Gal. 3:7)...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray for the faithfulness to walk
in the Light of Christ. I pray for a sensitivity to Your Holy
Spirit's guidance. Forgive me Lord for my sins of thought,
word, and deed...Instill in me a Christ-like attitude...Amen.

Keep looking up, trusting in His loving kindness...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
