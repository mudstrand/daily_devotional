Have A Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~He is but a prayer away

Our Meditation for Today:

The righteousness that is by faith says: "Do not say in your heart,
'Who will ascend into heaven?' (that is to bring Christ down)

"or 'Who will descend into the deep?' (that is, to bring Christ up 
from the dead)...

But what does it say? "The word is near you; it is in your mouth 
and in your heart," that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming...
(Ro. 10:6-8) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul adapts Moses' farewell challenge from Deut. 30:11-14
to apply to Christ...

Christ has provided our salvation through His incarnation
(God in human form) and resurrection...

God's salvation is right in front of us. He will come to you wherever
we are. All we need to do is to respond and accept His gift of 
salvation...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the gift of all gifts,
the gift of salvation that is ours merely by faith. Lord I
believe, help my faith to grow to where I leave all things
in Your hands...Amen.

Keep looking up, in Him all things are possible...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
