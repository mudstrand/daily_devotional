GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~God looks at the heart, not the
outer appearance...

Our Meditation for Today:

For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: "I raised you up for this very purpose,
that I might display My power in you and that My name might be proclaimed 
in all the earth."

Therefore God has mercy on whom He wants to have mercy, and He hardens 
whom He wants to harden...(Ro. 9:17, 18) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul quotes from Ex. 8:16 where God foretold how Pharaoh would be 
used to declare God's power...

Paul uses this argument to show that salvation was God's work, not 
people's.

God's judgment on Pharaoh's sin was to harden his heart, to confirm
his disobedience, so that the consequences of his rebellion would be
his own punishment...

Don't allow rebellion be the cause of separation between you and God...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, do to our sinful flesh I have often 
sinned against You. Forgive me for these sins so that I
do not become separated from You. I pray that our Nation
would once again seek to put You first in all that it does...Amen.

Keep looking up, and seek His grace...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
