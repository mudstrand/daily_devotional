HAVE A BLESSED DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~It is by grace that we are saved...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

I ask then: Did God reject His people? By no means! I am an
Israelite myself, a descendent of Abraham, from the tribe of 
Benjamin...

God did not reject His people, whom He foreknew. Don't you know
what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah, how he appealed
to God against Israel:

"Lord, they have killed Your prophets and torn down Your altars; I am 
the only one left, and they are trying to kill me"?

And what was God's answer to him? "I have reserved for Myself seven
thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal."

So to at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace...(Ro. 11:1-5) NIV

The Lesson To Be Learned:

Yes God chose the Jews ("His own people") to be the people through
whom the rest of the world could find salvation...

But this did not mean that the entire Jewish nation would be saved; only
those who were faithful to God were considered true Jews (Ro. 11:5)...

We are save through faith in Christ, not because we are part of a nation,
religion, or family...

The question is, on whom or what are you trusting for salvation???

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for not always putting You first 
in my life. Help to become more Christ-like in my attitude and life...
Bless our nation, citizens and troops and keep them safe...Amen.

Keep looking up, He wants to be first in your life...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
