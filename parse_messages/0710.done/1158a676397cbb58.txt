GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~The fear of the Lord is to hate evil...

Our Meditation for Today:

(God's sovereign choice)~~~
God promised: "At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah 
will have a son"...

Not only that but Rebekah's children had one and the same father,
our father Isaac...

Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad~
in order that God's purpose in election might stand:

not by works but by Him who calls~she was told, "The older will 
serve the younger...(Ro. 9:8-11) NIV

What Is To Be Learned From This:

The Jews were proud of the fact that their lineage came from Isaac,
whose mother was Sarah (Abraham's legitimate wife), rather than
Ishmael, whose mother was Hagar (Sarah's servant...

Paul makes it very clear that no one can claim to be chosen by God
because of his or her heritage or good deeds...

God freely chooses to save whom-ever He wills...

In the doctrine of election we are taught that God's sovereign choice to 
save us, is by His goodness and mercy, not by our own merit...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your goodness and mercy.
I truly thank You that my salvation does not depend upon my good 
deeds, for they are but filthy rags. Help me to walk in the way of 
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, trusting in His finished work on
the cross...Keep our nation, its citizens and our troops safe. Bless 
all my e-mail friends with good health and safety...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is our help in the time of trouble...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
