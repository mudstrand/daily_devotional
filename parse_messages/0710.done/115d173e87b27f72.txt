Have A Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~

Our Meditation for Today:

Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the
message is heard through the Word of Christ...

But I asked: Did they not hear? of course the did: "Their voice
has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the
world."

Again I asked: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says, 
"I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; I will
make you angry by a nation that has no understanding."

And Isaiah boldly says, "I was found by those who did not seek Me; 
I revealed Myself to those who did not ask Me...(Ro. 10:17-20) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Many Jews who looked for the Messiah refused to believe in Him 
when He came...

God offered His salvation to the Gentiles ("other nations" and 
"people who were not looking for Me");

We need to remember that many Gentiles didn't even know about a 
Messiah, but they found Him and believed in Him...

There are some religious people who are spiritually blind, while those
who have never been in a church are sometimes the most responsive
to God's message...

Because appearances are deceiving, and we can't see into people's
hearts, beware of judging beforehand, who will respond to the God 
News and who will not...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me when I judge unfairly.
Help me to turn that over to You. Open my eyes that I 
may see glimpses of truth you have for me...Amen.

Keep looking up, and receive showers of blessing...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
