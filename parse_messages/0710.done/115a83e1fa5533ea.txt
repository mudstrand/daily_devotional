GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~We will never merit eternal life...

Our Meditation for Today:

What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue 
righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith;

But Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained it.

Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by 
works. They stumbled over the "stumbling stone."

As it is written: "See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes men to stumble
and a rock that makes them fall, and the one who trusts in Him will
never be put to shame." (Ro. 9:30-33) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Sometimes we are like these people, trying to get right with God
by keeping His laws.

We may think that attending church, doing church work, giving
offerings, and being nice will be enough. After all, we've played
by the rules, haven't we?

But Paul's words sting~~this approach never succeeds. Paul
explains that God's plan is not for those who try to earn His favor
by being good; it is for those who realize that they can never be
good enough and so must depend on Christ...

We can be saved only by putting our faith in what Jesus has done.
If we do that we will never be disappointed...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the Love of Your Son,
who took my place on the cross for my sins. I thank You that 
even my faith is a gift from You. Forgive me for the times I 
have strive to be a better person with the idea that, that would 
merit eternal life...Amen.

Keep looking up, your salvation draws near...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
