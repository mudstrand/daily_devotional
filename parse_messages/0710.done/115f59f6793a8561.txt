HAVE A BLESSED DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~You have been adopted into 
the family of God.

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who
fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in His kindness. Otherwise
you also will be cut off.

And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to
graft them in again...

After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary
to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will
these, the natural branches be grafted into there own olive tree! (Ro. 11:22-24) NIV

What We Should Glean From This:

To "continue to trust in His kindness" refers to steadfast perseverance in faith...

Steadfastness is a proof of the reality of faith and by-product of salvation ~~
not a means to it...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your loving-kindness.
Help me to remain steadfast in trust and faith in You. Help
me to have a Christ-like love for all man-kind. Help me to
be a better witness for You...Amen.

Keep looking up, He cares for you...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
