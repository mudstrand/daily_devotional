GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Remember He sees and hears everything we do and say!!!

Our Meditation for Today:

When Paul mentioned the people of "his own race" he was referring to 
the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine 
glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and
the promises...

Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry
of Christ, who is God over all, forever praised! Amen...(Ro. 9:4, 5) NIV

What Can We Learn From This?

What we should always remember is, that the Jews are God's 
chosen people. The Jews viewed God's choosing of Israel in
the Old Testament as being like adoption...

They were undeserving and without rights as natural children~~
Yet God adopted them and granted them the status of His sons 
and daughters...

But lets also remember (2 Cor. 5:17, 18) Therefore if anyone is in
Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, and the new has 
come! 

All this is from God who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and 
gave us the ministry of reconciliation...

Those who accept Christ, and become Christians have become new 
people on the inside~~The Holy Spirit gives them new life, and they 
are not the same anymore...

They are re-created (new creations) living in vital union with Christ (Co. 2:6, 7).

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I know that I am undeserving of being called
your child, but I do believe in the finished work of Christ on the cross
thus making me a new creature. I thank You also for the work of the
Holy Spirit which gives new life so that I can be reconciled to You.
I thank You for the union with Christ that is so vital in my life...Amen.

Keep looking up, it is vital for our union with Him...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
