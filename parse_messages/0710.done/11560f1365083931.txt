I just got this possible live saving e-mail and changed my cell phone setting asap. The locator was turned off, without my knowledge, on my new phone prior to this e-mail. Please spread the word.




Subject: FW: Cell Phone Location - please read!!
this is a good tip....


You may remember that a young woman was recently abducted from a Target
parking lot in Overland Park, a suburb of Kansas City. 

Her body was discovered many miles away in Missouri. They were able to locate her
by the sequence of cell phone towers that picked up her cell phone location.


She had not attempted to dial out, but when her family was trying to call her the towers could sense her phone. 

Sadly, the authorities were not able to reach her in time. However, they were able to locate her body
which was in an area where they never would have searched without the cell phone tower information. 

Below is information from my daughter-in-law who lives in Kansas City.

The cell phone "locator" can be either set on "E911" in which case you must dial out to be located, or it can be set to be on
all the time. 

I called my cell phone company and was assured there is no negative consequence (like higher battery use) from having it on
all the time. 

With it on all the time you can be located by emergency services through the police if you fail to respond (sick, injured or worse). 

I found that on my phone "location" was not on. I turned it on so my phone can be traced. 

See below for more info that was sent to me by someone here at work: ALL cell phones have this feature. It's called Location. It's
under the : Settings tool. (on my phone it's under Settings, System, Location).
Once you turn this on, THEN your phone is traceable (select "Location On" instead of "E911 Only"). 

To stay safe, everyone needs to check their phone and turn this on!!! 

Please pass the word to everyone you know.
This is some good information that everybody should have.
