Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul says: "I am talking to you Gentiles in-as-much as I am the apostle 
to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry

in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and 
save some of them.

For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their
acceptance be but life from the dead..." (Ro. 11:13-15) NIV

Here Is What We Should Realize From This:

Paul was an appointed apostle to the Gentiles. Here he reminds 
his Jewish brothers and sisters of this fact...

He was hoping that they too would want to be saved...

The Jews had rejected God's offer, and so the Gentiles were offered
salvation ~~ But when a Jews comes to Christ, there is great rejoicing,
as if a dead person had come back to life...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the offer of eternal life.
Help me to always remember to give thanks for this wonderful 
gift. I pray for the safety of our nation, its citizens and our troops.
Bless my e-mail friends with good health and safety...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is the light of the world...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
