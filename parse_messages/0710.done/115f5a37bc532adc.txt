NEW USE FOR VICKS WOW! I was raised, and raised my kids with
Vicks. How come I never knew this? I can't wait for my next cough.
Amazing! READ IT ALL.

It works 100 percent of the time, although the scientists at the
Canada Research council (who discovered it) aren't sure why.

To stop nighttime coughing in a child (or an adult, as we found out
personally),
Put Vicks Vapor Rub generously on the bottom of the feet at bedtime and
Then cover with socks. Even persistent, heavy, deep coughing will stop in
about five minutes And stay stopped for many, many hours of relief.

This works 100 Percent of the time and is more effective in children than
even very Strong prescription cough medicines. In addition it is extremely
Soothing and comforting and they will sleep soundly. I heard the head of The
Canada Research Council describe these findings on the part of their
Scientists when they were investigating the effectiveness and usage of
Prescription cough medicines in children as compared to alternative
Therapies like acupressure. I just happened to tune in to a.m. Radio And
picked up this guy talking about why cough medicines in kids
often do more harm than good due to the chemical makeup of these strong
drugs, So I listened. It was a surprising finding and found to be more
effective than prescribed medicines for children at bedtime and in Addition
to have a soothing and calming effect on sick children who then went on to
sleep soundly. My wife tried it on herself when she had a Very deep constant
and persistent cough a few weeks ago and it worked 100 percent! She said it
felt like a warm blanket had enveloped
her. The coughing stopped in a few minutes, and believe me, this was A deep
(incredibly annoying!), every few seconds, uncontrollable cough, And she
slept cough-free for hours every night she used it.. If you have
Grandchildren, pass it on. If you end up sick, try it yourself and you will
be absolutely amazed by The effect.
