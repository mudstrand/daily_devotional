Tue. 24/09~~~food for thought~~~Are you willing to make sacrifices for your Lord?

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Paul says: "I will very gladly spend and be spent for
your souls..." (2 Cor. 12:15)

Our Lesson for Today:

Once "the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the 
Holy Spirit," we should deliberately begin to identify ourselves 
with Jesus Christ's interests and purposes in the lives others (Ro. 5:5).

Let us never forget that Jesus has an interest in every individual
person. We have no right in our Christian service to be guided by
our own interests and desires...

In fact, this is one of the greatest tests in our relationship with Jesus Christ.

The delight of sacrifice is that we lay down our life for our friend Jesus,
(look at Jn. 15:13). We don't throw our life away, but we should willingly
and deliberately lay it down for Him and His interests in other people...

When someone thinks that to develop a holy life he/she must always 
be alone with God, he/she is no longer of any use to others. This is like 
putting ones self on a pedestal and isolating ones self from the rest of
society...

So, are you willing to sacrifice your earthly life for eternal life with Christ?

Prayer Suggestion:
Before praying read (1 Cor. 9:22 then pray that you would be willing
to lay down your life for Christ's interests.
