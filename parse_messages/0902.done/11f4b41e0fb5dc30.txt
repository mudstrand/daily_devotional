if some else copied it...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Let us not love with words or tongue
but with actions and in truth...(1 Jn. 3:18)

Jesus said, "I have set you an example
that you should do as I have done for you."
(Jn. 13:15)

Our Lesson for Today: (being role models)

Little boys are most generally the hope of the next generation.
Because they are the fathers of tomorrow. They must know who 
they are and what they are to do. they must see their role model 
in action...

That is how they will know what it means to be a male. That puts 
the ball in my court and yours...

Its our job to save the boys. So the question is, How are we going
to do that???

Lets ask ourselves, What do I specifically need to do in order to 
train them to become leaders of their families?

Here are some suggestions as to being a model for them...

First we need to model the importance of:

Knowing and obeying Jesus Christ,
knowing and displaying godly character,
knowing and loving my wife,
knowing and loving my children, and
knowing my gifts and abilities...

Then we can work hard and effectively in an area of strength,
rather than weakness, and contribute effectively to the lives
of others, and have a little fun at the same time...

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray for the ability to live up to the examples listed above...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
