Our Bible Verses for Today:

May He give you the desire of your heart and make all your
plans succeed...

We will shout for joy when you are victorious and will lift up
our banners in the name of our God. May the LORD grant
all your requests...(Ps. 20:4, 5)

Our Lesson for Today:

With everything working in his favor, it seemed Solomon would
gratefully follow God. His prayer of dedication for the temple in
1 Kg. 8 is one of the most majestic ever prayed...

Yet by the end of his reign Solomon had squandered away nearly 
every advantage. Along the way he lost sight of the original vision
to which God had called him...

Success in the kingdom of this world had crowded out interest in
the kingdom of God. The brief shinning vision of a covenant nation 
faded away, and God withdrew His sanction...

Yes Solomon got what ever he wanted, especially when it came to
symbols of power and status. Gradually he depended less on God 
and more on the props around him:
The world's largest harem -
a house twice the size of the temple -
an army well-stocked with chariots-
a strong economy...

His problems came as he enjoyed the world's good gifts more
thus he thought less about the Giver...

Prayer Suggestion:
Let us pray for a greater focus on the Giver 
and less on the gifts...
