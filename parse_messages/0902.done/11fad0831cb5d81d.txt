Wed. 25/09~~~food for thought~~~How deep is your spiritual perseverance...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

"Be still, and know that I am God..." (Ps. 46:10)

Our Lesson for Today:

Perseverance is more than endurance. It is endurance combined with absolute
assurance and certainty that what we are looking for is going to happen...

Perseverance means more than just hanging on, which may be only exposing fear
of letting go and falling...

Perseverance is our supreme effort of refusing to believe that our hero is going to
be conquered...

Remember that our call to perseverance is not to merely hang on and do nothing,
but to work deliberately, knowing with certainty that God will never be defeated...

If our hopes seem to be experiencing disappointment right now, it simply means
that our hopes are being purified...

Every hope or dream of the human mind will be fulfilled if it is noble and of God.
BUT one of the greatest stresses in life is the stress of waiting for God.

He brings fulfillment, "because you have kept My commandment to persevere."
(Rev. 3:10)

Prayer for Today:
Pray that you will be able to continue to persevere spiritually.

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
