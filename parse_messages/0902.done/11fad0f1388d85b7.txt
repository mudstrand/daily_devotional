Thx D. G.





I'm not breaking this one. If I get it a 1000 times, I'll forward it a 1000 times!

Let us pray...
























Prayer chain for our Military... Don't break it!

Please send this on after a short prayer. Prayer for our soldiers Don't break it!

Prayer: 

'Lord, hold our troops in your loving hands Protect them as they protect us Bless them and their families for the selfless acts they perform for us in our 

time of need. Amen.' 






I would like to suggest that we pray not only for their safety and well being but for Salvation for those who do not know the Lord. It would be horrible if anyone should perish without God's saving Grace.

Prayer Request: When you receive this, please stop for a moment and say a prayer for our troops around the world.
There is nothing attached. Just send this to people in your address book. Do not let it stop with you. Of all the gifts you could give a Marine, Soldier, Sailor, Airman, & others deployed in harm's way, prayer is the very best one.

GOD BLESS YOU FOR PASSING IT ON!
