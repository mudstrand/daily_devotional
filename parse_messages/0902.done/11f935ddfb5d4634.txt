Fri. 20/09~~~food for thought~~~Taking the initiative against daydreaming...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

I will not speak with you much longer, for the prince of this world is coming.
He has no hold on Me,

BUT the world must learn that I love the Father and that I do exactly what
my Father has commanded Me. "Come now; let us leave."

Our Lesson for Today:

Day-dreaming about something in order to do it properly is right,
BUT day-dreaming about it when we should be doing it is wrong...

In this passage, after having said these wonderful things to His
disciples, we might have expected our Lord to tell them to go
away and meditate over them all. BUT Jesus never allowed idle
day-dreaming...

When our purpose is to seek God and to discover His will for us.
day-dreaming is right and acceptable. BUT when our inclination
is to spend time day-dreaming over what we have already been
told to do, it is unacceptable and God's blessing is never on it...

If we are quietly waiting before God after He has said to us 
"Come aside by yourselves..." then that is meditation before Him
to seek His will (Mk 6:31)...

We need to be cautious, though, of giving in to mere day-dreaming
once God has spoken...

Allow Him to be the source of all your dreams, joys, and delights,
and be careful to go and obey what He has said...

Day-dreaming after God has spoken is an indication that we do 
not trust Him...

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray for Christ-like obedience and love...
