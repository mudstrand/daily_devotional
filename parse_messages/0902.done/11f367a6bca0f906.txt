Mon. 02/09~~~(food for thought)~~~Before they call I will answer; while they
are still speaking, I will hear...(Isa. 65:24)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Call to Me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable
things you do not know...(Jer. 33:3)

The Lord is far from the wicked but He hears the prayer of the
righteous...(Pro. 15:29)

Our Lesson for Today:

The Biblical Christian can only pray empty-handed, as the thirteenth-
century Dominican preacher William Peraldus expressed it...

Our hope depends not on the right technique or the proper phrase
or gesture, which borders on magic, but on the promises of God...

As I see it, true prayer is neither mystical or some ritual observance
nor some philosophical reflection. What it should be is an outpouring
of the soul before a living God, a crying to God "out of the depths."

Such a prayer can only be uttered by one who has been convicted of 
sin by the grace of God and moved to confession by the Holy Spirit...

True prayer is an encounter with our Holy God in which we realize not
only our creatureliness and our guilt but also the joy of knowing that our 
sins are forgiven through the atoning death of the divine Savior, Jesus
Christ...

In such an encounter, we are impelled not only to bow before God and
seek His mercy but also to offer thanksgiving for grace that goes out
to undeserving sinners...

Prayer Suggestion:
Let us continually give thanks for His grace and mercy
to such as we...
