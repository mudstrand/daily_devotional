I agree with this 100%



























JOB - URINE TEST 



(Whoever wrote this one deserves a HUGE pat on the back!) 
Joe, the average worker says; Like a lot of folks in this state, I have a job. I 
work, they pay me. I pay my taxes and the government distributes my taxes as it sees fit. In 
order to get that paycheck, I am required to pass a random urine test with which I have no problem. 
What I do have a problem with is the distribution of my taxes to people who don't have 
to pass a urine test. Shouldn't one have to pass a urine test to get a welfare check because I have 
to pass one to earn it for them? Please understand, I have no problem with helping people 
get back on their feet. I do, on the other hand, have a problem with helping someone sitting on 
their lazy butts, doing drugs, while I work. . . . 
Can you imagine how much money the state would save if people had to pass a urine test to get a 
public assistance check? Pass this along if you agree or simply delete if you don't. Hope you all 
will pass it along, though . . . Something has to change in this country -- and soon!!!!! >> 
*guess we could title that program, 'Urine or You're Out'. *
