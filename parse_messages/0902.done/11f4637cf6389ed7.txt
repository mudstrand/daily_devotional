Subject: Super Bowl!!


Hans received a free ticket to the Super Bowl. Unfortunately, when he got there his seat was so high up, he felt as though he was watching the game from an airplane. He can see what appears to be an empty seat way down towards the field and figures he's got nothing to lose. He manages to find his way down and asks the fella sitting there if the seat was taken. The gentleman said no and invited Hans to sit down. Of course Hans can't believe his luck! He turns to the man and says "I can't believe someone would have this seat for the Super Bowl and then not show up!" The gentleman answers, "To be honest, the seat is mine. For 30 years me and my beloved wife have been coming to the Super Bowl, but unfortunately she passed away." Hans was heartbroken over the story and questioned sympathetically "well couldn't you have found a close friend or relative to come with you today?" "Not really" replied the man, "they're all at the funeral."
