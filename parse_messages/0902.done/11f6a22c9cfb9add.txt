Fri. 13/09~~~food for thought~~~Always give thanks to God for His indescribable gift...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Give thanks to the Lord, call upon His name; make known among the nations
what He has done...(1 Chron. 16:8)

Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise; give thanks to
Him and praise His name...(Ps. 100:4)

Our Lesson for Today:

The magic of a thankful spirit is that it has the power to replace:

* Anger with love
* Resentment with happiness
* Fear with faith
* Worry with peace
* The desire to dominate with the wish to play on a team
* Self-preoccupation with concern for the needs of others
* Guilt with an open door to forgiveness
* Jealousy with joy at another's success
* Lack of creativity with inspired productivity
* Inferiority's with dignity
* A lack of love with an abundance of self-sharing...

When we feel down we may find it hard to give thanks.
But we can take heart, because in all things God works
for the good of those who love Him...

We don't need to thank God for our problems, but for the strength 
He is building in us through the difficult experiences of our life...

We can be sure that God's perfect love will see us through...

Prayer suggestion:
Let us continue to pray for the magic of a thankful spirit...

Ps. Sorry about you not getting last weeks devotionals
but I was having computer problems...It would forward
messages but not send out new messages...
