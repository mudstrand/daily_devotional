Mon. 2/09~~~food for thought~~~Have you felt the pain inflicted by the Lord?

Our Bible Verse for Today:

The third time He said to him, "Simon son of John, do you love Me?"
Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love Me?"
He said, "Lord You know all things; you know I love You."

Our Lesson for Today:

Have you ever felt pain, inflicted by the Lord, at the very center of your being,
deep down in the most sensitive area of your life???

The devil never inflicts pain there, and neither can sin nor human emotions...

Nothing can cut through to that part of our being but the Word of God. Peter was 
grieved because He said to him the third time, 'Do you love Me? Yet he was 
awakened to the fact that at the center of his personal life he was devoted to Jesus...

AND then he began to see what Jesus' patient questioning meant. There was not 
the slightest bit of doubt left in Peter's mind; he could never be deceived again.
AND there was no need for an impassioned response; NO need for immediate OR
an emotional display...

It was a revelation to him to realize how much he did love the Lord, and with 
amazement he simply said, "Lord, You know all things." Oh, the wonder of the 
patient directness and skill of Jesus Christ with Peter!!!

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray that you will be ready to answer Jesus in the affirmative
when He backs you into a corner with the question, "Do you love Me?"
