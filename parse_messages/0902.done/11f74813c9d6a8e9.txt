Sat. 14/09~~~food for thought~~~Love your neighbor as thyself...Happy Valentine's Day

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Six days do your work, but on the seventh day do not work,
so that your ox and your donkey may rest and the slave born 
in your household, and the alien as well, may be refreshed...
(Ex. 23:12)

Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him
as a gift, but as an obligation...(Ro. 3:4)

Our Lesson for Today:

I feel that many people today are sacrificing themselves on the 
alter of work...

What they bring upon themselves is symptoms such as anger,
chemical dependencies and loneliness in a pursuit of self-
fulfillment through career success...

In this pursuit one begins to worship his/her career as though it were
a god...But like all other idols, work is important in the face of a true 
human need... 

Now I have sat with people on there last days here on earth, who had
done exceptionally well in business, yet I watched them cry as they 
told me their tragic stories, some with personal lives shattered, others 
with families in a shambles...

None of their professional accomplishments, none of the machinery
of their companies, none of their wealth was of the slightest help. They 
were all in trouble and their god was impotent...

I felt sorry for these people. BUT I also respected the fact that only by
the grace of God, the same thing could have happened to me as it had 
to these people...

My conclusion is that this will always happen when we take God's gift 
of work and serve it rather than Christ...

Prayer Suggestion:
Let us pray that we focus our attention more on the One who
gives us the strength and health to hold a job to support our-
selves...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
