Wed. 04/09~~~food for thought~~~Love one another deeply, from the heart...(1 Pet. 1:22)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of
one body you were called to peace. And be thankful...

Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish
one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns and spiritual
songs with gratitude in your hearts to God...

And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the 
Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him... (Col. 3:15-17)

Our Lesson for Today:

You receive what you give out. You want a loving God? Then be loving.
You want a merciful God? Then be merciful. Want God to forgive you?
Then be forgiving...

Want God to condemn you? The be a judgmental person. Want to
put yourself above the rest of the world? Then get ready for a God 
who is going to strain out every judgmental thought you've ever had 
and measure all the thoughts and intents of your hidden heart by the 
same standard...

We need to realize as Christians that however acceptable our lives 
may be for the general audience, we still posses an R-rated heart, 
and we are as good as dead if we want God to meet us on any other 
ground than His grace and forgiveness...

The Joy of this truth is that once I can believe that forgiveness for 
myself, then I can believe it for anybody. I have new eyes to see 
beyond my neighbor's sin and love him or her with the love of Christ...

Prayer Suggestion:
Let us continue to pray for a more loving heart
so as not to be so judgmental...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
