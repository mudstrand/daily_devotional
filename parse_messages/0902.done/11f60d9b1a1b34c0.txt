Tue. 02/09~~~food for thought~~~Be strong in the Lord and His mighty power...(Eph 6:10)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

I will refresh the weary and satisfy the faint...(Jer. 41:10)

Therefore, since the promise of entering His rest still stands,
let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen 
short of it...(Heb. 4:1)

Our Lesson for Today:

Too much stress, especially stress that is not relieved by times
of rest and renewal, can harm us physically, mentally, and spiritually...

To a great extent Christians are caught up in the same rat race as
everyone else. To often we let our values become distorted and 
we don't see life clearly from God's point of perspective...

To often we lose some of our distinctiveness; and our lives almost
become identical to those people who are not committed to Christ.
as a result, I believe we are violating the very basic laws that God
has set down for our bodies...

The sad thing is we may be doing all this in the name of the One who
came to save us from our need to earn salvation...

Christian must wake up to the fact that they are burning themselves out
just as quickly as every one else...

So let us return to Him and receive His promise to refresh us...

Prayer Suggestion:
Let us pray that He would refresh us with His sustaining power...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
