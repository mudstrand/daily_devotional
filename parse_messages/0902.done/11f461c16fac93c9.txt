Thur. 05/09~~~food for thought~~~Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for 
righteousness, for they will be filled...(Mt. 5:6)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Do your best to present yourself to God as one approve, a workman
who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word 
of truth...(2 Tim. 3:15)

Being confident of this, that He who began a good work in you will
carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus...(Phil. 1:6)

Our Lesson for Today:

Very few Believers choose to drift; seldom do Christians plan to be
lukewarm. BUT poor performance undermines confidence and failure
causes discouragement...

Temptation, even when overcome, leaves us battle-scared and weary.
sometimes it is difficult to tell the difference between victory and defeat
because issues are never clear-cut and our successes never total...

When one has struggled through the testing time and finally has endured,
it seldom feels like triumph. Someone has to help us at our time of
struggle. We need a brother in our hour of trial, and especially when 
we fail...

Otherwise we will fall into the discouragement of trying harder or of
never quite measuring up. The subtle shift from trusting Christ to our 
own self-efforts will rob us of hope and joy...

We need to know that we are known, understood and love by someone
who has marked out the path, has won the victory and is with us on the
way...That someone is Jesus...

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray that the love of knowledge of Christ would abound more and more
in you day by day. Pray that you become able to discern what is best and
be pure and blameless until the day of Christ...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
