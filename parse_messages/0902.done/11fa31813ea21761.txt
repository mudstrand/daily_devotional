YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE



You are My Sunshine, My only Sunshine' (Be prepared to get watery eyes!)

Like any good mother, when Karen found out that another baby was on the
way, she did what she could to help her 3-year-old son, Michael, prepare
for a new sibling.


They found out that the new baby was going be a girl, and day after 
day, night after night, Michael sang to his sister in mommy's tummy. 



He was building a bond of love with his little sister before he even 
met her. 



The pregnancy progressed normally for Karen, an active member of the 
Panther Creek United Methodist Church in Morristown , Tennessee . 



In time, the labor pains came. Soon it was every five minutes, every 
three, every minute. But serious complications arose during delivery and 
Karen found herself in hours of labor. 



Would a C-section be required? Finally, after a long struggle, 
Michael's little sister was born. But she was in very serious condition. 



With a siren howling in the night, the ambulance rushed the infant to 
the neonatal intensive care unit at St. Mary's Hospital, Knoxville , 

Tennessee . The days inched by. The little girl got worse. The 
pediatrician had to tell the parents there is very little hope. Be 

prepared for the worst. 



Karen and her husband contacted a local cemetery about a burial plot. 

They had fixed up a special room in their house for their new baby but 
now they found themselves having to plan for a funeral. 

Michael, however, kept begging his parents to let him see his sister. I want to 
sing to her, he kept saying. 



Week two in intensive care looked as if a funeral would come before the 
week was over. 



Michael kept nagging about singing to his sister, but kids are never 
allowed in Intensive Care. Karen decided to take Michael with whether 
they liked it or not. 



If he didn't see his sister right then, he may never see her alive. She 
dressed him in an ove rsized scrub suit and marched him into ICU. I 
looked like a walking laundry basket. 



The head nurse recognized him as a child and bellowed, 'Get that kid 
out of here now. No children are allowed.' The mother rose up strong in 
Karen, and the usually mild-mannered lady glared steel-eyed right into 
the head nurse's face, her lips a firm line. 'He is not leaving until he 
sings to his sister' she stated. 



Then Karen towed Michael to his sister's bedside. 



He gazed at the tiny infant losing the battle to live. 



After a moment, he began to sing. 



In the pure-hearted voice of a 3-year-old, Michael sang: 


'You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me happy when skies 
are gray.' Instantly the baby girl seemed to respond. The pulse rate 
began to calm down and become steady. 



'Keep on singing, Michael,' encouraged Karen with tears in her eyes. 



'You never know, dear, how much I love you, please don't take my 
sunshine away. 



'As Michael sang to his sister, the baby's ragged, strained breathing 
became as smooth as a kitten's purr 'Keep on singing, sweetheart.' 



'The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping, I dreamed I held you in my 
arms'. Michael's little sister began to relax as rest, healing rest, 
seemed to sweep over her. 



'Keep on singing, Michael.' Tears had now conquered the face of the 
bossy head nurse. Karen glowed. 



'You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. Please don't take my sunshine 
away...' 



The next day...the very next day. the little girl was well enough to 
go home 



Woman's Day Magazine called it The Miracle of a Brother's Song. The 
medical staff just called it a miracle. Karen called it a miracle of 
God's love. 



NEVER GIVE UP ON THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE. 



LOVE Life is good. 



Have a Wonderful Day! Just send this to (4) people and see what happens 
on the fourth day. 



Do not break this, please. There is no cost, but lots of rewards 



In God We Trust! 



'The evidence of God's presence far outweighs the proof of His 
absence.'
