07/10/09~~~food for thought~~~Let us no longer live for the flesh,
but for Christ crucified...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of
our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world hath
been crucified unto me, and I unto the world." (Gal 6:14)

Our Lesson for Today:
When Jesus said to His disciples, "Lo, I am with you always,"
It was as the Crucified One, who had shown them His hands 
and His feet, that gave the promise...

And to each one of us who seek to claim the promise, it is of
the first importance that we should realize: it is the crucified 
Jesus who promises, who offers, to be with us every day...

May not this be one reason why we find it so difficult to
expect and enjoy the abiding presence? ~ because we do not glory 
in the Cross by which we are crucified with Him." 

They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its affections and 
lusts ~ and yet how little we have learned that the world has been 
crucified to us and that we are free from its power...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, help us to learn the lesson, that it is You
the crucified Christ, who comes to walk with us every day,
and in whose power we too are to live can say: "I have
been crucified with Christ," "Christ crucified lives in me."
