07/07/09~~~food for thought~~~It is not our ability ~ but our availability that
God wants to use...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Jesus came and told His disciples, "I have been given
complete authority in heaven and on earth." (Mt. 28:18)

Our Lesson for Today:
God gave Jesus authority over heaven and earth...

On the basis of that authority, Jesus told His disciples to make
more disciples as they preached, baptized, and taught...

With this same authority, Jesus still commands us to tell others
the Good News and make them disciples for the Kingdom...

Let us remember, that this power is never meant to be experienced
as if it were our own...

It is only as Jesus Christ as a living Person dwells and works with 
His divine energy in our own heart and life that there can be power
in our preaching and personal testimony...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I pray that I would be sensitive, to Your calling to 
every believer, to contribute in some small way to share the Word.
