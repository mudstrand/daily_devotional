07/05/09~~~food for thought~~~What we possess by nature must be must be nailed to 
the cross, and we must put on the new nature...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the 
world...(Gal 6:14)

Our Lesson for Today:
I think that it goes without saying, if we stop and think,
'that the world is full of enticements...

Each and every day we are confronted with subtle pressures.
The only way to escape these destructive influences is to ask
God to help crucify our interest in them, just as Paul did...

Let me pose this question to you ~ How much do the interest of 
this world matter to you???

For more on this concept look up (Gal. 2:20 & 5:24)

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for the blessing of the cross,
for it teaches me the worthlessness of my own efforts and the
complete corruption of my own nature...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
