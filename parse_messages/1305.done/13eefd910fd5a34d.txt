Today's Verse: Romans 8:30
<http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ro+8%3A30> Whom He justified,
them He also glorified



Today's Promise:

Here is a precious truth for the believer. You may be poor, or in suffering,
or unknown, but there is encouragement for you if you review your "calling."
As surely as you are God's child today, so surely shall all your trials soon
be at an end, and you shall be rich to all the intents of God's grace. 

Wait awhile, and that weary head shall wear the crown of glory, and that
hand of labor shall grasp the palm-branch of victory. Don't cry over your
troubles, but instead rejoice that one day you will be where "there shall be
neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain."

Remember the portals of heaven stand open for you. If He has called you,
nothing can separate you from His love. Distress cannot sever the bond; the
fire of persecution cannot burn the link; the hammer of hell cannot break
the chain. You are secure; that voice which called you at first, shall call
you yet again from earth to heaven, from death's dark gloom to immortality's
unuttered splendors.

Rest assured, the heart of Him who has justified you beats with infinite
love towards you. You shall soon be with the glorified, where your portion
is.



Prayer: Dear Lord, we look forward to the day when from this world of
grief and sin,

we will be united with You and be eternally shut-in-where we will rest
for 

ever and ever. . .Amen.
