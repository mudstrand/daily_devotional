Today's Verse: Col. 4:2 Devote yourselves to prayer with an alert mind and
a thankful heart.



Today's Message:

This is not the work of one day or one night. It needs to be one with the
will to take the time to 

do some serious thinking in regard to the state and the need of the body of
Christ in which we

belong. . .

BUT once we begin, we will find numerous reasons for the persevering and
yielding to the Holy

Spirit-that He may fit us for the great and blessed work of day by day
praying the twofold prayer, 

for the love of God and Christ to fill the hearts of His people and for the
power of the Holy Spirit

to come down and accomplish God's work in this sinful world. . .



Prayer:

Dear Lord, may we devote ourselves to daily prayer-Fill our hearts with a
love for God and Christ-

Send to us the power of the Holy Spirit to be able to accomplish Your work
in this sinful world. . . Amen
