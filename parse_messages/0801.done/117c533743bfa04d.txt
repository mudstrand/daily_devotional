Good Morning!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~As Christ forgave you, you to must forgive...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Was a man already circumcised when He was called? He should
not become circumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he 
was called? He should not be circumcise...

Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcised is nothing. Keeping
God's commands is what counts...I Cor. 7:18, 19) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

The ceremony of circumcision was an important part of the Jews'
relationship with God. In fact, before Christ came, circumcision
was commanded by God for those who claimed to follow Him
(Gen. 17:9-14)...

But after Christ's death, circumcision was no longer necessary
(Ro. 4:9-11)...

Pleasing God and obeying Him are more important than observing
traditional ceremonies...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father forgive me for not being as 
obedient as You would like, forgive me for falling
short of Your requirements. I pray that You would
help me become more obedient...Amen.

Keep looking up, for the strength to obey...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
