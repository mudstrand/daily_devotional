Thank you JW this was so good I have decided to make it Fri. 11th Devotion.
It reminded me of (I Pet. 5:3, 4) NLT

Don't lord it over people assigned to your care, but lead them by your good
example...(let your bell ring)

and when the head Shepherd comes, your reward will be a never-ending share
in His glory and Honor...

Sent to me by a very dear friend.


This is a most beautiful story and I know you will love it and perhaps pass it on to some friend that is special, just as I have done.






Just up the road from my home is a field, with two horses in it.

From a distance, each horse looks like any other horse. But if
you stop your car, or are walking by, you will notice something
quite amazing...

Looking into the eyes of one horse will disclose that he is blind.
His owner has chosen not to have him put down, but has made
a good home for him.

This alone is amazing.

If you stand nearby and listen, you will hear the sound of a
bell. Looking around for the source of the sound, you will see
that it comes from the smaller horse in the field.

Attached to the horse's halter is a small bell.

It lets the blind friend know where the other horse is, so he can
follow.

As you stand and watch these two friends, you'll see that the
horse with the bell is always checking on the blind horse,
and that the blind horse will listen for the bell and then
slowly walk to where the other horse is, trusting that he will
not be led astray.

When the horse with the bell returns to the shelter of the barn
each evening, it stops occasionally and looks back, making sure
that the blind friend isn't too far behind to hear the bell.

Like the owners of these two horses, God does not throw us
away just because we are not perfect or because we have
problems or challenges.

He watches over us and even brings others into our lives
to help us when we are in need.

Sometimes we are the blind horse being guided by the little
ringing bell of those who God places in our lives.

Other times we are the guide horse, helping others to find
their way....

Good friends are like that... you may not always see them,
but you know they are always there.

Please listen for my bell and I'll listen for yours.
And remember...
be kinder than necessary-
everyone you meet is fighting
some kind of battle.


Keep looking up,
Live simply,
Love generously,
Care deeply,
Speak kindly....
Leave the rest to God



You are in the prayers of two who care...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
