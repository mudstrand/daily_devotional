Have a Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~All good things come from above...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Paul says:
Get rid of the old yeast that you may make a new batch without yeast,
as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed...

Therefore let us keep the festival, not with old yeast, the yeast of
malice and wickedness, but with bread without yeast, the bread
of sincerity and truth...(I Cor.5:7, 8) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

As the Hebrew prepared to leave Egypt, and become free people
once again,they were commanded to prepare bread with out yeast 
because they didn't have time to wait for it to rise...

AND because yeast, was also a symbol for sin, they were commanded
to sweep all of it out of the house...

Christ is our Passover lamb, the perfect sacrifice for sin...
Because He has delivered us from the slavery of sin, we should
have nothing to do with the sins of the past...

Our Prayer for Today.
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me of all my sins. Guide and
direct my life so that I might walk in fellowship with you, all
the days of my life...Amen.

Keep looking up, God's unfailing love is matchless...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
