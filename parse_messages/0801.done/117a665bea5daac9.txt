As many of you know, I have been working for a new company in town called Carol that plans to fundamentally change healthcare delivery by moving towards a consumer driven environment. A big goal for sure, and the effort will require a journey of many steps. To that end, we have completed the first important public step today, Carol.com is live! Over the next few days you should hear and see the media campaign complete with TV spots, radio ads, billboards, and Carol.com decorated buses. (when you see one, tell me what you think, you cannot miss the colors!) :-)

My background includes extensive work in the heatlhcare arena for providers, payers and hospitals, and that has certainly impacted my assessment of Carol. I am really interested in your feedback about this site and the idea of shopping for heatlhcare online. If you have time, and are curious, pop over to the website and let me know what you think.

Below is a more formal announcement that was put together by marketing. 

I hope all is well with you guys.

Carol, the Care Marketplace is live on the Web for the Twin Cities' market effective today! That means the transformation of health care is in your hands. I encourage you to visit our site and register (we're totally HIPAA secure). When you're "in" you can browse and compare services from providers across the full marketplace, view differences in health care options and estimate prices and out of pocket expenses. You've never been able to do this before – Carol is an unbiased source where local health care providers actually compete for your business. It's about time that we can shop and compare health care in the same transparent way we shop for other things in our lives.

We opened the Care Marketplace today with 30 leading Twin Cities' health care providers offering more than 350 care packages—ranging from acne to varicose veins (not that any of you have either!). Now, when you shop for health care at Carol, you'll know what you're buying, what you'll pay and who you'll you see - before you schedule. We'll be adding more tenants (i.e. providers) and products (i.e. care packages) daily so keep coming back – and be sure to tell us what you're looking to shop for so that we can round out the marketplace. 

Consumers do have the power to transform health care; it's as simple as choosing where to spend our health care dollars. Please take the time to visit www.carol.com <http://www.carol.com> in the next week or so and let me know what you think!
