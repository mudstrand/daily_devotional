Have a Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~God's whisper of comfort quiets
the noise of our trials...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
(Yesterdays devotional verse was 6:18 not 7:18)

Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit,
who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are
not your own;

you were bought with a price. Therefore honor God with
your body...(I Cor. 6:19, 20) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

What does Paul mean when he says that your body belongs to God?

Many people say they have the right to do whatever they want with their
bodies. When they say this is a freedom, they are really enslaved to 
their own desires...

When we become Christians, the Holy Spirit comes to live in us, and 
thus we no longer own our bodies...

When we read that God bought us "with a high price" refers to slaves 
purchased at an auction. Christ's death freed us from sin but also 
obligates us to His service...

If you live in a building owned by someone else, you naturally try not to 
violate the building's rules. Because your body belongs to God, you
must not violate His standards of living...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that I would remain sensitive to
Your will so I would not violate Your standards of living. Bless 
all my e-mail friends with good health and safety today...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is coming back...
You are in the Prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
