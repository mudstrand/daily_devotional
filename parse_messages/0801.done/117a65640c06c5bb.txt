Good Morning!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~We are to be Christ's hands and feet
for the spreading of His Word...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Now for the matters you wrote about: It is good for a man not to marry.

But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own
wife, and each woman her own husband...

The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the 
wife to her husband...

For the wives body does not belong to her alone but also to her husband.
In the same way, the husband's body does not belong to him alone but 
also to the wife...(I Cor. 7:1-4) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Sexual temptations are difficult to withstand because they appeal to
the natural desires that God has given us...

Marriage provides God's way to satisfy these natural sexual desires
and to strengthen the partners against temptation...

Married couples have a responsibility to care for each other; so husbands 
and wives should not withhold themselves sexually from one another
but should fulfill each other's needs and desires...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for my sins of thought
word and deed. I thank You Lord for a loving spouse.
Help me to always remain faithful and to have a forgiving 
heart...Amen.

Keep looking up, for strength and forgiveness...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
