Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul speaking says, To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother
has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must
not divorce her...

And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to 
live with her she must not divorce him...

For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife. and
the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband.
Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy...
(I Cor. 7:12-14) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Now because of their desire to serve Christ, some people in the Corinthian
church thought they ought to divorce their pagan spouses and marry Christians...

But we see in these verse that Paul affirms the marriage commitment. God's
ideal is for husbands and wives to stay together ~ even when one spouse is 
not a believer...

The Christian spouse should try to win the other to Christ. YES it would be 
easy to rationalize leaving, BUT Paul makes a strong case for staying with
the unbelieving spouse and being a positive influence on the marriage...

Paul, like Jesus, believed that marriage is permanent (see Mk. 10:1-9).

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for faithful spouses. I thank
You for those who have made a decision to love their spouse
each and every day. Bless all faithful families with Your Spirit's
presence...Amen.

Keep looking up, He gives the power to love...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
