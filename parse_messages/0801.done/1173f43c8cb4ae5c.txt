Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul says, "I care very little if I am judged by you or 
any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself...

My conscience is clear, but that does not make me
innocent. It is the Lord who judges me...

Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time;
wait till the Lord comes. He will bring light on what is 
hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of 
men's hearts. At that time each will receive his praise
from God..." (I Cor.4:3-5) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

It is tempting to judge fellow Christians, evaluating whether
or not they are good followers of Christ. But only God knows 
a person's heart, and He is the only one with the right to judge...

Paul's warning to the Corinthians should also warn us. We are
to confront those who are sinning (see. Cor. 5:12, 13), but we 
need to remember we must not judge who is a better servant 
of Christ. When you judge someone you are really considering 
yourself as better, and that is an arrogant assumption...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, help me to never make the assumption
that I am better than other people. Help me to leave the judging 
up to you...Protect all my e-mail friends from Satan's temptations...Amen

You are in the prayers of two who care...
Keep looking up for godly wisdom...
