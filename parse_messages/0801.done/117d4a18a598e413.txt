Have a Blessed Weekend!!!~~~(I will not be here to send out the Sat. Devo.)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Now let me say this dear brothers and sisters: the time that 
remains is short, so husbands should not let marriage be
their major concern...

Happiness or sadness or wealth should not keep anyone
from doing God's work...

Those in frequent contact with the things of the world should
make good use of them without becoming attached to them,
for this world and all it contains will pass away...(I Cor. 7:29-31) NLT

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul is really urging believers not to regard marriage, home, or
financial security as the ultimate goals of life. As much as possible
we should live unhindered by the cares of the world...

If we get too involved with burdensome mortgages, budgets,
investments, or debts they can hinder our work for the Lord...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, it is so easy to become trapped by
the want for material things, forgive me for not always aligning 
my priorities in accordance with Your will...Bless all who read 
this devotion with safety and good health...

Keep looking up, He knows our needs...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
