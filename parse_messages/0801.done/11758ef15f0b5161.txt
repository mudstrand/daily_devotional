Have a Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~True faith never gives us...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little yeast 
works through the whole batch of dough? (I Cor 5:6) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul was writing to those who were ignoring the churches problems.
They didn't realize that allowing open sin to exist in the church affects 
all the members...

Paul does not expect anyone to be sinless ~ all believers struggle
with sin daily. Instead, he is speaking against those who deliberately 
sin, feel no guilt, and refuse to repent...

This kind of sin cannot be tolerated in the church because it effects
others...

We have a responsibility to other believers. Blatant sins, left uncorrected, 
confuse and divide the congregation. While believers should encourage, 
pray for, and build one another up, they must also be intolerant of sin that
jeopardizes the spiritual health of the church...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that my actions would never cause
confusion or division in the church. Help me to always be faithful
and obedient in following Your will. Bless all who read this devotion.
Amen.

Keep looking up, He will lead you in paths of righteousness...
Your are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
