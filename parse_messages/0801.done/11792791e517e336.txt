BILLY GRAHAM'S SUIT. 


Something heartwarming - nice to see this kind of mail!



Billy Graham is now 86 years old with Parkinson's disease. 

In January 2000, leaders in Charlotte , North Carolina , 
invited their favorite son, Billy Graham, to a luncheon in 
his honor. 

Billy initially hesitated to accept the invitation because he 
struggles with Parkinson's disease. But the Charlotte 
leaders said, 'We don't expect a major address. Just 
come and let us honor you.' 
So he agreed. 

After wonderful things were said ab out him, Dr. Graham 
stepped to the rostrum, looked at the crowd, and said, 
'I'm reminded today of Albert Einstein, the great physicist who 
this month has been honored by Time magazine as the 
Man of the Century. Einstein was once traveling from 
Princeton on a train when the conductor came down the 
aisle, punching the tickets of every passenger. When he 
came to Einstein, Einstein reached in his vest pocket. He 
couldn't find his ticket, so he reached in his trouser pockets. 
It wasn't there, so he looked in his briefcase but couldn't find it. 
Then he looked in the seat beside him. 
He still couldn't find it. 


The conductor said, 'Dr. Einstein, I know who you are. 
We all know who you are. I'm sure you bought a ticket. 
Don't worry about it.' 

Einstein nodded appreciatively. The conductor continued 
down the aisle punching tickets. As he was ready to 
move to the next car, he turned around and saw the great 
physicist down on his hands and knees looking under his 
seat for his ticket. 

The conductor rushed back and said, 'Dr. Einstein, 
Dr. Einstein, don't worry, I know who you are. No problem. 
You don't need a ticket. I'm sure you bought one.' 

Einstein looked at him and said, 'Young man, I too, know who I am. 
What I don't know is where I'm going.'' 

Having said that Billy Graham continued, 
'See the suit I'm wearing? It's a brand new suit. 
My wife, my children, and my grandchildren are telling me 
I've gotten a little slovenly in my old age. I used to be a bit 
more fastidious. So I went out and bought a new suit for this 
luncheon and one more occasion. 

You know what that occasion is? This is the suit in which 
I'll be buried. But when you hear I'm dead, I don't want 
you to immediately remember the suit I'm wearing. 
I want you to remember this: 

I not only know who I am .. I also know where I'm going.' 



May your troubles be less, your blessings more, 
and may nothing but happiness, come through your door.
