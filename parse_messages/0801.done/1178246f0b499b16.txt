Have a Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~When we give ourselves to the Lord,
all other giving becomes much easier...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the Kingdom of God?
do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral nor Idolaters nor
adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders...

Nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers
will inherit the Kingdom of God...

And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were 
sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and 
by the Spirit of our God...(I Cor. 6:9-11) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Really Paul is describing the characteristics of unbelievers. But He doesn't 
mean that all those who have indulged in sexual sin or who have been idol 
worshipers, adulterers, male prostitutes, homosexuals, thieves, greedy people, 
drunkards, abusers, and swindlers are automatically and irrevocably excluded 
from heaven...

Christians come out of all different kinds of back grounds including these.
they may even still struggle with evil desires, but they should not continue 
in these practices...

In 6:11 Paul clearly states that even those who sin in these ways can have
their lives changed by Christ...

However, those who say that they are Christians but persist in these practices
with no sign of remorse will not inherit the Kingdom of God...

Such people need to reevaluate their lives to see if they truly believe in Christ...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I know without a doubt that I have sinned
and I pray again today for Your forgiveness ~ Instill within me a
clean heart Oh Lord. Bless those who will receive this devotion
and I commend all their family members into Your care and 
keeping...Amen.

Keep looking up, and receive His blessing...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
