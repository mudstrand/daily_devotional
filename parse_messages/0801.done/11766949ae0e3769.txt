Dear friends and prayer partners;
I just got this vital piece of information, and thought you all would be interested in its context:

Subject: Allah or the Lord Jesus Christ?

Allah or the Lord Jesus Christ?
This is very interesting and just a bit scary ...The Muslim religion is
The fastest growing religion per capita in the United States , especially
In the minority races!!!
Allah or The Lord Jesus Christ? ... By Rick Mathes
Last month I attended my annual training session that's required for
Maintaining my state prison security clearance. During the training
Session there was a presentation by three speakers representing the Roman
Catholic, Protestant and Muslim faiths, who explained each of their
Beliefs.
I was particularly interested in what the Islamic Imam had to say. The
Imam gave a great presentation of the basics of Islam, complete with a
Video. After the presentations, time was provided for questions and
Answers.

When it was my turn, I directed my question to the Imam and asked:
"Please, correct me if I'm wrong, but I understand that most Imams and
Clerics of Islam have declared a holy jihad [Holy war] against the
Infidels of the world and, that by killing an infidel, (which is a command
To all Muslims) they are assured of a place in heaven. If that's the
Case, can you give me the definition of an infidel?"

There was no disagreement with my statements and, without hesitation, he
Replied, "Non-believers! "
I responded, "So, let me make sure I have this straight. All followers of
Allah have been commanded to kill everyone who is not of your faith so
They can have a place in heaven. Is that correct?"

The expression on his face changed from one of authority and command to
That of "a little boy who had just been caught with his hand in the cookie
Jar." He sheepishly replied, "Yes."
I then stated, "Well, sir, I have a real problem trying to imagine Pope
John Paul commanding all Catholics to kill those of your faith or Dr.
Stanley ordering all Protestants to do the same in order to guarantee them
a place in heaven!"
The Imam was speechless!
I continued, "I also have a problem with being your 'friend' when you and
Your brother clerics are telling your followers to kill me! Let me ask
You a question. Would you rather have your Allah, who tells you to kill
Me in order for you to go to heaven, or my Jesus who tells me to love you
Because I am going to heaven and He wants you to be there with me?"
You could have heard a pin drop as the Imam hung his head in shame.
Needless to say, the organizers and/or promoters of the 'Diversification'
Training seminar were Not happy with Rick's way of dealing with the
Islamic Imam and exposing the truth about the Muslims' beliefs.
In twenty years there will be enough Muslim voters in the U.S. To elect
The President! I think everyone in the U.S. Should be required to read
This, but with the Liberal justice system, liberal media and the ACLU,
There is no way this will be widely publicized. Please pass this on to
All your e-mail contacts.

This is a true story and the author, Rick Mathes, is a well-known leader
In prison ministry.
The Man who walks with God always gets to his destination.


Thank you for taking the time to read this. Now you can either delete it
Or pass it on. No wishes, or promises or threats - just a choice.


God Bless you all.
