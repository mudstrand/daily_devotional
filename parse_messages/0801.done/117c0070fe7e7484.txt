Have a Blessed Day!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Christ Like love is patient with the faults of others...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Paul says, Nevertheless, each one should retain the place 
in life that the Lord assigned him and to which God has
called him. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches...
(I Cor. 7:17) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Apparently the Corinthians were ready to make wholesale changes without
thinking through the consequences. Paul was writing to say that people 
should be faithful Christian right where they are...

You can do God's work and demonstrate your faith anywhere. If you
became a Christian after marriage, and your spouse is not a believer,
remember you don't have to be married to a Christian to live for Christ...

Don't assume that you are in the wrong place or stuck with the wrong
person. You may be just where God wants you...(see vs. 20)

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to be in Your will ~ help me to
be faithful at all times. Help me to be more loveable in every
situation...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will show you what He wants from you...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
