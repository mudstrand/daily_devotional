This is Beautiful!!! 




If I don't get this back, I will know 
you really didn't read it. I got this 
from someone and thought the last 
part was really a good thought. 

Too bad that the person who sent 
it to me did not know 10 people 
who would admit to knowing the Lord.. 

Do You Love Him? 


This is a simple test: 

IF YOU LOVE JESUS, SEND 
THIS TO AT LEAST 10 PEOPLE, INCLU DING 
THE PERSON WHO SENT IT TO YOU! 

The Poem 
I knelt to pray but not for long, 
I had too much to do. 
I had to hurry and get to work 
For bills would soon be due. 
So I knelt and said a hurried prayer, 
And jumped up off my knees. 
My Christian duty was now done 
My soul could rest at ease..... 
All day long I had no time 
To spread a word of cheer 
No time to speak of Christ to friends, 
They'd laugh at me I'd fear. 
No time, no time, too much to do, 
That was my constant cry, 
No time to give to souls in need 
But at last the time, the time t o die. 
I went before the Lord, 
I came, I stood with downcast eyes. 
For in his hands God! Held a book; 
It was the book of life. 
God looked into his book and said 
"Your name I cannot find 
I once was going to write it down... 
But never found the time" 
Now do you have the time 
To pass it on? 

Joy 
I live in my own little world. 
But it's OK... They know me 
Here! 
If you look at what you do not have in life, you don't have anything, 
If you look at what you have in life, you have everything. 
Thomas Kinkade Paintings 
(hope the water is moving!!) 

Hope the water flows when you get the picture 

READ THE FIRST LINE CAREFULLY . . 
If God brings you to it, He will bring you through it. 
Happy moments, praise God. 
Difficult moments, seek God. 
Quiet moments, worship God. 
Painful moments, trust God. 
Every moment, thank God. 

This is a Thomas Kinkade painting It's rumored to carry a miracle! The water is supposed to be running, so if it's not moving then the picture 
Didn't come through entirely. 


They say if you pass this on, you will receive a miracle. 
I am passing this on because I thought it was really pretty, 
And who couldn't use a miracle?! 

"Flee the evil desires of youth, and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart" 

2 Timothy 2:22
