VERSE FOR TODAY:

_If you refuse to discipline your children, it proves you don't love
them; _

_If you love your children, you will promptly discipline them. _(Pro.
13:24)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

It is not easy for a loving parent to discipline a child, but it is
necessary.

The greatest responsibility God gives parents is the nurturing and
guidance

of their children. Lack of discipline puts parents love in question
because

it shows a lack of concern for the character development of their
children.

Disciplining children averts long range disaster. Without correction,
children

grow up with no clear understanding of right and wrong.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Heavenly Father, please remind us that we have been given a
great

blessing, but also a great responsibility in disciplining our
children. In

that responsibility our children will learn to become good parents. .
. Amen.
