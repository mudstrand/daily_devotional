VERSE FOR TODAY:

_The way of the godly leads to life; their path does not lead _

_to death. _(Pro. 12: 28)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

Needless to say that death for many is a darkened door at the

end of life, a passage way to an unknown destiny. But for God's

people, death is a bright pathway to a new and better life. So

friends why do we fear death? Is it fear of pain we expect, the

separation from loved ones, or the unknown? God can help us

with those fears. He has shown us that death is not final but just

another step in the eternal life we received when we follow Him.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Lord, I pray that we would always look at death as bright
pathway

to a better life, a life where there will be no more tears, suffering
or pain,

but a life of eternal bliss with You. . . Amen.
