VERSE FOR TODAY:

_Godliness help people all through life, while the evil are_

_destroyed by their wickedness. _(Pro. 13:6)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

Godly living safeguards your life. Every choice for good sets

into motion other opportunities for good. Evil choices follow

the same pattern, but in the opposite direction. Each decision

you make to obey God's Word will make a greater sense of

order to your life, while each decision to disobey will bring

confusion and destruction. The right choices you make reflect

your integrity. Obedience brings the greatest safeguard and

security.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Lord, I pray that I would always be obedient to Your

Holy Spirit's leading in my life. . . Amen.
