VERSE FOR TODAY:

_Mockers seek wisdom but never find it, but knowledge comes easily_

_to those with understanding. _(Pro. 14:6)

THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

We all know mockers, (people who seem to have nothing better to do

but ridicule people who have done a little bit better then
themselves.)

The reason they do not find wisdom is they do not seek it seriously.

Wisdom comes to those who apply God's Word to their lives and seek

out godly counselors. If the wisdom you seek does not come easily to

you perhaps your attitude is the barrier.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that my attitude would never become a

barrier in my ability to learn more about You. I pray that there
would

be an earnest effort in our country to draw closer to You. . . Amen.
