Today's Verses: Ps. 37:4-5

Take delight in the Lord, and He will give you your heart's desires. 
5 Commit everything you do to the Lord. Trust Him, and He will help you.

Today's Thoughts:

David calls us to "take delight in the Lord, and commit everything we have
and do to Him."

But how do we do this? To delight in someone means to experience great
pleasure and 

joy in his or her presence. This, can only happen when we know this person
well. So to 

delight in the Lord, we must know Him better. Knowledge of God's great love
for us will

indeed give us delight.



"To commit ourselves to the Lord," means entrusting everything-our lives,
families, jobs, 

possessions-to His control and guidance. To commit ourselves to the Lord
means to trust 

in Him, believing that He can care for us better than we can care for
ourselves. We should 

be willing to wait patiently for Him to work out what is best for us. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, Help me to remain faithful to a steady diet of Your Word 

so that I will get to know You as I should. . . Amen.

Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire,
called Conscience.
