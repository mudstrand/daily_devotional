Today's Verses: Ps. 34:20-22

For the Lord protects the bones of the righteous; not one of them is
broken! 
21 Calamity will surely overtake the wicked, and those who hate the
righteous will be punished.

22 But the Lord will redeem those who serve him. No one who takes refuge in
him will be condemned. 

Today's Thoughts:

This was a prophecy about Christ when He was crucified. Even though it was
the Roman custom to 

break the legs of the victim to speed dead, not one of Jesus' bones were
broken. The Psalmist says,

"Those who hate the righteous will be punished." What is meant here is those
who have cause pain 

to the Christian will one day find themselves, forsaken, wretched and alone.
As we should be aware 

"The Lord Has redeemed those who serve Him." The ransom was paid by Christ
on the cross.

What a tremendous promise we have here as chapter 34 comes to an end.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord so often we hear that Christians are being tormented and tortured
around the world, 

I thank You for the promise that one day the unrighteous will pay for their
crimes. As we 

have come to the close of another year I pray that Your Spirit would bless
each person who 

reads these devotions. I pray this in the name of Jesus. . . Amen.

I will thank the Lord because He is just;

I will sing praises to the name of the Lord Most High. Ps. 7:17
