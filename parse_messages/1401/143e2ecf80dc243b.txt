Today's Verses: Ps. 38:19-22

19 I have many aggressive enemies; they hate me without reason.

0 They repay me evil for good and oppose me for pursuing good.

21 Do not abandon me, O Lord. Do not stand at a distance, my God.

22 Come quickly to help me, O Lord my savior. 

Today's Thoughts:

People who are morally upright expose and shame those who aren't.

If we live for God the world will often hate us, because we make them 

painfully aware of their immoral way of living. We see a bit of fear in 

David which is not too difficult to understand, because his enemies were 

out to get him. Fear can turn into a dark shadow that will eventually 

envelope us and ultimately imprison us within ourselves. 

But we can conquer fear by using the bright liberating light of the Lord 

who brings salvation. If we want to dispel the darkness of fear, let us 

remember with the psalmist that "the Lord is my light and salvation." (Ps.
27:1)

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, forgive me, for complaining to anyone who will listen, while

I often praise You in private-Help me remember to complain in 

private and praise You publicly. I pray this in Jesus name, Amen.
