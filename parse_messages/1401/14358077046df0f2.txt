Today's Verses: Ps. 35:1-3

O Lord, oppose those who oppose me. Fight those who fight against me.

2 Put on your armor, and take up your shield. Prepare for battle, and come
to my aid.

3 Lift up your spear and javelin against those who pursue me. Let me hear
you say, "I

Will give you victory."

Today's Thoughts:

Cruelty may be far removed from some people's experience, but it is a daily
reality to others.

God promises to help the persecuted and to bring judgment on the unrepentant
sinners.

When our enemies are unjust and lie about us, even when we do good to them,
we can 

appeal to God who is always just. . . 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

I thank You Lord, for Your watchful eyes-and Your ears that are always open

To the cries of Your faithful. Cleanse me from all unrighteousness I pray in
Jesus

Name. . . Amen.
