Today's Verses: Ps. 38:17-18

I am on the verge of collapse, facing constant pain.

8 But I confess my sins; I am deeply sorry for what I have done. 

Today's Thoughts:

Sorrow for our sins can result in a changed behavior. The trouble is 

many people are sorry only for the results of their sins or for being 

caught ("sorrow without repentance").



Just compare Peter's remorse with Judas's bitterness and act of suicide.

Both denied Christ. One repented and was restored to faith and service; 

the other took his own life.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

I Thank You, Lord, that when we bring our sins to You in true repentance-

we will be restored-What a wonderful assurance of Your grace and mercy. . .
Amen.



Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

I will be gone a week or more so I will be away from the computer so-

There will be no Morning devo's for a week-stay warm-The Lord loves you! !
