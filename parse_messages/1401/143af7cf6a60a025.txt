Today's Verse: Ps. 38:1

1 O Lord, don't rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your rage! 

Today's Thoughts:

As a child may cry to his father, so David cried to God. David was not
saying,

"Don't punish me," but "Don't punish me while You are angry." What I see 

here is that he was acknowledging that he did deserved to be punished, but
he 

asked that God would temper His discipline with mercy. Like children, we are


free to ask for mercy, but we should not deny that we deserve punishment.

Today's Prayer suggestion:

Dear Lord, like David, I pray that You would temper my discipline with
mercy,

I have sinned and deserve to be disciplined but do it in mercy I pray in
Jesus name. . . Amen.
