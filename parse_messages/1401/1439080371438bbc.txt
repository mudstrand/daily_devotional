Today's Verse: Ps. 37:8-9

Stop being angry! Turn from your rage! Do not lose your temper- it only
leads to harm.

9 For the wicked will be destroyed, but those who trust in the Lord will
possess the land. 

Today's Thoughts:

Anger, rage, and envy are very destructive emotions.

They actually reveal a lack of faith that God loves us and is in control.

We should not worry, instead, we should trust in God giving ourselves 

to Him for His use and safekeeping. When you dwell on your problems, 

you will become anxious and worry. But if you concentrate on God and 

His goodness, you will find peace. Where have you focused your attention?

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, help me to always focus my attention on You, in Jesus name I pray. .
. Amen.
