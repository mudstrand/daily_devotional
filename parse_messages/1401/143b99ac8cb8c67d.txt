Today's Verses: Ps. 38:12-14

My enemies lay traps to kill me. Those who wish me harm make plans to ruin
me. 

All day long they plan their treachery. 
13 But I am deaf to all their threats. I am silent before them as one who
cannot speak.

14 I choose to hear nothing, and I make no reply. 

Today's Thoughts:

It is extremely difficult to remain silent when others tear us down, 

because we want to protect our reputation. We find it difficult to 

do nothing while they attack something so precious to us. But we 

do not have to lash out in revenge or justify our position, we can 

trust God to protect our reputation. 

Jesus was silent before His accusers (Lk. 23:9, 10).

He left His case in the God's hands (I Pet. 2:21-24).

That is a good place to leave our case too!

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, I thank You, that You are a forgiving God, and that I can come
confessing 

my sins with full confidence that You will forgive them all. And so I lay
them at Your 

feet knowing I have been forgiven. . . Amen.



Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our
sins.

(I Jn. 1:9)
