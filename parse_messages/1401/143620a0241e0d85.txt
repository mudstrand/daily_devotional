Today's Verses: Ps. 35:17-18

How long, O Lord, will you look on and do nothing? Rescue me from their
fierce attacks.

Protect my life from these lions!

18 Then I will thank you in front of the great assembly. I will praise you
before all the people. 

Today's Thoughts:

Evil is self-destructive, and it is never beyond God's control. God may use
whatever

instrument He chooses to control or punish us. But when we deserve
punishment or 

correction how can we complain about the kind of "rod" God uses on us? We
don't 

need to thank God for the trials in our life, but we should thank Him for
the lessons

He is trying to teach us. . . 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, I have much to learn, so I pray for passions to accept
the trials 

as a learning experience. . . Amen
