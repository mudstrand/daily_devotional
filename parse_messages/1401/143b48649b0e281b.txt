Today's Verses: Ps. 38:2-4

Your arrows have struck deep, and your blows are crushing me

3 Because of your anger, my whole body is sick; my health is broken because
of my sins

4 My guilt overwhelms me- it is a burden too heavy to bear. 

Today's Thoughts:

David saw his anguish as judgment for his sins-although God does not always
send 

physical illness to punish us for our sins-this verse and others in
Scripture indicate 

that He does in certain circumstances. Our sin can have physical or mental
side effects 

that can cause a great amount of suffering. Sometimes God has to punish His
children 

in order to bring them back to Himself.



When we repent of our sins God promises to forgive us. He will deliver us
from sins 

eternal consequences-but He does not promise to deliver us from all of sin's
earthly

consequences.



Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our
sins.

(I Jn. 1:9)
