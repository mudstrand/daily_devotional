Today's Verses: Ps. 36:11-12

Don't let the proud trample me or the wicked push me around.

12 Look! Those who do evil have fallen! They are thrown down, 

never to rise again. 

Today's Thoughts:

"The wicked" are people who try to make their own way in the world either 

as a law to themselves (Ps. 31:18) or by relying on false gods (Jer.
13:9-10).

" fallen-thrown down" Success and prosperity of the ungodly are fleeting.

This Psalm ends with the nature and ultimate destiny of wickedness.

God has already overthrown all evil and wickedness through His Son, our
Savior.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, I thank You that You defeated sin through the sacrifice of Your Son-

And that by faith in Him my sins are forgiven. I thank You for this even

though such love is beyond my comprehension. . .Amen.
