Today's Verses: Ps. 36:5-8

Your unfailing love, O Lord, is as vast as the heavens; your faithfulness
reaches beyond the clouds

6 Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, your justice like the
ocean depths. You care for people and animals alike, O Lord.

7 How precious is your unfailing love, O God! All humanity finds shelter in
the shadow of your wings.

8 You feed them from the abundance of your own house, letting them drink
from your river of delights. 

Today's Thoughts:

In contrast to evil people and their wicked plots that end in failure, God
is faithful, righteous, and just.

His love is as vast as the heavens-His faithfulness reaches beyond the
clouds-His righteousness is 

as solid as the mountains-and His judgments are as full of wisdom as the
oceans are with water.

We need not fear evil people because we know God loves us, judges evil, and
will care for us 

throughout eternity. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, I thank You for Your faithfulness, justice and love.

In spite of our fallen condition, You continue to pour out

Your love to all who know You. . . Amen.
