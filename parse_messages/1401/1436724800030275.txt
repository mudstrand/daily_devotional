Today's Verses: Ps. 35:21-23

They shout, "Aha! Aha! With our own eyes we saw him do it!" 
22 O Lord, you know all about this. Do not stay silent. Do not abandon me
now, O Lord.

23 Wake up! Rise to my defense! Take up my case, my God and my Lord. 

Today's Thoughts:

Have you ever cried out like David when you have been abused? I guess if we
are 

abused it is human nature to lash out in revenge or to give a detailed
defense of 

our every move. But as Christians we like David should ask God to fight our 

battles for us. He will clear our name in the eyes of those who really
matter.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, forgive me when I feel like I need to do or say something 

that would be better if it were left in Your hands. Give me patience 

when I hear things that irritate me, help me remember that I can 

always put my trust in You. . . Amen.
