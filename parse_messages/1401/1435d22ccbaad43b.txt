Today's Verse: Ps. 35:12-13

They repay me evil for good. I am sick with despair

Yet when they were ill, I grieved for them. I denied 

myself by fasting for them, but my prayers returned unanswered. 

Today's Thoughts:

In the previous verses of this chapter David prayed for God's intervention

but he was sad because he thought his prayers were going unanswered.

When our prayers are delayed, it is easy to assume that God has not
answered, 

but remember God hears our every prayer which He answers according to His
wisdom.

Don't let the absence of an immediate answer cause you to doubt or resent
God.

Instead, let it be an occasion to deepen your faith.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, I pray that you would deepen my faith in You so that when You choose


to delay the answers to my prayers I would not become doubtful, but remember


that You are faithful knowing what is best for me. . . Amen
