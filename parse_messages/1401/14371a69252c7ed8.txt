Today's Verses: Ps. 36:2-4 

The wicked arrogantly hunt down the poor. Let them be caught in the evil
they plan for others.

3 For they brag about their evil desires; they praise the greedy and curse
the Lord. 
4 The wicked are too proud to seek God. They seem to think that God is dead.


Today's Thoughts:

Some people succeed in everything they do, and they brag that no one 

not even God, can keep them down. We may wonder why God allows 

these people to gain great wealth while they despise Him as they do.

Bur why are we upset when the wicked prosper? Are we angry about 

the damage they are doing or just jealous of their success? To answer 

these questions we must gain the right perspective on wickedness and wealth.

The wicked will surely be punished because God hates their evil deeds.

We need to remember wealth is only temporary. It is not necessarily a 

sign of God's approval. Don't let wealth become your obsession.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, I beg two favors of You before I die. First, help me to never
tell a lie. Second, 

give me neither poverty nor riches! Give me just enough to satisfy my needs.
. . Amen.
