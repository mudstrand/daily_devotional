Today's Verses: Ps. 37:10-11

Soon the wicked will disappear. Though you look for them, they will be gone.

11 The lowly will possess the land and will live in peace and prosper.

Today's Thoughts:

Being gentle and lowly hardly seems like the type of character that can deal
with enemies.

God's warfare, however, must be carried out with calm faith, humility before
God, and 

hope in His deliverance-Jesus also promises a sure reward for those with
humble attitudes. (Mt. 5:5) 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, help me to always approach every situation when a 

gentle attitude. Bridle my tongue when I feel the urge to voice a

less than humble attitude. . . Amen.

Love your neighbor as yourself. Mt. 19:19



How seldom we weigh our neighbor in the same balance we weigh ourselves.

(Thomas a Kempis)
