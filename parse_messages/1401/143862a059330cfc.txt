Today's Verses: Ps. 37:1-3

1 Don't worry about the wicked or envy those who do wrong.

2 For like grass, they soon fade away. Like spring flowers, they soon
wither. 
3 Trust in the Lord and do good. Then you will live safely in the land and
prosper. 

Today's Thoughts:

We should never envy evil people, even though some maybe extremely popular 

or excessively rich. No matter how much they have, it will fade and vanish
like 

grass that withers and dies. Those who follow God live differently from the
wicked, 

and in the end, will have treasures in heaven. What an unbeliever gets on
earth may 

last a life time, but what you get from God lasts forever. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, I thank You, for the fact that You are the same yesterday today and
forever.

I thank You, that the promises You have made are the same from ever-lasting
to ever-lasting. . .Amen.
