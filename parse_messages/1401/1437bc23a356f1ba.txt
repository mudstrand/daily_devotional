Today's Verses: Ps. 36:9-10

For You are the fountain of life, the light by which we see. 
10 Pour out Your unfailing love on those who love You; give justice to those
with honest hearts. 

Today's Thoughts: "Fountain of Life" 

Is a vivid image of fresh, cleansing water that gives life to the
spiritually thirsty.

This same picture is used in Jeremiah 2:13, where God is called "Fountain of
living water."

Jesus spoke of Himself as living water that could quench thirst forever and
give eternal life

(John 4:14).

Why then should we deprive our souls? The living Word, Jesus Christ, and
the written

Word the Bible, which can satisfy our hungry and thirsty souls. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord we would not think of depriving our bodies of food and water 

when they hunger and thirst. So I pray that I would always seek the
nourishing 

spiritual food that comes to us through Your Word. . . Amen.
