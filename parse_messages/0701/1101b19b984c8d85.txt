GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Always put your best foot forward...

Our Meditation for Today:
Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those
who Moses led out of Egypt?

And with whom was He angry with for forty years? Was it not with
those who had sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert?

And with whom did God swear that they would never enter His
rest if not to those who disobeyed?

So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their 
unbelief...(Heb. 3:16-19) NIV

Our Thought for Today:
The important truths are that the people who failed to enter Canaan
were the people who had heard God's promise. They did not believe 
in God's protection...

They did not believe that God would help them conquer the giants in
the land...So God sent them into the wilderness to wander for 40 Years.

This was an unhappy alternative to the wonderful gift he had planned for
them...

Be ever mindful of the fact, that the lack of trust in God always prevents
us from receiving His best...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, thank You for all the wonderful promises
that we find in Your Word. By Your Holy Spirit's power I pray that
I would remain faithful, so that I might receive Your best...Amen.

Keep looking up, that you might receive His best...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
