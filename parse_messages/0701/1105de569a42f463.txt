GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Life is to short to waste time hating anyone.

Our Meditation for Today:

For the Word of God is living and active. Sharper than any 
double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and
spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes
of the heart. (Heb. 4:12) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

The Word of God is not simply a collection of words from God,
or a vehicle for communicating ideas; it is living, life-changing,
and dynamic as it works in us...

Like the keenness of a surgeon's knife, God's Word reveals who 
we are and what we are not. It penetrates the core of our moral and 
spiritual life...

It discerns what is in us, both good and evil. The demands of God's 
Word require decisions. We must not only listen to the Word; we
must also let it shape our life...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your Word for it is
a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path. I pray that
I would always allow it to speak to my heart, so that I may
not sin against you...Amen.

Keep looking up. with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
