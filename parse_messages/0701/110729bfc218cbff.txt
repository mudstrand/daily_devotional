GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~You don't have to win every argument. Agree to disagree...

Our Meditation for Today:

For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize
with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted
in every way, just as we are, yet was without sin...(Heb. 4:15) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Jesus is like us because He experienced a full range of temptations 
throughout His life as a human being...

We can be comforted in knowing that Jesus faced temptation, and so
He can sympathize with us. We can be encouraged knowing that Jesus 
faced temptation without giving in to sin...

He shows us that we do not have to sin when facing the seductive lure 
of temptation. Jesus is the only perfect human being who has ever lived.

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I am comforted by the fact that You do
sympathize with us when we fall into temptation. But I also realize
that this does not mean that You excuse us for doing it; so I pray
that You would forgive me of my sins of thought word and deed...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
