GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Do not divulge secrets...

Our Meditation for Today:

It still remains that some will enter that rest, and those who formerly
had the gospel preached to them did not go in, because of their
disobedience.

Therefore God again set a certain day, calling it Today, when a long
time later He spoke through David, as was said before: "Today, if
you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts." (Heb. 4:6, 7) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

God had given the Israelites the opportunity to enter Canaan, but they
disobeyed and fail to enter (Num. 13, 14)...

Now God offers us the opportunity to enter His ultimate place of rest.
He invites us to come to Christ...

To enter His rest, you must believe that God has this relationship in mind
for you; you must stop trying to create it; you must trust in Christ for it; and
you must determine to obey Him...

Today is the best time to find peace with God. Tomorrow may be to late...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, I thank you for the relationship You have planned for me
in Christ. I thank You for the true peace that is mine in You. The
world promises many things but fails to deliver, thus causing stress
for those who do not know You. So my prayer today is that they would 
come to a personal relationship with You that they may have true peace...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
