Subject: TAKE THE TIME TO RUN THROUGH THE RAIN


>A little girl had been shopping with her Mom in Target. She must have been 
>6 years old, this beautiful red haired, freckle faced image of innocence. 
>It was pouring outside. The kind of rain that gushes over the top of rain 
>gutters, so much in a hurry to hit the earth it has no time to flow down 
>the spout. We all stood there under the awning and just inside the door of 
>the Target.
>
> We waited, some patiently, others irritated because nature messed up their 
> hurried day. I am always mesmerized by rainfall. I got lost in the sound 
> and sight of the heavens washing away the dirt and dust of the world. 
> Memories of running, splashing so carefree as a child came pouring in as a 
> welcome reprieve from the worries of my day. The little voice was so sweet 
> as it broke the hypnotic trance we were all caught in, "Mom, let's run 
> through the rain," she said. "What?" Mom asked.
>
> "Let's run through the rain!" She repeated.
>
> "No, honey. We'll wait until it slows down a bit," Mom replied.
>
> This young child waited about another minute and repeated, "Mom, let's run 
> through the rain."
>
> "We'll get soaked if we do," Mom said.
>
> "No, we won't, Mom. That's not what you said this morning," the young girl 
> said as she tugged at her Mom's arm.
>
> "This morning? When did I say we could run through the rain and not get 
> wet?"
>
> "Don't you remember? When you were talking to Daddy about his cancer, you 
> said, 'If God can get us through this, he can get us through anything!'" 
> The entire crowd stopped dead silent. I swear you couldn't hear anything 
> but the rain. We all stood silently. No one came or left in the next few 
> minutes. Mom paused and thought for a moment about what she would say. Now 
> some would laugh it off and scold her for being silly. Some might even 
> ignore what was said. But this was a moment of affirmation in a young 
> child's life. A time when innocent trust can be nur tured so that it will 
> bloom into faith.
>
> "Honey, you are absolutely right. Let's run through the rain. If God let's 
> us get wet, well maybe we just needed washing," Mom said.
>
> Then off they ran. We all stood watching, smiling and laughing as they 
> darted past the cars and yes, through the puddles. They held their 
> shopping bags over their heads just in case. They got soaked. But they 
> were followed by a few who screamed and laughed like children all the way 
> to their cars.
>
> And yes, I did. I ran. I got wet. I needed washing. Circumstances or 
> people can take away your material possessions, they can take away your 
> money, and they can take away your health. But no one can ever take away 
> your precious memories... So, don't forget to make time and take 
> opportunities to make memories everyday. To everything there is a season 
> and a time to every purpose under heaven. I HOPE YOU STILL TAKE THE TIME 
> TO RUN THROUGH THE RAIN.
>
> They say it takes a minute to find a special person, an hour to appreciate 
> them, a day to love them , but then an entire life to forget them. Send 
> this to the people you'll never forget and remember to also send it to the 
> person who sent it to you. It's a short message to let them know that 
> you'll never forget them.
>
> If you don't send it to anyone, it means you're in a hurry.
>
> Take the time to live!!! Keep in touch with your friends, you never know 
> when you'll need each other -- and don't forget to run in the rain!
