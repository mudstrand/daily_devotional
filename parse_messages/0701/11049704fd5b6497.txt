GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Treat everyone you meet like you want to be treated...

Our Meditation for Today:

We also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did;
but the message they heard was of no value to them, because
those who heard did not combine it with faith...(Heb. 4:2) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

The Israelites of Moses' day illustrate a problem that is facing
many who fill our churches today. They know a great deal about
Christ, but many do not know Him personally...

They do not combine their knowledge with faith. We need to let 
the Good News about Christ benefit our lives. We need to believe
in Him then act on what we know. We need to trust in Christ and
then do what He says...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, as I learn more about You, I pray
that my faith would also grow. May I learn to trust You
more each day and grow in faithfulness...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
