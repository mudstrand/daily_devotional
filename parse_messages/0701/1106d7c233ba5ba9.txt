GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Pay off your credit cards every month...

Our Meditation for Today:

Therefore, since we have a great High Priest who has gone
through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly
to the faith we profess...(Heb. 4:14) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Christ is superior to the priests, and His priesthood is superior to
their priesthood. To the Jews, the high priest was the highest
religious authority in the land...

He alone entered the Holy of Holies in the temple once a year to 
make atonement for the sins of the whole nation as we see by (Lev. 16).

Like the high priest, Jesus mediates between God and us. As humanities
representative, He intercedes for us before God, As God's representative,
He assures us of God's forgiveness...

Jesus has more authority than the Jewish high priests because He is truly 
God and truly man. Unlike the high priest, who could only go before God
once a year, Christ is always at God's right hand, interceding for us...

He is always available to hear us when we pray...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your Son, our redeemer
and mediator, our representative. I thank you that You have
provided a High Priest who continually hears our prayers...
This morning I as that You would bless my friends with good
health and safety...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
