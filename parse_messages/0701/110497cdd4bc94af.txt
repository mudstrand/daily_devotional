COMING SOON! 


I am sorry but after hearing they want to sing the National Anthem in Spanish - enough is enough. Nowhere did they sing it in Italian, Polish, Irish (Celtic), German or any other language because of immigration. It was written by Francis Scott Key and should be sung word for word the way it was written The news broadcasts even gave the translation -- not even close. Sorry if this offends anyone but this is MY COUNTRY - IF IT IS YOUR COUNTRY SPEAK UP -- please pass this along. 
I am not against immigration -- just come through like everyone else. Get a sponsor; have a place to lay your head; have a job; pay your taxes, live by the rules AND LEARN THE LANGUAGE as all other immigrants have in the past -- and GOD BLESS AMERICA! 

PART OF THE PROBLEM 

Think about this: If you don't want to forward this for fear of offending someone -- YOU'RE PART OF THE PROBLEM !!!! The politically correctness police (i.e.. Holly weird and the media) have brainwashed you into thinking we should tolerate other peoples' disrespect to our nation, otherwise you are being racially prejudiced. That's BS of course.

It is Time for America to Speak up. If you agree -- pass this along; if you don't agree -- delete it!
