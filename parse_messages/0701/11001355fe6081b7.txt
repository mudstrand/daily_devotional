GOOD MORNING!!!~~~~~~(food for thought)~~~Live beneath your means...

Our Meditation for Today:
Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling,
fix your thoughts on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom 
we confess...

He was faithful to the One who appointed Him, just as Moses 
was faithful in all God's house...

Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, 
just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the 
house itself...(Heb. 3:1-3) NIV

Our Thought for Today:
To the Jewish people, Moses was a great hero; he had led their ancestors,
the Israelites, from Egyptian bondage to the border of the Promised Land.
He also had written the first five books of the Old Testament, and he was 
the prophet through whom God had given the Law. So it goes without saying
Moses was the greatest prophet in the Scriptures...

But Jesus is worthy of greater honor as the central figure of faith than Moses,
who was merely a human servant. Jesus is more than human; He is God Himself
(1:3). As Moses led the people of Israel out of Egyptian bondage, so Christ leads
us out of sin's slavery...

So the author of Hebrews asks, "Why settle for Moses, when you can have Jesus
Christ, who appointed Moses?"

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear heavenly Father, forgive me for ever putting anything or 
anyone else ahead of You. Help me to always be sensitive and
obedient to Your leading and guiding...Bless and keep my e-mail
friends safe this week. Help us each to put You first...Amen.

Keep looking up, if you believe you will achieve...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
