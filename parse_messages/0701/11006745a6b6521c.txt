GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Drive inexpensive cars, but own the best house you can afford.

Our Meditation for Today:
For every house is built by someone, but God
is the builder of everything...(Heb. 3:5) NIV

Our Thought for Today:
All of God's words are trustworthy and true. The Bible
is reliable because, unlike people, God does not lie,
forget, change His words, or leave His promises unfulfilled

We can trust the Bible because it contains the words of a 
holy, trustworthy, and unchangeable God...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, in an ever changing world it is
so reassuring that in You Your promises always remain
the same...I thank You that we have Your Word, the (Bible)
in which we can grow in a closer walk with You...Thank 
You Lord for Your love and mercy which are new every day...Amen.

Keep looking up, if you continue to believe you will achieve...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
