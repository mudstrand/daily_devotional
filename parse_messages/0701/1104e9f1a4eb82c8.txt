GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Life isn't always fair, but it's still good...

Our Meditation for Today:
Somewhere He has spoken about the seventh day in these words:
"And on the seventh day God rested from His work." (Heb. 4:4) NIV

Our Thought for Today:
Yes God did rest on the seventh day, but not because He was tired,
but to indicate the completion of creation. The world was perfect,
and God was well pleased with it...

This rest is a foretaste of our eternal joy when creation will be renewed
and restored, every mark of sin will be removed, and the world will be
made perfect again...

Our Sabbath-rest in Christ begins when we trust in Him to complete His
good and perfect work in us...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I long for the day when all sin will
be removed, and the world will be made perfect again...
I pray for a revival, and that it would begin with me...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
