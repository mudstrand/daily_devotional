GOOD MORNING!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~When in doubt, just take the next small step...

Our Meditation for Today:

For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later
about another day...

There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God:

for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, 
just as God did from His rest.

Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will
fall by following their example of disobedience...(Heb. 4:8-11) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

God wants us to enter His rest. For the Israelites of Moses' time, this rest 
was the earthly rest to be found in the Promised Land...

For Christians, it is peace with God now and eternal life on the new earth later.
We do not need to wait for the next life to enjoy God's rest and peace; we may
have it daily now!

Our daily rest in the Lord will not end with death but will become an eternal rest
in the place that Christ is preparing for us (Jn. 14:1-4).

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the Peace that is mine in You.
I thank You for the promise of eternal life in the place Christ has prepared.
I pray for peace and protection for our countries troops. I also pray for
protection for the innocent in Iraq...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
