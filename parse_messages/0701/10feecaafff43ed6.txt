GOOD MORNING!!!~~~~~~(food for thought)~~~Use the good silver...

Our Meditation for Today:
For surely it is not angels He helps, but Abraham's descendents...

For this reason He had to be made like His brothers in every way,
in order that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest
in service to God, and that He might make atonement for the sins 
of the people...(Heb. 2:16, 17) NIV

Our Thought for Today:
In the Old Testament, the high priest was the mediator between God 
and His people. His job was to regularly offer animal sacrifices according
to the law and to intercede with God for forgiveness for the people's sins.

Jesus Christ is now our high priest. He came to earth as a human being;
so, He understands our weaknesses and shows mercy to us...

He has once and for all paid the penalty for our sins by His own sacrificial 
death (atonement), and He can be depended on to restore our broken
relationship with God...

We are released from sin's domination over us when we commit ourselves 
fully to Christ, trusting completely in what He has done for us...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, You are our creator, comforter, and redeemer,
by You all things exist, by Your sacrifice the sins of all who trust in You
have received forgiveness of their sins...Once again I come to You asking
for forgiveness because I have sinned; I ask this in the name of Jesus...Amen.

Keep looking up, if you believe you will achieve...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
