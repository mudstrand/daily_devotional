Read Alone.....Especially the Poem





I believe whatever is in store for

us will be for us.

The poem is very true, unfortunately

Make sure you read the poem!



CASE 1: Kelly Sedey had one wish,

for her boyfriend of three years,

David Marsden, to propose to her.

Then one day when she was out

to lunch David proposed!

She accepted, but then had to leave

because she had a meeting in 20 min.

When she got to her office,

she noticed on her computer she had some e-mail's.

She checked it, the usual stuff

from her friends, but then she saw one

that she had never gotten before.

It was this poem. She simply deleted it

without even reading all of it.

BIG MISTAKE! Later that evening,

she received a phone call from the police

It was about DAVID! He had been in an accident

with an 18 wheeler. He didn't survive!



CASE 2: Take Katie Robinson She received this poem

and being the believer that she was

she sent it to a few of her friends but

didn't have enough e-mail addresses to send out

the full 5 that you must.

Three days later, Katie went to a masquerade ball.

Later that night when she left to get to her car,

she was killed in that spot by a

hit-and-run drunk driver.



CASE 3: Richard S. Willis sent this poem out

within 45 minutes of reading it.

Not even 4 hours later walking along the street

to his new job interview with a really big company,

when he ran into Cynthia Bell,

his secret love for 5 years. Cynthia came up to him

and told him of her passionate crush on him

that she had had for 2 years.

Three days later, he proposed to her and they got married.

Cynthia and Richard are still married

with three children, happy as ever!



This is the poem:



Around the corner I have a friend,

In this great city that has no end,

Yet the days go by and weeks rush on,

And before I know it, a year is gone.

And I never see my old friends face,

For life is a swift and terrible race,

He knows I like him just as well,

As in the days when I rang his bell

And he rang mine but we were younger then,

And now we are busy, tired men.

Tired of playing a foolish game,

Tired of trying to make a name.

"Tomorrow" I say! "I will call on Jim

Just to show that I'm thinking of him."

But tomorrow comes and tomorrow goes,

And distance between us grows and grows.

Around the corner, yet miles away,

"Here's a telegram sir," "Jim died today."

And that's what we get and deserve in the end.

Around the corner, a vanished friend.

Remember to always say what you mean

If you love someone, tell them.

Don't be afraid to express yourself.

Reach out and tell someone what they mean to you.

Because when you decide that it is the right time it might

be too late.

Seize the day. Never have regrets.

And most importantly, stay close to your friends

and family, for they have helped

make you the person that you are today.

You must send this on in 3 hours after reading the letter

to 10 other people.

If you do this, you will receive unbelievably good luck.

*NOTE*

the more people that you send this to, the better

luck you will have.

SMILE, even through your tears!!!!!
