> Senior citizens are constantly being criticized for every conceivable
> deficiency of the modern world, real or imaginary. We know we take
> responsibility for all we have done and do not blame others.
>
> HOWEVER, upon reflection, we would like to point out that it was NOT the
> senior citizens who took:
>
> The melody out of music, The pride out of appearance, The courtesy out of
> driving, The romance out of love, The commitment out of marriage, The
> responsibility out of parenthood, The togetherness out of the family, The
> learning out of education, The service out of patriotism, The Golden Rule
> from rulers, The nativity scene out of cities, The civility out of 
> behavior,
> The refinement out of language, The dedication out of employment, The
> prudence out of spending, The ambition out of achievement, or, God out of
> government and school.
>
> And we certainly are NOT the ones who eliminated patience and tolerance 
> from
> personal relationships and interactions with others!!
>
> And, we do understand the meaning of patriotism, and remember those who 
> have
> fought and died for our country.
>
> Does anyone under the age of 50 know the lyrics to O' Canada.
>
> Just look at the Seniors with tears in their eyes and pride in their 
> hearts
> as they stand at attention, on Remembrance Day and our Country's 
> birthday

>
> YES, I'M A SENIOR CITIZEN!
>
> I'm the life of the party...... even if it lasts until 8 p.m. I'm very
> good at opening childproof caps... with a hammer. I'm usually interested
> in going home before I get to where I am going. I'm awake many hours 
> before
> my body allows me to get up. I'm smiling all the time because I can't hear 
> a
> thing you're saying. I'm very good at telling stories; over and over and
> over and over... I'm aware that other people's grandchildren are not 
> nearly
> as cute as mine. I'm so cared for --- long term care, eye care, private 
> care
> dental care.

>
> I'm not really grouchy,
>
> I just don't like: traffic, waiting, crowds, lawyers, loud music, unruly
> kids, barking dogs, and a few other things I can't seem to remember right
> now.
>
> I'm sure everything I can't find is in a safe secure place, somewhere. 
> I'm
> wrinkled, saggy, lumpy, and that's just my left leg. I'm beginning to
> realize that aging is not for wimps. I'm sure they are making adults much
> younger these days, and when did they let kids become policemen? I'm
> wondering, if you're only as old as you feel, how could I be alive at 150?
> And, how can my kids be older than I feel sometimes?
>
> I'm a walking storeroom of facts..... I've just lost the key to the
> storeroom door.

> Now if I could only remember who sent this to me, I wouldn't send it back 
> to
> them, but I would send it to many more! Have an Awesome Day
