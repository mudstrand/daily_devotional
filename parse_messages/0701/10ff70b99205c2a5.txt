GOOD MORNING!!!~~~~~~(food for thought)~~~Be the first to say "Hello!"

Our Meditation for Today:
Because He Himself suffered when He was tempted, 
He is able to help those who are being tempted...(Heb. 2:18) NIV

Our Thought for Today:
Knowing that Christ suffered pain and faced temptation should
help us to face our trials...Jesus understands our struggles
because He faced them as a human being...

We can trust Christ to help us survive suffering and overcome 
temptation...So when you face trials, go to Jesus for strength 
and patience...He understands Your needs and is able to help.
(see Hebrews 4:14-16).

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your Love and mercy.
I thank You for Your understanding of the trials and temptations 
that I have to deal with. I pray for Your divine forgiveness, for all 
my sins...Bless and protect all my e-mail friends I pray in Jesus 
name...Amen.

Keep looking up, If you believe you will overcome...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
