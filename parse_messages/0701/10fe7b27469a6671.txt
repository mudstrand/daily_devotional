GOOD MORNING!!!~~~~~~(food for thought)~~~Say "please" a lot.

Our Meditation for Today:
Both the one who makes men holy and those who are made holy
are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them 
brothers...

He says, "I will declare your name to my brothers; in the presence 
of the congregation I will sing your praises.

And again, I will put my trust in him. and again he says "Here am I, 
and the children God has given me." (Heb. 2:11-13) NIV

Our Thought for Today:
We who have been set apart for God's service cleansed and made holy 
(sanctified) by Jesus now have the same Father as Jesus has, so He has 
made us His brothers and sisters...

Various psalms look forward to Christ and His work in the world . Here the 
writer has quoted a portion of Psalm 22, a messianic psalm...

Because God has adopted all believers as His children, Jesus calls them His 
brothers and sisters...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You that Jesus has made me, (a believer)
Your son. I pray for continued guidance by Your Holy Spirit, that I will
remain faithful all my days so that I would have a place prepared for me
in Your Heavenly Kingdom...Amen.

Keep looking up, for if you believe you will achieve...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
