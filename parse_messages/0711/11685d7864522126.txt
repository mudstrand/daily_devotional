Pastor, My daughter Elaine sent this to me. She received it from a friend in the military. Linda



Please read the following explanation before looking at the picture... 


This picture is not doctored. Most Syrians struggle to even read Arabic, much less have a clue about English 

So, how do a group of Syrian protest leaders create the most impact with their signs by having the standard "Death To Americans"(etc) slogans printed in English? 

Answer: They simply hire an English-speaking civilian to translate and write their statements into English. Unfortunately, in this case, they were unaware that the "civilian" insurance company employee hired for the job was a retired US Army sergeant! 



Obviously, pictures of this protest really never made their way through the Arab TV networks, but the results were "Priceless."
