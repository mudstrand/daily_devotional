Psalm 55:22 --- you really need to read this.
"Friends are God's way of taking care of us."
This was written by a Ã‚Â of Metro Denver Hospice Physician:

I was driving home from a meeting this evening about 5, stuck in traffic 
on Colorado Blvd., and the car started to choke and splutter and die - I 
barely managed to coast, cursing, into a gas station, glad only that I 
would not be blocking traffic and would have a somewhat warm spot to wait 
for the tow truck. It wouldn't even turn over. Before I could make the 
call, I saw a woman walking out of the "quickie mart" building, and it 
looked like she slipped on some ice and fell into a Gas pump, so I got out 
to see if she was okay.

When I got there, it looked more like she had been overcome by sobs than 
that she had fallen; she was a young woman who looked really haggard with 
dark circles under her eyes. She dropped something as I helped her up, and 
I picked it up to give it to her. It was a nickel.

At that moment, everything came into focus for me: the crying woman, the 
ancient Suburban crammed full of stuff with 3 kids in the back (1 in a car 
seat), and the gas pump reading $4.95.

I asked her if she was okay and if she needed help, and she just kept 
saying " don't want my kids to see me crying," so we stood on the other 
side of the pump from her car. She said she was driving to California and 
that things were very hard for her right now. So I asked, "And you were 
praying?" That made her back away from me a little, but I assured her I was 
not a crazy person and said, "He heard you, and He sent me."

I took out my card and swiped it through the card reader on the pump so 
she could fill up her car completely, and while it was fueling, walked to 
the next door McDonald's and bought 2 big bags of food, some gift 
certificates for more, and a big cup of coffee. She gave the food to the 
kids in the car, who attacked it like wolves, and we stood by the pump 
eating fries and talking a little.

She told me her name, and that she lived in Kansas City Her boyfriend left 
2 months ago and she had not been able to make ends meet. She knew she 
wouldn't have money to pay rent Jan 1, and finally in desperation had 
finally called her parents, with whom she had not spoken in about 5 years. 
They lived in California and said she could come live with them and try to 
get on her feet there.

So she packed up everything she owned in the car. She told the kids they 
were going to California for Christmas, but not that they were going to 
live there.

I gave her my gloves, a little hug and said a quick prayer with her for 
safety on the road. As I was walking over to my car, she said, "So, are 
you like an angel or something?"

This definitely made me cry. I said, "Sweetie, at this time of year angels 
are really busy, so sometimes God uses regular people."

It was so incredible to be a part of someone else's miracle. And of 
course, you guessed it, when I got in my car it started right away and got 
me home with no problem. I'll put it in the shop tomorrow to check, but I 
suspect the mechanic won't find anything wrong.

Sometimes the angels fly close enough to you that you can hear the flutter 
of their wings...

Psalms 55:22 "Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and He shall sustain thee. He 
shall never suffer the righteous to be moved." </SPAN></FONT></B><B><FONT

My instructions were to pick four people that I wanted God to bless, 
especially for the months inÃ‚Â 2007, and I picked you.

Please pass this to four people you want to be blessed and a copy back to 
me.


Here is the prayer:

"Father, I ask You to bless my children, grandchildren, friends, relatives 
and email buddies reading this right now. Show them a new revelation of 
your love and power. Holy Spirit, I ask You to minister to their spirit 
Ã‚Â this very moment. Where there is pain, give them Your peace and mercy. 
Where there is self doubt, release a renewed confidence through Your 
grace, In Jesus' precious name. Amen."

I know I picked more than four -- you can, too.
When Satan is knocking at your door, simply say, "Jesus, could You please 
get that for me
