FREE MARKET.......


Think About This One!!! It is short but very interesting!

A car company can move it's factories to Mexico and claim it's
a free market.

A toy company can outsource to a Chinese subcontractor and
claim it's a free market.

A shoe company can produce its shoes in Southeast Asia and
claim it's a free market.

A major bank can incorporate in Bermuda to avoid taxes and
claim it's a free market.

We can buy HP Printers made in Mexico. We can buy shirts made
in Bangladesh.

We can purchase almost anything we want from 20 different 
countries.

BUT, heaven help the senior citizens who dare to buy their 
prescription
drugs from a Canadian or Mexican pharmacy. That's called
un-American!

And you think the pharmaceutical companies don't have a 
powerful lobby?
Think again!


Forward this to every person you know over age 50. It is an 
interesting thought.

Maybe this is an issue that should come up in the next election!


Forget the 50 - send it to everyone. We're all in this boat 
together!

Even if you aren't in this boat now, you're standing on the 
pier.
