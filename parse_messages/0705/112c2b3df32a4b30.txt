HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~One can not inherit eternal life without repentance...

Our Meditation for Today:

Now we know that God's judgment against those who do
such things is based on truth...(Ro. 2:2) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Paul aims his words at the self-deception of supposing that one can
deceive God...

The Jews reassured themselves on the conclusion that they were children
of Abraham, God's covenant people. BUT they would not admit that they 
disregarded the will of God as revealed in the law...

There is a comparison that may be made similarly to nominal Christians
who follow outward practices of the church, though their lives indicate 
defiance of God's ways...

They hope to gain eternal life without repentance and the new birth which 
God offers...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I know that I have sinned against You,
so I pray that You would forgive me of my sins of thought,
word, and deed. I thank You for Your love and mercy. Watch
over my e-mail friends I pray in Jesus name...Amen.

Keep looking up, He's looking down...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
