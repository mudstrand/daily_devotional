HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Faith aglow is strengthening to others...

Our Meditation for Today:

I long to see you, that I may impart some spiritual gift to
strengthen you, that is, 

that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith,
both yours and mine...(Ro. 1:11, 12) 

Our Thought for Today:

As Paul, we should be hopeful that we can be used by God 
to assist others in further growth and nurture...

One glowing ember will fire a weaker one next to it...

The company of believers results in the infusing and 
infiltration of spiritual power among them...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the fellowship of 
other believers. I pray that I would be an encouragement
to those who are troubled. Help me to be a glowing ember...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
