~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A man and woman had been married for more than 60 years.They had shared 
everything. They had talked about everything. 
They had kept no secrets from each other except that the little old 
woman had a shoe box in the top of her closet that she had cautioned 
her husband never to open or ask her about. 

For all of these years, he had never thought about the box, but one day 
the little old woman got very sick and the doctor said she would not 
recover. 

In trying to sort out their affairs, the little old man took down the 
shoe box and took it to his wife's bedside. 

She agreed that it was time that he should know what was in the box. 
When he opened it, he found two crocheted dolls 
and a stack of money totaling $95,000. 

He asked her about the contents. "When we were to be married," she said, 
"my grandmother told me the secret of a happy marriage was to never 
argue. She told me that if I ever got angry with you, I should just keep quiet 
and crochet a doll." 

The little old man was so moved; he had to fight back tears. Only two 
precious dolls were in the box. She had only been angry with him two 
times in all those years of living and loving. He almost burst with happiness. 

"Honey," he said, "that explains the doll, but what about all of this 
money? Where did it come from?" 

"Oh," she said, "that's the money I made from selling the dolls." 


A Prayer....... 

Dear Lord, I pray for Wisdom to understand my man; Love to forgive him; 
And Patience for his moods; Because Lord, if I pray for Strength, I'll 
beat him to death because I don't know how to crochet.
