HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Luther, "Grace and peace comprehend the whole Christian life."

Our Meditation for Today:

Dear friends in Rome. God loves you dearly, and He has called you
to be His very own people. May grace and peace be yours from God 
our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ...(Ro. 1:7) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

All who are in Christ are entitled saints of God. There is no
exception. There is no middle class...

despite all degrees of sin among humans there are simply 
two classes in relation to God, namely, Christians and non-
Christians, saints or sinners...

Saintliness is the acceptance of Christ's merit and worthiness.
It is being made the partaker of an inheritance otherwise not 
one's own...

It is a gift of divine grace because even the most mature saints
are not sinless and holy in themselves...

Paul's greeting, "May grace and peace be yours from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ." has two directives...

"Grace" relates to the forgiveness of sins; "Peace" relates to a 
conscience free from unrest...

When we have learned that no evil can befall us without the Father's 
knowledge, and that He wills only blessing for the believer, then
there can be true peace of mind and heart...

Our Lord spoke of this when He said, "Peace I leave with you; My
peace I give to you" (Jn. 14:27)...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, I thank You for the assurance of the forgiveness
of my sins, and the peace of mind that come with the forgiveness
of my sins...I thank You too for the knowledge that no evil can
come upon me with out your knowledge of it...

Bless and protect my e-mail friends today...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
