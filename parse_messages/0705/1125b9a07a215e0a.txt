HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Don't wait for six strong men to take you to church...

Our Meditation for Today:

Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart
for the gospel of God, 

Which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures, 

The gospel concerning His Son, who was descended from David according 
to the flesh 

And designated Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by His 
resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord...(Ro. 1:1-4) 

Our Thought for Today:

Paul is quiet bold in his declaration of the greatness and certainty
of his message. He claims a commission from God to deliver a
message, "the gospel concerning His Son."

Paul's emphases is that God sent His Son into the world to redeem
mankind otherwise lost because of sin...

Matthew also declared this in reviewing the genealogy of Jesus in 
(Mt 1:1-17).

It is also John's premise when he declared that Jesus, the Word
"became flesh and dwelt among us" Jn. 1:14).

Is this difficult for you to believe?

YES! Christ became incarnate to redeem those who would 
believe in Him...

Because of this there are million both in this life and in eternity
who raise their songs in praise to His saving grace...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You and praise You for
Christ's redeeming power. I thank You for the promise 
of eternal life where there will be no more suffering or
death. Where we will live eternally...Amen.

Keep looking up, toward the SON...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
