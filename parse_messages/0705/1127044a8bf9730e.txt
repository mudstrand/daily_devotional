HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~We are all beloved of God through Jesus Christ the Savior...


Our Meditation for Today:

I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all or you,
because your faith is proclaimed in all the world...(Ro. 1:8) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

We can rejoice knowing that people are seeking Christ even though
they are not free from faults. Children within a home are heirs at their 
birth. They are given parental love though there are differences in their
ages, development, and personality...

This is also true of the family of God. we are all beloved of God through 
Jesus Christ the Savior...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, I pray that my faith would be a witness of my love
for You. I pray for Your guidance that my faith would always 
shine for You. Forgive me for all the times I have fallen short 
of the mark...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
