HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Judge not lest ye be judged~~~

Our Meditation for Today:

So when you, a mere man, pass judgment on them and 
yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God's
judgment? (Ro. 2:3) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Paul's reference here is intended to show that judging others
cannot avert being judged... Rather, the wrong is magnified 
when judgment is made against sin that is practiced by the 
one who judges...

Now the favor of God had been directed toward the Jews,
and they had experienced much grace, so their judgment 
would be much more formidable...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, this country has been blessed in so many ways
by Your favor. Each of us have much to be thankful for yet
we point fingers at the sins of other nations for their sins,
sins of which we too are guilty of. Forgive us Lord for our
short-sidedness, I would pray that a revival would begin in
this country...Amen.

Keep looking up and pray for a revival too...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
