HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~The task ahead of us is never as great 
as the power behind us...

Our Meditation for Today:

Because of this, God gave them over to their shameful lusts.
Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural
ones.

In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations
with women and were inflamed with lusts for one another.
Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received 
in themselves the due penalty for their perversion...(Heb. 1:26, 27) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

When people dishonor God, reducing His image to that of man 
or animals, they sink lower than beasts. They practice iniquity 
lower than what might be considered that of animals...

Not only are the coarse and grossly evil persons guilty of these
sins, but learned ones and cultured people also have fallen in 
similar ways...

When such filthy practices make slaves of the educated and the 
cultured it is evident that the avenger is near...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, There is much need for repentance 
in the world today. It is just as You predicted it would be
many have given themselves over to the lust of the flesh.
I pray that there would be a cleansing in the world and that
these people would turn once again to righteousness...Amen.

Keep looking up, for the cleansing power...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
