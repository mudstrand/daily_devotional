"If you have integrity, nothing else matters.
If you don't have integrity, nothing else matters" - Alan K. Simpson


Subject: Living Bible


Now this is the Living Bible:

His name is Bill. He has wild hair, wears a T-shirt with holes in it,
jeans, and no shoes. This was literally his wardrobe for his entire four
years of college.

He is brilliant. Kind of profound and very, very bright.
He became a Christian while attending college.

Across the street from the campus is a well-dressed,
very conservative church.

They wanted to develop a ministry to the students but were not sure
how to go about it.

One day Bill decides to go there. He walks in with no shoes, jeans, his
T-shirt, and wild hair.

The service has already started and so Bill starts down the aisle looking 
for a seat.

The church is completely packed and he can't find a seat. By now, people
are really looking a bit uncomfortable, but no one says anything.

Bill gets closer and closer and closer to the pulpit, and when he
realizes there are no seats, he just squats down right on the carpet.

By now the people are really uptight, and the tension in the air is thick.

About this time, the minister realizes that from way at the back of the
church, a deacon is slowly making his way toward Bill.

Now the deacon is in his eighties, has silver-gray hair, and a
three-piece suit. A godly man, very elegant, very dignified, very
courtly.

He walks with a cane and, as he starts walking toward this boy,
everyone is saying to themselves that you can't blame him for what he's
going to do.

How can you expect a man of his age and of his background to understand
some college kid on the floor?

It takes a long time for the man to reach the boy.

The church is utterly silent except for the clicking of the man's cane.

All eyes are focused on him. You can't even hear anyone breathing.

The minister can't even preach the sermon until the deacon does what he has
to do.

And now they see this elderly man drop his cane on the floor. With great
difficulty, he lowers himself and sits down next to Bill and worships
with him so he won't be alone.

Everyone becomes chokes up with emotion.

When the minister gains control, he says, "What I'm about to preach, you
will never remember. What you have just seen, you will never forget. "

"Be careful how you live. You may be the only Bible some people will
ever read!"

I asked the Lord to bless you
As I prayed for you today.
To guide you and protect you
As you go along your way....
His love is always with you,
His promises are true,
And when we give Him all our cares,
You know He will see us through.

Only if you feel to, pass this to People you
want God to Bless....I DID!
