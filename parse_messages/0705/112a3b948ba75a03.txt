HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~The sin of pride is in essence rebellion against God...

Our Meditation for Today:

Although they claim to be wise, they became fools and exchanged
the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal
man and birds and animals and reptiles...(Ro. 1:22, 23) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Through the ages the sin of pride has been unpleasing to God.
Very often the most judicious minds and the most learned
philosophers have fallen into gross foolishness when they have
cast aside the fear of God in their claim to be wise...

They have made fools of themselves, substituting all manner of
idolatry in an effort to satisfy their religious hunger...

One needs to be careful not to fall into the sin of pride, because 
more often than not that person will also casts aside God for some 
material object...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that my focus would always be
on You. May my worship always be on You the creator and 
not on the created. I pray that my spiritual hunger would be
on You O Lord...Amen.

Keep looking up, then you are sure to be focused on Him...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
