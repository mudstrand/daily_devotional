HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~ (food for thought)~~~Don't put a question mark where God has put a period...

Our Meditation for Today:

Greet all your leaders and all God's people. Those from Italy
send you their greetings...

Grace be with you all...(Heb. 13:24, 25)

Our Thought for Today:

The book of Hebrew has been a call to Christian maturity.
It was addressed to first-century Jewish Christians, but it
applies to Christians of any age or background...

Christian maturity means making Christ the beginning and 
the end of our faith. To grow in maturity we must center our
life on Him, 

not depending on religious ritual,
not falling back into sin,
not trusting in ourselves,
and not letting anything come between
us and Christ...

Christ is sufficient and superior...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, what a wonderful thought that comes to mind
when I think about the Savior, He is the beginning and the 
end. What a difference when comparing this world where
all we have here is temporary...I thank you for this relationship.
Mt. 6:19-21 is so true, "Don't store up your treasures here;
store them in heaven...Amen.

This is the last devotional from Hebrews I will now start
with the book of Romans...

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
