HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~There are many, who follow their own desires,
disregarding God's Word and His will...

Our Meditation for Today:

For although they knew God, they neither glorified Him as God,
nor give thanks to Him, but their thinking became futile and their 
foolish hearts were darkened... (Ro. 1:21) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

God has given us the true Gospel. He has bestowed His grace 
upon us. He has placed before us the wonders of creation test-
ifying to His majesty...

He has given us His Son to become our brother, mediator, and 
redeemer. He met every demand of the law, and offered His blood
to redeem us from sin and the curse...

He has given us His Word, telling us all about it. Day by day He 
sends His Holy Spirit to nurture the life of godliness within us...

But there are many who still follow their own desires, disregarding 
God's Word and His will. But God will deal with them according to
the words of this text...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, I thank You for Your Word which makes it clear 
what Your will is for man-kind. I pray that those who seek
their own desires would come to the knowledge of the truth
and seek Your will for their lives...Amen.

Keep looking up, and follow His will...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
