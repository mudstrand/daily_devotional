HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~God grades on the cross, not the curve...

Our Meditation for Today:

For in a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness 
that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: "The righteous
will live by faith...(Ro. 1:17) NIV...

Our Thought for Today:

What is being said is: the righteousness of God is made known through
the Gospel. What a revelation this is!

It is this, that Christ's merit is imputed to believers. It is a right given to
believers, and it is the only righteousness that will stand valid before God.

This plan was conceived in the mind of God in order to provide a way of
righteousness for persons who would claim it, through members of a fallen
race...

This way of righteousness has been wrought for us through Jesus Christ.
It is appropriated by faith, and by it a sinner is acquitted from all guilt...

When a person accepts this righteousness offered by the Lord his name
is entered into the book of life and he becomes an heir to eternal life...

Our Prayer for Today:
I thank You Lord for the Gospel and the truth which is
revealed in it. I thank You for providing a way for each
believer to inherit eternal life...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
