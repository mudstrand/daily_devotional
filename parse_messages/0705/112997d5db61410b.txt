HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~You can tell how big a person is, 
by what it takes to discourage him...

Our Meditation for Today:

Since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities, His eternal
power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood
from what has been made, so that men are without excuse...(Ro. 1:20) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

What Paul is saying is that even the Gentiles possess a degree of knowledge
that makes them responsible before God...

The evidences and wonders of creation are so clear that even the non-Christian
world can see God's power. This evidence is all the more impressive in contrast
with the "ungodliness and the wickedness of men."

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear heavenly Father, it is sad how some people try so frantically 
to explain away the creation of the word and all that is in it and even
the existence of the human race. I thank You Lord for Your wisdom 
in creating all things, and Your sustaining power...Amen.

Keep looking up, and give thanks for His sustaining power...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
