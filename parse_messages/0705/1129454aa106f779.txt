HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Don't give God instructions, just report for duty...

Our Meditation for Today:

The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against
all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress
the truth by their wickedness...(Ro. 1:18) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

These words tell of impending judgement awaiting those who do not
possess the righteousness that God provided through His Son, Jesus
Christ...

The need for the Gospel is made clear because we are informed of the
need that is ours...

Unless we have Christ we have the wrath of God hovering over us...

This warning is made very clear in vs. 5 of chapter 2: "By your hard and
impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath
when God's righteous Judgement will be revealed."

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You again that the Gospel warns me
of my need for repentance. So, I ask that You would forgive me of my
sins of thought, word and deed. I thank You for the finished work of
Christ on the cross...Amen.

Keep looking up with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
