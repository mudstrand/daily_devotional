HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Without Christ there is no grace...

Our Meditation for Today:

Through Christ, God has given us the privilege and authority
to tell Gentiles everywhere what God has done for them, so
that they will believe and obey Him, bringing glory to His name.
(Ro. 1:5) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

We need to remember, that as Christians we have a privilege
and a great responsibility...

Paul and the apostles received the privilege of being called,
but they also received the authority and the responsibility to
share with others what God has done...

God also graciously forgives our sins when we believe in Him
as Lord. In doing this, we are committing ourselves to begin 
a new life...

Paul's new life also involved a God-given responsibility: to
witness about God's Good News to the world as a missionary.

God may or may not call you to be a foreign missionary, but
He does call you (and all believers) to be Christ's ambassador
and to witness to the changed life that Jesus Christ has begun
in you...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Lord, because of Your name being glorified let Your
mercy abound in me, to save me however unworthy I am.
Sanctify me in Your Word for Your Word is true...Amen.

Keep looking up, with an attitude of gratitude...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
