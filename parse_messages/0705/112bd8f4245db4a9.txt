HAVE A NICE DAY!!!~~~(food for thought)~~~Judge not for all are guilty before God

Our Meditation for Today:

You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgement
on someone else, for at whatever point you judge the other, 
you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment
do the same things...(Ro 2:1) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

The Jews held a favored position as God's chosen people.
they had been given the divine law, and knowledge of the true
God had been revealed to them...

Because of this they were inclined to judge others who did not
possess the knowledge they did...

Paul warns against this human tendency to judge, it is an
inclination that it often used as an attempt to defend oneself
and to build personal security...

But we need to remember, that we are all guilty before God.

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear heavenly Father help us one and all to remember
that as we point a finger at someone else, there are three
fingers pointing back at us. Forgive me for being judgmental,
help me to see my own faults first...
Bless and protect my e-mail friends...Amen.

Keep looking up, for all things come from God...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
