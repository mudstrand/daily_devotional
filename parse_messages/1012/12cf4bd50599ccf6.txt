Just 27 Words: 

God our Father, walk through my house and take away all my worries
and illnesses and please watch over and heal my family in Jesus'
name. Amen. 

His prayer is so powerful. Pass this to 12 people including me. 

Do not break or ask questions. This is a test. Does God come first in
your life? If so, stop what you're doing & send it to 12 people now.
Watch what He does!
