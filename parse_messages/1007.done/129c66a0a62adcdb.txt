07/13/2010~~~food for thought~~~REPELLENT FOR SIN

Our Bible Verse for Today:
I have hidden Your Word in my heart, that I might not sin against You.
Ps. 119:11

Our Lesson for Today:
During the summer months I have trouble finding enough repellent to keep the
Minnesota mosquitoes at bay. Every time I leave the house without a liberal amount
of mosquitoes spray all I get done is swatting them...

This reminds me of beginning the day without a liberal amount of God's Word. 
It is the only thing that will help us keep the sins of the world at bay. When I spray
a liberal amount of God's Word on my soul, sin can't bite quite as much. I do however,
need to apply God's Word regularly if I want protection. That's why the psalmist wrote,
"I have hidden Your Word in my heart that I might not sin against you."

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, cover me with Jesus' pardon when sin bites
and with His power when sin buzzes near...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
