07/17/2010 ~~~ food for thought ~~~ DON'T PUT GOD OFF

Our Bible Verse for Today:
I tell you ~ now is the time of God's favor ~ now is the day of salvation.
(II Cor. 6:2)

Our Lesson for Today:
O how patient God is!!! ~ He wants me to look forward to heaven's shores 
where I can see Jesus. Every day that I open my eyes is a time of His favor ~ 
His grace ~ another day He grants me so that I might seek His salvation... ~

But God's patients has a limit. ~ How many more days does He have for me?
How much more time for me to learn of my Savior? ~ We need to remember
that He who gives life also measures life... ~

When He says that ~ it's time, He means ~ my life will end and with it my 
opportunity to seek His salvation. ~ If we dilly, dally along, we will have to
face eternity without the Savior Jesus and with no one to blame but ourselves...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, don't leave me to myself or else I will only waste
the opportunity You have given me. Open my heart to the news 
of Your Savior. Give me the hand of faith to hold Him as my
treasure...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
