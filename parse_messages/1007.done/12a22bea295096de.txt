07/30/2010~~~food for thought~~~WHY DID SHE WEEP?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
She began to wet His feet with her tears... Jesus said to her,
"Your sins are forgiven...Your faith has saved you, go in peace."
(Lk. 7:38, 48, 50)

Our Lesson for Today:
Why was the woman in our verse crying? When we hurt people we love, 
sorrow and tears often come. That woman's life was riddled with sins.
How many and what kind, we can only guess...

At her Savior's feet she cried because she realized that every one of them 
was ultimately something done to Him [Jesus]. Repentance brought the tears
with which she wet Jesus' feet...

So did gratitude. She was crying not only because of what her sins had done 
to Jesus but also because of what Jesus had done to her sins. From Her 
Savior she heard it again. "Your sins are forgiven," He assured her. They're
gone no matter what they are. Your faith has saved you," He continued. It's
My gift to you so that you can lay hold on Me. "Go on peace," He concluded ~
this is wonderful peace that only the forgiven sinner can appreciate...

When we truly realize what our sins have done to Jesus and what Jesus has 
done to our sins, tears will come to our heart if not also to our eyes...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, tears are in order when I see how my sins have hurt You
and how Your love has forgiven me...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
