Our Bible Verse for Today:
He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only ours but also
for the sins of the whole world. (I Jn. 2:2)

Our Lesson for Today:
The cross of Jesus fits every sinner. The love He showed on the cross
covers everyone. The suffering in the depths of hell paid for every sin.
He died on that cross in the place of every sinner, from the first Adam
in the garden to the last Adam when the world ends...

When Jesus rose on the third day, He showed His payment for sin was
sufficient to cover the whole world. "The atoning sacrifice," John described 
Him, a sacrifice that is sufficient to cover, "Not only for our sins but also 
for the sins of the whole world."

There can be no doubt. Jesus' cross fits all. ~ it fits me. The Savior was 
tailor-made for me. ~~~ Jesus' cross assure me!

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me each day to raise my eyes to Your cross. 
Remind me that Your sacrifice covers every sinner...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
