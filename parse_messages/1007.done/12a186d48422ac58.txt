Our Bible Verses for Today: (These are verses which were sent to me by my cousin as homework)
We should be decent and pure in everything we do, so that everyone can approve 
of your behavior. Don't participate in wild parties and getting drunk, or in adultery 
and impure living, or in fighting and jealousy. ~ But let the Lord Jesus Christ take
control of you, and don't think of ways to indulge your evil desires...(Ro. 13:13-14)

Our Lesson for Today: (What I have gleaned from these verses)
I'm sure there are those who disagree with Paul when he lists fighting and jealousy with
gross and obvious sins of drunkenness and immorality. ~ If you will notice in Paul's 
writings he considers attitudes as important as actions...

Just as hatred leads to murder, so jealousy leads to strife and lust to adultery. When 
Christ returns, He wants to find His people clean on the inside as well as on the outside,

In vs. 14 We are told to 'Let the Lord Jesus Christ take control of us.' How do we do this?
(first) we identify with Christ by being baptized (Gal. 3:27). This shows our solidarity
with other Christians and with the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

(second) We are to exemplify the qualities Jesus showed while He was here on earth 
(love, humility, truth, service). In a sense we role-play what Jesus would do in our situation.
(see Eph. 4:24-32; Col. 3:10-17)...Yes we should avoid those situations that open the door 
to gratifying sinful desires.

LIFE IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT. 
It has always been ~ It will always be.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to be sensitive to Your Holy Spirit's
leading and guiding, so that I might exemplify the qualities
You lived while on earth...Amen.

No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
