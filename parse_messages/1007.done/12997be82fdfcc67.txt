07/03/2010~~~food for thought~~~WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR SINS?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
[You] hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea. (Micah 7:19)

Our Lesson for Today:
"They are all gone," the psalmist tells me. "God has hurled them into the
depths of the sea."

Jesus came to wrap all those sins into one gigantic ball, load it on the barge
of His love, and dump it into the deepest part of the ocean. What a picture!

God has paid for my sins with the blood of His Son. He's put them totally out
of sight as if they never happened. Where do they go? Into the depths of the sea,
where God no longer sees them and where He places the sign. "No fishing allowed,'
that means I am to leave them alone too...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, remind me daily how you have totally
removed my sins through Jesus' blood...Amen. 
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
