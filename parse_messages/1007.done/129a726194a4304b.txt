07/06/2010~~~food for thought~~~REGULAR COMMUNICATION...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Listen to my voice each morning, Lord. Each morning I bring
my requests to You and I wait expectantly...(Ps. 5:3))

Our Lesson for Today:
The secret to a close relationship with God is to pray to Him earnestly each morning. 
In the morning, our minds are more free from problems, and then we can commit the 
whole day to God... 

Regular communication helps any friendship and is certainly necessary for a strong 
relationship with God. ~ We need to communicate with Him daily. Do you have a regular
time to pray and read God's Word???

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, Help me to remember to communicate
with You regularly...Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
