07/14/2010~~~food for thought~~~A HOME THAT IS PERMANENT

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building
from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands. (2 Cor. 5:1)

Our Lesson for Today:
Here we see that Paul compares our existence in the world to tenting. The world
in which we live will not be here forever, nor will the bodies in which we walk through it.

I believe that far to many people value their earthly existence as permanent. They
build for themselves structures as if they were going to be here forever. AND
when the time comes as it always does, for the tent stakes of this life to be pulled
up, they become frantic. What the thought to be permanent was only temporary. 
And so they have no home to go to but hell...

Waiting for me is an eternal house in heaven. ~ God Himself has built it, and that truth
makes it certain. So does the material He used in building it. The blood of His beloved Son,
His perfect payment for all my sins, and His complete keeping of all God's commandments
are the concrete and lumber for my eternal home. That house will stand forever.

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me remain focused on Your permanent heaven
and help me to remain faithful on my way home...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
