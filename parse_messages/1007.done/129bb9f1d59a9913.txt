Our Bible Verse for Today:
All of us have strayed away like sheep. We have left God's paths to follow our own.
Yet the Lord laid on Him the guilt and sins of us all...(Isa. 53:6)

Our Lesson for Today:
Isaiah speaks of Israel straying from God and compares them to wandering sheep.
Yet God would send the Messiah to bring them back into the fold...

Think about it ~ we have the hindsight to see and know the identity of the promised
Messiah, who has come and died for our sins. ~ But if we know all that Jesus did
and still reject Him, our sin is much greater than that of the ancient Israelites, who
could not see what we have seen...

Have you given your life to Jesus, the "Good Shepherd," (Jn. 10:11-16) or are you 
still like a wandering sheep?

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, thank you that I, a wandering sheep, can say,
"The Savior died for me..." Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
