07/16/2010~~~food for thought~~~CHRIST'S CROSS = GOD'S LOVE =
MY SALVATION

Our Bible verse for Today:
May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
(Gal. 6:14)

Our Lesson for Today:
Have you ever noticed how often the Bible connects God's love with the cross?
John 3:16 speaks of a God who so loved that He gave His one and only Son, a
giving that led to the cross...

Another well-known 3:16 says it too, "This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ
laid down His life for us" (I John).

What kind of love is this? A love that seeks to repay family or gain favor from friends I 
can understand. BUT a love that gives the ultimate for enemies, a love that repays hatred
and hostility with pardon and peace, how can we describe it? What can we do but marvel 
at it?

Christ's cross = God's love = my salvation. So simple and so awesome!
And so worthy of our praise...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, keep Your cross my trust and joy till in heaven
I can praise You fully for Your Lore...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
