07/02/2010~~~food for thought~~~WHAT IF GOD COUNTED?

Our Bible Verses for Today:
If You, O Lord, kept a record of sins, O Lord, who could stand?
But with You there is forgiveness; therefore You are feared.
(Ps. 130:3, 4)

Our Lesson for Today:
What if, each day God kept track one by one of our filthy thoughts, biting words,
and unkind actions? How often do we go through the day without realizing how
often we have sinned?

If we could see a bowl overflowing with our wrongs, we would have to say like 
the psalmist, "How can I stand before You, O Lord? I'm lost!"

But the psalmist goes on with words we need to hear. "With You There is 
forgiveness." ~ Yes God sent His own Son to empty the bowl of our sins.
Thank God, He credits Jesus' payment to us instead of recording our sins 
against us...

Prayer Suggestion:
Thank you, Lord, for wiping my record clean through Jesus'
payment for all my sins...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
