Please forgive me but this will be the last Devotion until next week
as I will be busy in Moorhead moving my daughter's belongings to 
her new place...

07/24/2010~~~food for thought~~~ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

Our Bible Verse for Today:
For God so love the world that He gave His one and only Son,
That whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal
life...(Jn. 3:16)

Our Lesson for Today:
Satan's most effective weapon is whispering in the sinner's ear,
"You need to do something for your salvation." ~ "It's to easy,"
Satan says when the sinner hears that all he has to do is believe
in God's Son as his Savior...

And sinners agree. ~ They want to produce the whole job of salvation.
Salvation that requires no work whatsoever on their part just does not 
compute, it just not appeal to them...

Of course Satan forgets to mention that the salvation that the sinner tries
to acquire through his own works will only bring failure...

The only thing a sinner needs to do is "Believe," God said. "Trust My
one and only Son as your Savior. Look to His cross and see salvation 
complete. Look at His empty tomb and see sin forgiven. Throw yourself
completely on Jesus' blood and righteousness and eternal life is yours."

All we have to do is believe. And even our faith is a gift of God's grace...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, for the gift of faith in Jesus, I thank You.
For its continuance, I trust You...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
