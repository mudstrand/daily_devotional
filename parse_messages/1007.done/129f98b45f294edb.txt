07/22/2010~~~food for thought~~~WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"What about you?" He [Jesus] asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered,
"You are the Christ." ~ (Mk. 8:29) 

Our Lesson for Today:
It's not that people don't know about Jesus. Rather, they don't really know who He is.
just as when the Savior walked on earth, so many give wrong answers to His question,
"Who do you say I am?"

"Your my supply sergeant," some answer. "You're the one whom I ask when I need 
this or that in my life," Unfortunately many popular preachers reinforce this error with
their shallow teaching...

Is that all Jesus means to you? Just some "genie in a bottle" who answers when you call?
What about the Jesus who warns you not to gain the world and lose your soul? Who talks
about taking up His cross and losing your life to save it?

There are so many shallow answers given to this question, "Who do you say Jesus is?"
WHY? Its because many have been listening to shallow preaching! And yes said to say
but some still think even after hearing good preaching, "I don't need Him yet, I don't need
a crouch yet...

Really with this kind of thinking they just may find out how much they do really need Him 
but ~ when it's to late...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me answer with Peter, "You are the Christ."
You are God Himself come into the flesh. Your blood paid
for my sin and your resurrection guarantees heaven. You are
my Savior..." Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
