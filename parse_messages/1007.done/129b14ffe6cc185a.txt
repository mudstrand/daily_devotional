07/08/2010~~~food for thought~~~FROM A NOBODY TO A SOMEBODY

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God;
once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
(I Pet. 2:10)

Our Lesson for Today:
So often we hear people who base their self-worth on their accomplishments.
But our relationship with Christ is far more important then our jobs, successes,
wealth or knowledge...

We should never forget we have been chosen by God as His very own, and we
have been called to represent Him to others. Remember that your value comes 
from being one of God's children, not from what you can achieve...

You have worth because of what God does, not because of what you do...
God's mercy in Christ Jesus has changed me from a nobody to a somebody,
a person He has included in His beautiful label "My people."

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, thank You for Your rich mercy in Christ Jesus
that really made me something...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
