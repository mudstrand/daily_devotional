07/21/2010~~~food for thought~~~OUT OF SIGHT ~ OUT OF MIND

Our Bible Verse for Today:
I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.
(Jer. 31:34)

Our Lesson for Today:
God sees and know my every sin. Even the ones I'm not aware of. Even the ones
I try to hide from other people's eyes. Not a single one of my sins escapes Him.
Every one of them earns His punishment that comes in the form of His displeasure
on earth and eternal death in hell...

So how come He says he remembers them no more? It can't be that they have slipped 
out of His mind or slowly fade from His remembrance. ~ No the answer is far more
blessed than that. It's because He forgives my wickedness. In His love, God sent
His beloved Son to take care of my sins...

His Son took each one of my sins to the cross of pain and the suffering of hell to pay
for them. Now the Father remembers them no more. His justice has been satisfied
by His Son's payment. ~ His Son's holiness counts for me...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, turn me in humble repentance for my many sins 
to the cross of Your Son. Let me see His love removing my 
sins from Your remembrance...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
