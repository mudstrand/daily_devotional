07/19/2010~~~food for thought~~~GOD'S LIGHTED PATH

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Your Word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path...Ps. 119:105

Our Lesson for Today:
To walk in the woods at night we need a light so we don't trip over tree
roots or stumble into some hole. In this life we are really walking through
a dark forest of evil...

But the Bible can be our light to show us a safe path so we won't stumble
as we walk. It reveals to us the entangling roots of false values and philosophies.

Let us remember to study the Bible so we will be able to see our way clear
enough to stay on the right path...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to learn Your Word so that 
I have safe travel down the path of life...Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
