07/02/09~~~food for thought~~~What do these words mean to you: "Christ-like"

Our Bible Verse for Today:
This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down
His life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for our 
brothers. (Christian brothers and sisters)...(I Jn. 3:16)

Our Lesson for Today:
"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life
for his friend." Here our Lord reveals to us the inconceivable love
that moved Him to die for us...

And now under the influence and in the power of that love dwelling
in us comes the message: 

"We ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters."

Nothing less is expected of us than a Christ-like life and a Christ-like
love proving itself in all our fellowship with believers...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord as we live daily in You, may we learn to lay down our lives
for one another as Christ did for us...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
