07/06/09~~~food for thought~~~Jesus will never leave us...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"And surely I am with you always to the
very end of the age." (Mt. 28:20b)

Our Lesson for Today:
So deep was the disciples consciousness of His presence,
that when Christ spoke of His leaving them to go to the Father,
their hearts were filled with deep sorrow...

The presence of Christ had become indispensable to them;
they could not think of living without Him... 

To comfort them, Christ gave them the promise of the Holy Spirit 
with the assurance that they then would have Himself in His heavenly 
presence in a sense far deeper and more intimate than they had ever 
known on earth...

The law of their first vocation remained unchanged: to be with Him,
to live in unbroken fellowship with Him would be the secret of power
to preach and to testify of Him...

Remember, it is by His Holy Spirit's presence that we receive the power
to witness of His love for all people...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, I thank You for Your abiding presence,
for the freshness and the power of the heavenly life...
