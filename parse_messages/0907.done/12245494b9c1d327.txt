Our Bible Verses for Today:
"If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed." (Jn. 8:36)

Because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life, 
set me free from the law of sin and death...(Ro. 8:2)

It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. 'Stand firm,' then,
and do not let yourselves be burden again by a yoke of slavery...
(Gal. 5:1)

Our Lesson for Today:
Christ died to set us free from sin and from a long list of laws 
and regulations. 'Yes ~ Christ came to set us free ~ not free 
to do whatever we want because that would lead us back into
slavery to our selfish desires...

But, thanks to Christ, we are now free and able to do what was 
impossible before ~ to live unselfishly.

Those who appeal to their freedom so they can have their own
way or indulge their own desires are falling back into sin. But
it is also wrong to put a burden of law keeping on Christians...

We must stand against those who would enslave us with rules
methods, or special conditions for being saved or growing in 
Christ...

Prayer Suggestion:
Thank You, Lord, for True Freedom, lead us in the truth...

Have a safe and happy 4th
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
