Our Bible Verse for Today:
This is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world (Jn. 4:42)

Our Lesson for Today:
Omnipotence and Omnipresence are what are called the natural attributes
of God. They have their true worth only ~ only when linked to and inspired
by His moral attributes, holiness and love...

When our Lord spoke of the omnipotence having been given Him
'all power on earth and in heaven' and the omnipresence 'His presence
with each of His disciples' His words pointed to all that which lies at
the root of all ~ His divine glory as the Savior of the world and Redeemer
of men...

It was because He humbled Himself and became obedient to death,
the death of the Cross, that God so highly exalted Him. His share as
the man Christ Jesus in the attributes of God was owing to the work He 
had done in His perfect obedience to the will of God and the finished 
redemption He had brought forth for the salvation of the world...

Yes, it is Jesus Christ who saves His people from their sins, who rules
over a people willing in the day of His power and proves in them that He
enables them to say, "I delight to do Thy will, O my God," who says,
"Lo, I am with you always."

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, You are the Savior of the world and
Redeemer of men. Help us to hear and obey Your command
to go into all the world and preach the Gospel and obey
all that You have commanded...
