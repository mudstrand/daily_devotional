Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul says once we become mature in the faith of Christ ~

Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth
by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of
teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their
deceitful scheming...

Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow
up into Him who is the Head, that is, Christ...

From Him the whole body, joined and held together by every 
supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each
part does its work...(Eph. 4:14-16) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

As Christians we sometimes fear that any mistake will destroy
our witness for the Lord. We see our weaknesses, and we think
that many non-Christians seem to have stronger characters than
we do...

And we wonder when will I ever grow up into Christ???

The answer is that Christ forms us into a body ~ into a group
of individuals who are united in their purpose and in their love 
for one another and for the Lord...

If an individual stumbles the rest of the group is there to pick
that person up and help him or her walk with God again. If a 
person sins, he or she can find restoration through the church
(Gal 6:1) even as the rest of the body continues to witness to
God's truth...

As part of Christ's body, do you reflect part of Christ's character
and carry out your special role in His work???

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father help me grow in the body, help
me to find my role in the body as a faithful witness. May
we lift one another up through Your power and strength...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will carry us through...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
