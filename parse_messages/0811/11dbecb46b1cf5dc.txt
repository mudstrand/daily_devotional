11/21/08~~~(food for thought)~~~As followers of Christ, we must be
committed to the truth...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you
must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of 
their thinking...(Eph. 4:17) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

The natural thinking of human beings is to think their way 
away from God ~ leaving them "hopelessly confused."
Intellectual pride, relations, and excuses all keep people
from God...

Don't be surprised if people can't grasp the Good News.
The Good News will seem foolish to those who forsake
faith and rely on their own understanding...

Our Prayer for Today
Dear Heavenly Father, sometimes Your ways are 
a bit confusing. So I pray for patience and wisdom
to accept Your will for my life. Protect our nation from
the deceptive ideals of mankind, and bless this nation
with Godly leaders...Amen.

Keep looking up, He has a plan for your life...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
