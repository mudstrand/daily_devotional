11/11/08~~~(food for thought)~~~God wants to be our guide...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my
sufferings for you, which are your glory...(Eph. 3:13) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Why should Paul's suffering make the Ephesians feel honored
and encouraged? ~~~

If Paul had not preached the Good News, he would not be in jail ~
but then the Ephesians would not have heard the message and 
been converted either...

Just as a mother endures the pain of child-birth in order to bring
new life into the world, Paul endured the pain of persecution in
order to bring new life to the believers in Christ...

Obeying Christ is never easy. He calls us to take our cross and 
follow Him (Mt. 16:24) ~ that is to be willing to endure pain so that 
God's message of salvation can reach the entire world...

We should feel honored that others have suffered and sacrificed 
so that we might reap the benefit...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that you would bless those who
have taken up their cross to make the message of salvation 
known to all who will listen. Soften the hearts of those who have 
not excepted...Amen.

Keep looking up in prayer...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
