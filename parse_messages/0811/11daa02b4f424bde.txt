11/17/08~~~(food for thought)~~~God is "over all" ~ "in us all" ~ and
"living through us all." This shows 
His overruling care....

Our Bible Verses for Today:

In our last devo. in vs. 8 it says: "He ascended"...

This means that Christ first came down to the lowly world
in which we live...

The same One who came down is the One who ascended
higher than all the heavens, so that His rule might fill the entire 
universe...(Eph. 4:9, 10) NLT

Our lesson for Today:

The "lowly world" may be:
(1) the earth itself (lowly by comparison to heaven).
(2) the grave, or
(3) Hades (many believe Hades is the resting place of souls
between death and resurrection).

However we understand it, Christ is Lord of the whole universe,
past, present, and future. Nothing or no one is hidden from Him...

The Lord of all came to earth and face death to rescue all people
no one is beyond His reach.

Any view of God that violates either His transcendence or
His immanence does not paint a true picture of God...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the gracious work 
of Your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. Who by His death and 
resurrection made possible eternal life for all who will receive 
Him as their Lord. I pray that there would one day be a great 
revival and that all would come to receive Him as their Savior...Amen.

Keep looking up, in love and adoration...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
