11/12/08~~~(food for thought)~~~God's faithfulness is constant...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

I pray that out of His glorious riches He may straighten you with
power through His Spirit in your inner being,

so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray
that you, being rooted and established in love,

may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide 
and long and high and deep is the love of Christ,

and to know this love that surpasses knowledge ~ that you may 
be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God...(Eph. 3:16-20) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

God's love is total, says Paul. It reaches every corner of our 
experience. 
it is wide - it covers the breadth of our own experience,
and it reaches out to the whole world. 
God's love is long - it continues the length of our life. 
It is high - it rises to the hights of our celebration and elation. 
His love is deep - it reaches to the depths of discouragement,
despair, and yes even death...

When you feel shut out or isolated, remember you can never
be lost to God's love...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your unconditional love.
Thank you Lord for loving me even when I am less than loveable.
Help me to have a Christ-like love for those who are also less
than loveable. I pray for our president elect, give him the wisdom
to remain in Your will...Amen.

Keep looking up, from whence cometh our strength...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
