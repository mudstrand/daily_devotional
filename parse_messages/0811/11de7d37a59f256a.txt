11/29/08~~~(food for thought)~~~Our life is of God, not of goods...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
God told Abram ~
"I will make you a great nation and I will bless you;
I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.
(Gen. 12:2) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

I have read various books indicating one cannot be prosperous
and also simple. This teaching is a bit disturbing to me because
I believe it is God's will for His people to be prosperous in every
area of their lives, including finances and material goods. Ps. 35:27
says that God takes pleasure in the prosperity of His people...

I cannot recall any Scripture saying God is pleased when His people
do not have their needs met.

Oh yes it is true that Scripture says it is hard for a rich man to get 
into heaven (see Mt. 19:23), but it is not impossible. Money can divert 
our attention away from God and His will, but it doesn't have to. We
should not be afraid of abundance; instead we should learn how to 
handle it properly...

If we maintain a proper attitude toward money and material things,
they can be used to bless many people...

Instead of telling people to totally abstain from something I'd rather 
try to teach them how to avoid excessiveness. Remember God
has created all thing for us to enjoy...

Prosperity and abundance only become a problem when we allow
them to own us instead of us owning them. We should use our
belongings to bless people. We need to be careful not to use people
to get more Stuff...

Money is only a problem if we hoard it. The Bible does not say money
is a problem; what it says is that, "the love of money is a problem." We 
need to learn to be a channel, not a reservoir. Let things flow to you and 
through you...

God is delighted when He finds someone He can generously bless
who will keep Him first and use what they have to be a blessing to
others...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for the many blessings I
have received in my life; help me to learn how to use my
blessings to be a blessing to others. Help me to be a channel
not a reservoir. Help to remember to always put You first...Amen.

Keep looking up, and you will be putting God first...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
