11/06/08~~~(food for thought)~~~God's Grace is sufficient...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

I became a servant of this Gospel by the gift of God's grace
given me through the working of His power...(Eph. 3:7) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

When Paul began spreading the Good News, God gave him
the ability to speak effectively. Now we may not be apostles
or even an evangelist, but God will give us the opportunity to
tell others about Christ...

With those opportunities God will provide the ability, courage, 
and power. Whenever an opportunity presents itself, we need
to make ourselves available to God as His servant...

As we focus on another person and his or her needs, God
will communicate your caring attitude. Your words will be
natural, loving and compelling...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, with each passing day I pray for a greater 
faith in You and with that faith I pray that I would fully trust in Your
grace. I pray that I would be sensitive to Your leading and guiding. 
Forgive me for any opportunities I may have neglected to address...Amen

Keep looking up, God will give you opportunity...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
