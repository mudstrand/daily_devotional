11/15/08~~~(food for thought)~~~All of God's children are promised 
eternal life. Are you one of God's children?

Our Bible Verses for Today:

To each one of us grace has been given as Christ 
apportioned it...
This is why it says: "When He ascended on high, He
led captives in His train and gave gifts to men."
(Eph. 4:7, 8) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

God's grace is beyond any human comprehension.
If we were asked to explain it, we could only make a feeble attempt...

Oh yes, we may list a number of gifts we have received from Him,
But the greatest gift we have been promised is eternal life, by
grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone...

And here is where words alone cannot shed adequate light on the
meaning of God's grace, for such undeserving people such as we...

Christ, in His crucifixion and resurrection was victorious over Satan.
Through Christ's victory, we have victory...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I cannot explain Your goodness and
mercy in human words, but I pray that through following You
my life might shed light on the true meaning of You grace...Amen.

Keep looking up, God's grace is sufficient...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
