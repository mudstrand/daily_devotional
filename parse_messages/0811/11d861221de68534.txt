Subject: 1/2 Boy - 1/2 Man (Our Soldiers)





1/2 boy 1/2 man
If you read this, you WILL forward it on. 
You just won't be able to stop yourself. 

T he average age of the military man is 19 years. 
He is a short haired, tight-muscled kid who, 
under normal circumstances is considered by 
society as half man, half boy. Not yet dry behind 
the ears, not old enough to buy a beer, but old 
enough to die for his country. He never really 
cared much for work and he would rather wax 
his own car than wash his 
father's, but he has 
never collected unemployment either. 



He's a recent High School graduate; he was probably 
an average student , pursued some form of sport 
activities, drives a ten year old jalopy, and has a 
steady girlfriend that either broke up with him when 
he left, or swears to be waiting when he returns from half a world away. He listens to rock and roll or hip-hop or rap or jazz or swing and a 155mm howitzer. 

He is 10 or 15 pounds lighter now than when he was at 
home because he is working or fighting from before dawn to well after dusk. He has 
trouble spelling, thus letter writing is a pain for him, 
but he can field strip a rifle in 30 seconds and 
reassemble it in less time in the dark. 



He can recite 
to you the nomenclature of a machine gun or grenade 
launcher and use either one effectively if he must. 

He digs foxholes and latrines and can apply first aid like a professional. 

He can march until he is told to stop, or stop until he is told to march. 



He obeys orders instantly and without hesitation, but he is not without spirit or individual dignity. He is self-sufficient. 

He has two sets of fatigues: he washes one and wears the other. 
He keeps his canteens full and his feet dry. 

He sometimes forgets to brush his teeth, but never to clean his rifle. He can cook his own meals, mend his own clothes, and fix his own hurts.

If you're thirsty, he'll share his water with you; if you are hungry, his food. He'll even split his ammunition with you in the midst of battle when you run
low. 

He has learned to use his hands like weapons and weapons like they were his hands. 

He can save your life - or take it, because that is his job. 

He will often do twice the work of a civilian, draw half the pay, and still find ironic humor in it all. 

He has seen more suffering and death than he should have in his short lifetime. 


He has wept in public and in private, for friends who have fallen in combat and is unashamed.

He feels every note of the National Anthem vibrate through his body while at rigid attention, while tempering the burning desire to 'square-away ' those around him who haven't bothered to stand, remove their hat, or even stop talking. 

In an odd twist, day in and day out, far from home, he defends their right to be disrespectful. 

Just as did his Father, 
Grandfat her, and Great - 
grandfather, he is paying the price for our freedom. Beardless or not, he is not a boy. He is the American Fighting Man that has kept this country free for over 200 years. 


He has asked nothing in return, except our friendship and understanding. Remember him, always, for he has earned our 
respect and admiration with his blood. 

And now we even have women over there in danger, doing their part in this tradition of going to War when our nation calls us to do so. 

As you go to bed tonight,
remember this shot. . . 

A short lull, a little shade and a picture of loved ones in their helmets. 


A Prayer wheel for our military... please don't 
break it Please send this on after a short prayer. 

Prayer Wheel 

'Lord, hold our troops in your loving hands. 
Protect them as they protect us. 
Bless them and their families for the selfless acts they perform for us in our time of need. Amen.' 


When you receive this, please stop for a moment and say a prayer for our troops in 
Afghanistan , sailors on ships, and airmen in the air, and for those in Iraq , Afghanistan 
and all foreign countries. 

There is nothing attached... 
This can be very powerful... 

Of all the gifts you could give a U.S. Airman, Soldier, 
Coastguardsman, Marine, 
or Sailor, prayer is the very best one. 

I can't break this one, sorry. 
Pass it on to everyone and pray
