all the world's riches...


Our Bible Verses for Today:

It was He who gave some to be apostles, some to be
prophets, and some to be evangelists,and some to be
pastor's and teachers,

to prepare God's people for works of service, so that 
the body of Christ may be built up...(Eph. 4:11, 12) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

We need to remember that our oneness in Christ does
not destroy our individuality...Why? because as we see
by our verses today ~ The Holy Spirit has given each 
Christian differing gifts for building up the church...

Because we have been given these gifts, it is crucial that we
use them. Have you matured spiritually, exercising these gifts
that have been given to you?

If you know what your gifts are, look for opportunities to serve.
If you don't know ask God to show you, perhaps with the help
of your pastor or some Christian friend, you will begin to recognize
your specail area of service...

We are to use our gifts to strengthen and encourage the body of
Christ (the church)...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to exercise the gifts You
have given me that I might be one with the body of Christ,
so that the church may stand against the wiles for Satan...Amen.

Keep looking up, He will show you where you are needed...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
