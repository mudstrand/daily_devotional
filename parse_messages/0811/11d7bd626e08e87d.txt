I have moved from our devo. in Eph. because of all the negativity
and worries I have heard during the election. Next week I will go
bact to Eph.


11/08/08~~~(food for thought)~~~Let God have your worries...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Don't worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself.
Each day has enough trouble of its own...(Mt. 6:34) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Our world is filled with trouble and distress, and because this
generation thrives on information, we are bombarded by all kinds
of stressful news...

God knows how this kind of negativity can cause anxiety. when 
we focus on problems whether personal or otherwise we have
a tendency to take our eyes off the Lord. And we temporarily 
forget what He can do...

So, the next time you began to feel anxious, just consider it a 
signal, a reminder that its time to turn, and run to God and lay
your worries at His feet! Ask for His help, ask Him to bring about 
change, Ask Him for hope and healing ~ and for miracles. 

Remember what Jesus says in (Mt. 11:28)
"Come to Me ~ all of you ~ who are weary and burdened, and
I will give you rest...

Jesus can free ~us all ~ from our worries. The "rest" that Jesus
promises is love, healing, and peace with God, not the end of
all labor.

A relationship with God changes meaningless, wearisome toil
into spiritual productivity and purpose...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, So often I worry about things that never
come into being possibly because you have taken care of them
even though I have forgotten to pray. Help me to take my worries 
as a signal to turn and run to You. Lord I want to lift up this countries
worries about our president elect. Give Him Godly wisdom to govern
this country according to Your will...Amen.

Keep looking up, pray for our country and the world...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
