11/07/08~~~(food for thought)~~~Where would we be if it were not for God's grace...

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Paul says: "Although I am less than the least of all God's
people, this grace was given to me: to preach to the Gentiles
the unsearchable riches of Christ"...(Eph. 3:8) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

When Paul describes himself as "Less than the least of all
God's people," He means that without God's help, we would
never be able to do God's work...

Nevertheless God chose him to share the Good News with the
Gentiles and gave him the power to do it...

If we feel our role is minor, we may be right ~ except that we have
forgotten what a difference God makes. We need to ask ourselves 
each day, "How does God want to use me today?"

Each day we need to draw on His power, then do our part, and
faithfully perform the special role God has called us to play in
His plan...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I know that I was created for a purpose
make clear to me today the role You want me to play in that
plan. Instill in me the grace to achieve the role You have for me...Amen.

Keep looking up, God will reveal His plan for you...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
