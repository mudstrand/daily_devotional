Our Bible Verse for Today:

For this reason I, Paul the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the
sake of you Gentiles...(Eph. 3:1) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

How often have you skimmed over a verse like this one, 
without giving any thought at all to it???

You may say, "Well it does not have any doctrinal worth to it,
so of what value is it?"

You are right on that account, but it may help us to deal with
the problems we see in today's world, so let us examine Paul's
situation...

When Paul wrote this letter he was under house arrest in Rome
for preaching about Christ. Why? 

Well the religious leaders in Jerusalem, were feeling threatened 
by Christ's teachings and didn't believe He was the Messiah. So, 
they pressured the Romans to arrest Paul and bring him to trial for 
treason and for causing rebellion among the Jews...

Paul had appealed for his case to be heard by the emperor, and
he was awaiting trials we see in (Acts 28:16-31)...

Even though Paul was under arrest he maintained his firm belief
that God was in control of all that happened to him...

The circumstances that we find ourselves in this election year,
have you wondered if God has lost control of this world???

Like Paul, remember that no matter what happens, God directs 
the world's affairs...Ya-but what about all the difficulties we find
happening in the world?

Think about this ~ what does the first commandment say?
"Thou shalt have no other Gods before Me." 

Have we really made God our first priority? The Bible tells us we
cannot worship God and money...What is the most important thing 
in your life?

Like it or not we are probably getting what we deserve...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive us our sins of omission,
that is of omitting to put You first in our life. Help us to 
refocus our love by putting You first...Amen.

Keep looking up, where our focus should be...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
