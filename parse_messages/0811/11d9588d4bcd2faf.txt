11/13/08~~~(food for thought)~~~God will not be moved...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

(Paul calls for the unity in the body of Christ)

As a prisoner for the Lord then, I urge you to live a life
worthy of the calling you have received...

Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with 
one another in love...(Eph. 4:1, 2) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

A fact that we need to remember is that God has called 
each of us to be Christ's representatives on earth...

In light of this truth, Paul challenges us to live lives worthy
of the calling we have received ~~~ What an awesome privilege 
of be called Christ's very own...

This includes being humble, gentle, patient, understanding,
and peaceful. people are watching our every action...

Can they see Christ in your life? How well are you doing as His 
representative???

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I have to confess that I do not always
do so well as Your representative, forgive me for falling short
of Your calling. Help me to be more humble, gentle, patient, and
loving...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is the Rock of our Salvation...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
