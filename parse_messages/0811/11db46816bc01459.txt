11//19/08~~~(food for thought)~~~God wants to see unity in the church...

Our Bible Verses for Today:

(Yes God!)
Yes it was He who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets,
some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers,

to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of
Christ may be built up,

until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son 
of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the 
fullness of Christ...(Eph. 4:11-13) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

(Yes God) has given His church an enormous responsibility ~ to make
disciples of every nation (Mt. 28:18-20).

This involves preaching, teaching, healing, nurturing, giving, administering,
building, and many other tasks. If we had to fulfill this task as individuals,
we might as well give up without trying ~ it would be impossible...

But God ~ calls us as members of His body. Some of us can do one
task; some can do another. Together we can obey God more fully
than we can alone...

It is a human tendency to underestimate what we can do as a group.
But as the body of Christ, we can accomplish more together that we
ever dreamed possible working by ourselves...

Working together, the church can express the fullness of Christ...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive us for not working together
as we should. Help us to become more unified in the body 
of Christ. Help us to always be mindful of the responsibility
that You have set before us...Amen.

Keep looking up, God wants to walk with us...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
