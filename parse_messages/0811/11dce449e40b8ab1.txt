Our Bible Verses for Today:

You were taught with regard to your former way of life, 
to put off your former way of life, to put off your old self,
which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;

to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put
on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness
and holiness... (Eph. 4:22-24) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Our old way of life before we believed in Christ is completely
in the past. We should put it behind us like old clothes to be
thrown away...

When we decide to accept Christ's gift of salvation (2:8-10),
it is both a one time decision, as well as a daily conscious
commitment. We are not to be driven by desire and impulse...

We must put on the new nature, head in the new direction, AND
have the new way of thinking that the Holy Spirit gives...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to make a daily conscious
commitment to live by the new nature that is Christ's gift.
Help me to head in the direct that the Holy Spirit leads...Amen.

Keep looking up, head in the new direction...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
