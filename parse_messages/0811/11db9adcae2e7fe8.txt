What Love means to a 4-8 year old . . .
Slow down for three minutes to read this. 
It is so worth it. Touching words from the
mouth of babes. 
A group of professional people posed this question 
to a group of 4 to 8 year-olds, 'What does love mean?'

The answers they got were broader and deeper than anyone 
could have imagined. See what you think.






'When my grandmother got arthritis,
she couldn't bend over and paint her toenails anymore.
So my grandfather does it for her all the time,
even when his hands got arthritis too.
That's love.'

Rebecca- age 8





'When someone loves you, the way
they say your name is different.
You just know that your name
is safe in their mouth.'

Billy - age 4





'Love is when a girl puts on perfume
and a boy puts on shaving cologne and they go out and
smell each other.'

Karl - age 5





'Love is when you go out to eat and
give somebody most of your French fries without making
them give you any of theirs.'

Chrissy - age 6




'Love is what makes you smile when you're tired.'

Terri - age 4





'Love is when my mommy makes coffee
for my daddy and she takes a sip before giving it to him,
to make sure the taste is OK.'

Danny - age 7





'Love is when you kiss all the time.
Then when you get tired of kissing, you still want to be
together and you talk more.
My Mommy and Daddy
are like that. They look gross when they kiss'

Emily - age 8





'Love is what's in the room with you
at Christmas if you stop opening presents and
listen.'

Bobby - age 7 (Wow!)





'If you want to learn to love
better, you should start with a friend who you hate,'

Nikka - age 6
(we need a few million more Nikka's on this planet)





'Love is when you tell a guy you
like his shirt, then he wears it everyday.'

Noelle - age 7




'Love is like a little old woman and
a little old man who are still friends even after they
know each other so well.'

Tommy - age 6






'During my piano recital, I was on a
stage and I was scared. I looked at all the people
watching me and saw my
daddy waving and smiling.
He was the only one doing
that. I wasn't scared anymore.'

Cindy - age 8






'My mommy loves me more than
anybody You don't see
anyone else kissing me to sleep at night.'

Clare - age 6






'Love is when Mommy gives Daddy the
best piece of chicken.'

Elaine-age 5






'Love is when Mommy sees Daddy
smelly and sweaty and still says he is handsomer than
Robert Redford.'

Chris - age 7





'Love is when your puppy licks your
face even after you left him alone all day.'

Mary Ann - age 4






'I know my older sister loves me
because she gives me all her old clothes and has to go
out and buy new ones.'

Lauren - age 4




'When you love somebody, your
eyelashes go up and down and little stars come out of
you.' (what an image)

Karen - age 7






this one
'Love is when Mommy sees Daddy on
the toilet and she doesn't think it's gross.'


Mark - age 6








'You really shouldn't say 'I love
you' unless you mean it. But if you mean it, you
should say it a lot. People forget.'

Jessica - age 8






And the final one

The winner was a four year old child whose next door 
neighbor was an elderly gentleman who had recently 
lost his wife.

Upon seeing the man cry, the little boy went into 
the old gentleman's yard, climbed onto his lap, 
and just sat there.

When his Mother asked what he had said to the neighbor, the
little boy said,

'Nothing, I just helped him cry'





When there is nothing left but God,
that is when you find out that God is all you need. 
Take 60 seconds and give this a shot! 
All you do is simply say the following small
prayer for the person who sent you this.

Heavenly Father, please bless all my friends in whatever 
it is that You know they may be needing this day! 

And may their life be full of Your peace, prosperity
and power as he/she seeks to have a closer relationship 
with You. Amen.

Then send it on to five other people, including the one 
who sent it to you.
Within hours you caused a multitude of people to pray 
for other people. 
Then sit back and watch the power of God work in your life.

P. S. Five is good, but more is better.
