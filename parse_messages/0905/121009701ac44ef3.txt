Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that
believeth that Jesus is the Son of God." (I Jn. 5:5)

Our Lesson for Today:

Christ spoke strongly of the world hating Him. His kingdom
and the kingdom of this world are in hostility with one another...

John understood the lesson and summed it up in these words.
"We know that we are of God and the whole world lieth in wickedness."
"Love not the world, nor the things that are of the world."
"If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in Him."

The world still exerts a terrible influence over the Christian who does
not know that in Christ he has been crucified to the world. In the
pleasure in eating and drinking, in the love and enjoyment of what there
is to be seen of its glory, and in all that constitutes the pride of life. the
power of this world proves itself...

Most Christians are either utterly ignorant of the danger of a worldly
spirit or feel themselves utterly powerless to conquer it...

But Christ has left us a great promise: "Be of good cheer, I have overcome 
the world." So take the time to ask yourself whether you believe with your
whole heart in the victory that faith gives over the world...

Put your trust in the mighty power of God, in the abiding presence of Jesus 
as the only pledge of certain and continual victory...

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray for a life entirely possessed by the faith of Jesus to maintain
the victor's attitude at all times...
