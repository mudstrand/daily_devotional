Subject: Muslim beliefs







This is a true story and the
>> author, Rick Mathes, is a well-known leader in prison
>> ministry. The man who walks with God always gets to his
>> destination. If you have a pulse you have a purpose.
>>
>> The Muslim religion is the
>> fastest growing religion per capita in the United States,
>> especially in the minority races!!!
>>
>> Last month I attended my
>> annual training session that's required for maintaining
>> my state prison security clearance. During the training
>> session there was a presentation by three speakers
>> representing the Roman Catholic, Protestant and Muslim
>> faiths, who explained each of their beliefs.
>>
>> I was particularly interested
>> in what the Islamic Imam had to say. The Imam gave a great
>> presentation of the basics of Islam, complete with a video.
>>
>> After the presentations, time
>> was provided for questions and answers.
>>
>> When it was my turn, I
>> directed my question to the Imam and asked: 'Please,
>> correct me if I'm wrong, but I understand that most
>> Imams and clerics of Islam have declared a holy jihad [Holy
>> war] against the infidels of the world and, that by killing
>> an infidel, (which is a command to all Muslims) they are
>> assured of a place in heaven. If that's the case, can
>> you give me the definition of an infidel?'
>>
>> There was no disagreement with
>> my statements and, without hesitation, he replied,
>> 'Non-believers!'
>>
>> I responded, 'So, let me
>> make sure I have this straight. All followers of Allah have
>> been commanded to kill everyone who is not of your faith so
>> they can have a place in heaven. Is that correct?'
>>
>> The expression on his face
>> changed from one of authority and command to that of a
>> little boy who had just been caught with his hand in the
>> cookie jar.'
>>
>> He sheepishly replied,
>> 'Yes.'
>>
>> I then stated, 'Well, sir,
>> I have a real problem trying to imagine Pope John Paul
>> commanding all Catholics to kill those of your faith or Dr.
>> Stanley ordering all protestants to do the same in order to
>> guarantee them a place in heaven!'
>>
>> The Imam was speechless!
>>
>> I continued, 'I also have
>> a problem with being your friend when you and your brother
>> clerics are telling your followers to kill me!
>>
>> Let me ask you a question:
>> Would you rather have your Allah, who tells you to kill me
>> in order for you to go to heaven, or my Jesus who tells me
>> to love you because I am going to heaven and He wants you to
>> be there with me?'
>>
>> You could have heard a pin
>> drop as the Imam hung his head in shame. Needless to say,
>> the organizers and/or promoters of the Diversification
>> training seminar were not happy with my way of dealing with
>> the Islamic Imam, and exposing the truth about the
>> Muslims' beliefs.
>>
>> In twenty years there will be
>> enough Muslim voters in the U.S. to elect the President!
>>
>> I think everyone in the U.S.
>> should be required to read this, but with ACLU, there is
>> likely no way this will be widely publicized, unless each of
>> us send it on! This is our chance to make a difference...
>>
>> FOR GODS' SAKE! SEND
>> THIS ON!
