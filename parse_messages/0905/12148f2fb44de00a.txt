05/16/09~~~food for thought~~~Let us prepare our hearts to truly give glory to our creator...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Bless His glorious name forever!
Let the whole earth be filled with His Glory.
Amen and Amen! (Ps. 72:19)

Our Lesson for Today:

What a prospect! This earth now under the power of the Evil One
renewed and filled with the glory of God ~ a new earth where 
righteousness dwells. Though we believe it so little, it will surely 
come to pass; God's Word is the promise of it...

God's Son by His blood and death conquered the power of sin,
and through the Eternal Spirit the power of God is working out His
purpose. What a vision, the whole earth filled with His glory!!!

What a wonderful prayer! For all of Chapter 72 is a prayer ~
"Let the whole earth be filled with His glory; Amen, and Amen."

What a blessing it is to know that true prayer will indeed help and 
be answered! What a blessedness every day of our lives to seek
God's face, with confidence to lay hold of Him and give Him no rest 
till the earth is full of His Glory!

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear heavenly Father, what a blessing it is to unite this
day with Your power along with all Your willing children
who are seeking to prepare the way for our King! Amen.
