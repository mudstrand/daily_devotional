WHAT A SHAME!

"Senior" status is something we all face (IF we're lucky), so read 
this. Especially note Daschle's statement about the elderly! 

Then forward, like I'm doing! Guess we'd best start praying that 
this health care plan fails like Hillary's did.................. 

WHAT A SHAME 

Everybody that is on this mailing list is either a senior citizen, 
is getting close or knows somebody that is. 
Most of you know by now that the Senate version (at least) of the 
"stimulus" bill includes provisions for extensive rationing of 
health care for senior citizens. The author of this part of the 
bill, former senator and tax evader, Tom Daschle was credited today 
by Bloomberg with the following statement. 

Bloomberg: "Daschle says health-care reform will not be pain free. 
Seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with 
age instead of treating them." 

If this does not sufficiently raise your ire, just remember that Senators and Congressmen have their own healthcare plan that is 
first dollar or very low co-pay which they are guaranteed the 
remainder of their lives and are not subject to this new law if it 
passes. 

Please use the power of the Internet to get this message out. Talk 
it up at the grassroots level. We have an election coming up in one 
year and nine months. We have the ability to address and reverse 
the dangerous direction the Obama administration and it allies have 
begun and in the interim, we can make their lives miserable. Lets 
do it! 

If you disagree, don't do anything.
