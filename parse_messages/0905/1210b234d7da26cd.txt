05/04/09~~~food for thought~~~What does your character reveal to others?

Our Bible Verses for Today:
On one occasion, while He was eating with them, He gave this
command: "Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift My
Father promised, which you have heard Me speak about...
For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be
baptized with the Holy Spirit." (Acts 1:4-5)

Our Lesson for Today:
After our Lord had given the command: "Go into all the world
and preach the Gospel to every creature," He again added
another, His very last command: "Wait till you receive the power
from above." "Wait for the promise of the Father." "You will
be baptized with the Holy Spirit."

All Christians agree that the great command to preach the Gospel 
to every creature was not only for the disciples but is binding on us
too...

But it seems that all do not appear to consider that the very last command,
not to preach until they had received the power from on high is equally
binding on us as it was on the disciples...

The Church appears to have lost possession of that which ought to be
to her a secret of secrets ~ the abiding consciousness, day by day, that 
it is only as she lives in the power of the Holy Spirit that she can preach the
Gospel in demonstration of the Spirit and of power...

So let us seek earnestly the grace of the Holy Spirit, who alone can Himself
reveal to us what eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath entered into
the heart of man to conceive ~ the things which God hath done and loves
to do for them that wait upon Him...

Prayer Suggestion:
Let us fervently pray for the power of the Holy Spirit.
