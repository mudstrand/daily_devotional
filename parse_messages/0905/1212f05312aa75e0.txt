05/10/09~~~food for thought~~~We wonder what is going to happen to our Governmant ~ BUT
Let us remember that the only kingdom that will prevail in this world,
is the kingdom that is not of this world...

Our Bible Verses for today:
"Ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit." (Acts 1:5)
"Ye shall receive power when the Holy Spirit
is come upon you." *Acts 1:8)

Our Lesson for Today:

The third mark of the Church ~ the power for service through the Holy Spirit.
Since the time of Adam's fall when he lost the spirit God had breath into him,
God's Spirit had striven with people, and worked in some with power, BUT He
had never been able to find His permanent home in them...

It was only when Christ had come and by His death had broken the power
of sin and had won in the resurrection a new life for all to live in Himself, that
the Spirit of God could come and take possession of the whole heart and
make it a dwelling place for Christ and for God...

The Spirit now reveals Christ in us as first of all our life and then our strength 
for a perfect obedience and the preaching of the Word in the power of God...

Amazing mystery! The Spirit of God, our life; the Spirit of Christ, our light and
strength. It is as men and women who are led by this Spirit of the first disciples,
that we shall have the power to pray the effectual prayer of the righteous that
availeth much...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Father we thank You for Your Holy Spirit who descends
to live with-in believers to take possession of them as God's
Holy temple...
