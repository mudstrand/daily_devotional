06/01/09~~~food for Thought~~~Let us discontinue selfish prayers...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Give us day by day our daily bread." (Lk. 11:3)

Our Lesson for Today:

There are many Christians who are afraid of the thoughts of a promise
to pray every day as being far beyond their capability...

They feel that they could not uphold this promise ~ but yet they pray to
God to give them their bread day by day. If the children of God once
yielded themselves with their whole lives to God's love and service, they
should count it a privilege to avail themselves of any invitation that would
help them every day to come into God's Presence with the great need
of His Church and Kingdom...

Are there not many who confess that they desire to live wholly for God?

Are there not many who acknowledge that Christ gave Himself for them?

Are there not many who say that In His love He watches over them and
works in them without ceasing?

And aren't there many that admit that nothing less than the measure of the 
love of Christ to us should be the measure of our love to Him?

Don't they also feel that this ought to be the standard of their life?

If this be true, shouldn't they welcome every opportunity for proving day by 
day that they are devoting their heart's strength to the interest of Christ's
Kingdom and to the prayer that can bring down God's blessing?

To those who have to confess that they have not totally understood the high 
privilege and the solemn duty of waiting on God in prayer for His blessing
on the world should now welcome the invitation...

Prayer Suggestion:
Enlarge my vision to include daily united prayer for
all of Your children and all the work of Your Kingdom...
