TWO SUBJECT LINES TO BEWARE OF : 


Just verified this with Snopes and it is REAL. ALSO WENT TO TRUTH OR
>FICTION,IT'S on their site also. 



PLEASE INFORM EVERYONE you know! 




Emails with pictures of Osama Bin-Laden hanged are being sent and the
moment that you open these emails your computer will crash and you
will not be able to fix it!



1.) If you get an e-mail along the lines of 'Osama Bin Laden Captured'
or 'Osama Hanged' , don't open the Attachment!!!! 




This e-mail is being distributed through countries around the globe,
but mainly in the US and Israel 




Be considerate & send this warning to whomever you know... 



PLEASE FORWARD THIS WARNING AMONG FRIENDS, FAMILY AND CONTACTS: 



2.) You should be alert during the next few days:




Do not open any message with an attached file called 'Invitation'
regardless of who sent it. 




It is a virus that opens an Olympic Torch which 'burns' the whole hard
disc C of your computer!!!! 




This virus will be received from someone who has your e-mail address
in his/her contact list, that is why you should send this E-mail to
all your contacts. 



It is better to receive this message 25 times than to receive the
virus and open it 




If you receive e-mail called 'invitation', even though sent by a
friend. Do not open it!!! Shut down your computer immediately!!!! 





This is the worst virus announced by CNN, it has been classified by
Microsoft as the most destructive virus ever.





This virus was discovered by McAfee yesterday, and there is no repair
yet for this kind of virus. 





This virus simply destroys the Zero Sector of the Hard Disc, where the
vital information is kept. 




SEND THIS E-MAIL TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW!!!!!!
