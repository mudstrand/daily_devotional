05/19/09~~~food for thought~~~How unified is your congregation?

Our Bible Verses for Today:
After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was 
shaken, and they were filled with the Holy Spirit and they
spoke the word of God boldly. ~ All the believers were one 
in heart and mind. (Acts 4:31~32a)

Our Lesson for Today:

Today we are attacked on every side ~ Big business are folding up, 
there are influenza scares, tourist scares, contaminated food scares,
gun control scares, our retirements or savings will be lost, the list
goes on and on...

It's enough to make one just cover up his head and stay in bed. We
need more boldness. ~ Boldness is not reckless impulsiveness...

Boldness requires courage to press on through our fears and do what
we know is right. ~ So the important question is 'how can we become 
bold???

Like the disciple, we need to pray with others for that courage. To gain
boldness, you can (1) pray for the power of the Holy Spirit to give you
courage, (2) look for opportunities in your family and neighborhood to 
talk about Christ, (3) realize that rejection, social discomfort, and 
embarrassment are not necessarily persecution, and (4) start where you 
are by being bolder in small ways...

Satin would have us to be all entangled with the things of the world, 
so that he can draw our attention away from the things of God...

Oh yes differences of opinion are inevitable among human personalities
and at times can actually be helpful if handled well. But spiritual unity is 
essential ~ loyalty, commitment, and love for God and His Word...

Without unity, the Christian Church as we know it will be over come and
we will go the way of Satin...

Prayer Suggestion:
Lord Jesus, help us to become one again unified in the Word
give us boldness to share what You have done, and can do
for those who will believe...
