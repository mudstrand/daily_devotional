Subject: I think this is a great idea


This is TRUE according to snopes.com
WHEN ENOUGH GOOD PEOPLE DO NOTHING, EVERYTHING CHANGES. IF THE MAJORITY IS SUPPOSED TO RULE, THEY HAVE TO SPEAK UP.
I hope each of us will choose at least one thing we can do to STAND UP for the majority. 




Payback is fun!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
WRITE IT ON THE BACK OF YOUR ENVELOPES 
WE THINK THIS IS A GREAT IDEA. WE'LL START WRITING IT ON THE FRONT OF OUR ENVELOPES, TOO! ! Including Bills 


You may have heard in the news that a couple of Post Offices in Texas have been forced to take down small posters that say 

'IN GOD WE TRUST ,' The law,they say, is being violated. 

Anyway, we heard proposed on a radio station show, that we should all write ' IN GOD WE TRUST' 
on the back of all our mail. After all, that's our National Motto, and it's on all the money we use to buy those stamps. We think it's a wonderful idea. 

We must take back our nation from all the people who think that anything that offends them should be removed. 

If you like this idea, please pass it on and DO IT. The idea of writing or stamping! 
'IN GOD WE TRUST ' on our envelopes sounds good to us . WE'RE HAVING A STAMP MADE TOO! Heck,lets use it as our signature on e-mails too! 

It's been reported that 86% of Americans believe in God. Therefore, we have a very hard time understanding why there's such a mess about having 'In God We Trust!' on our money and having God in the pledge of Allegiance . 

Could it be that WE just need to take action and tell the 14% to 'sit down and be quiet'? Majority rules!!! 

If you agree, pass this on, if not, delete!!! BUT REMEMBER IF YOU DELETE THIS,that's 1 reason why this country is in the mess we're in now. WE SIT BACK & LET IT HAPPEN!!
