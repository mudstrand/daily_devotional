05/20/09~~~food for thought~~~Do your works bear the signature of Jesus?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Whatsoever you shall ask in My Name, that will I do,
that the Father may be glorified in the Son." (Jn. 14:13)

Our Lesson for Today:

How wonderful it is to think that there is a link between our prayers
and Christ's glorifying the Father in Heaven. What an incentive that
should be to much prayer, to unceasing intercession...

So deep was the desire of Christ in the last night that His disciples 
should learn to believe in the power of His Name and to avail them-
selves of His promise of a sure and abundant answer, that we find
the promise repeated seven times...

Jesus knew how slow we are to believe in the wonderful promise of
answer to prayer in His name. He longs to rouse a large and confident
faith and to free our prayers from every shadow of a doubt and to teach
us to look upon intercession as the most certain and most blessed way 
of bringing glory to God. It will bring joy to our own souls, and blessings
to the perishing world around us...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Heavenly Father, it is my prayer that everything
in my daily life would bear the signature of the name 
of Jesus...
