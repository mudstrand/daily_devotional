to make good use of today...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man
availeth much" (James 5:16)

Our Thought for Today:

Prayer availeth much. It avails much with God. It avails much in
the history of His Church and people. Prayer is the one great 
power which the Church can exercise in securing the working of 
God's omnipotence in the world...

"The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much."
It is only when the righteous man stirs up himself and rouses his 
whole being to take hold of God that the prayer availeth much.
As Jacob said: "I will not let thee go"; as the importunate widow
gave the judge no rest, so it is that the effectual fervent prayer 
effects great things

When two or three agree, there is the promise of an answer.
Think of how much when hundreds and thousands unite with one
objective to cry to God to display His Mighty power on behalf
of His people...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear heavenly Father, may we all join those who have united
themselves to call upon thee for the mighty power of Your Holy 
Spirit in Your Church. Let each of Your people pray individually
and united for the grace of the effectual fervent prayer which 
availeth much...
