05/14/09~~~food for thought~~~Does Christ have first place in your heart?

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"The Spirit of truth, shall testify of Me, and You shall also
bear witness, because you have been with Me from the
beginning." (Jn. 15:26-27)

Our Lesson for Today:

"My witness ~ not only refers to all pastors, but also every believer.
This is a high calling and also the only power of the preacher of the 
Gospel ~ in everything a pastor is to be a witness for Jesus...

This gives us two truths. the first, that with all that the preacher teaches 
from the Word of God or according to the need of the congregation, he
must first of all place the preaching of Christ Himself ahead of all else...

This is what the disciples did...

The minister of the Gospel may never forget that it is for this specially
that he has been set apart, to be with the Holy Spirit a witness for Christ...

But there is a second thought which isn't any less important. And that is,
that the teaching must always be a personal testimony from experience 
to what Christ is and can do...

It is precisely this that will build up believers so that they can walk in such
fellowship with Jesus Christ that He can reveal Himself through them...

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray for such a sensitivity to the Holy Spirit's leading that
the abundance of the Spirit would go forth from your mouth 
praising and giving glory to our blessed Redeemer, Jesus 
Christ or Lord.
