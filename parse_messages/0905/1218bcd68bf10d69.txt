05/29/09~~~food for thought~~~Pray that God's Spirit will fill the hearts of His people...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"Continue in prayer. and watch in the same with thanksgiving,
withal praying also for us." (Col. 4:2-3)

Our lesson for Today:

Prayer for all saints: let this be our first thought. It will need time
and thought and love to realize what is included in that simple
expression...

Think of your own neighborhood and all the saints you know; think
of our whole country and praise God for all who are His saints;
think of all Christian nations of the world and the saints to be found
in each of these;

think of all the heathen nations and the saints of God to be found
among them in ever-increasing numbers.

Think of all the different circumstances and conditions in which
these are to be found and all the varying needs which call for God's 
grace and help.

Think of the many, oh, so many, who are God's saints and yet through
ignorance or sloth, through worldly-mindedness or an evil heart of
unbelief are walking in the dark and bringing no honor to God.

Think of so many who are in earnest and yet conscious of a life of failure,
with little or no power to please God or to bless man. And then think again 
of those who are found everywhere, in solitary places or in companies,
whose one aim is to serve the Lord who bought them to be the light of 
those around them...

This is not the work of one day or one night. It needs a heart which will
set itself from time to time to do serious thinking in regard to the state
and the need of the body of Christ to which we all belong...

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray daily for the love of God and Christ to fill our hearts ~ and ~
for the power of the Holy Spirit to come down and accomplish
His work in this sinful world...
