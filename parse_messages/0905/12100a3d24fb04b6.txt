Take time to read and ponder. This is a great message and a
lesson that should be taught at home, at work and in the
classroom.


The Seed A successful business man was growing old and knew
it was time to choose a successor to take over the business.

Instead of choosing one of his Directors or his children,
he decided to do something different. He called all the
young executives in his company together.

He said, "It is time for me to step down and choose
the next CEO. I have decided to choose one of you "The
young executives were shocked, but the boss continued.
"I am going to give each one of you a SEED today -

one very special SEED.

I want you to plant the seed, water it, and come back here
one year from today with what you have grown from the seed I
have given you.

I will then judge the plants that you bring, and the one I
choose will be the next CEO."

One man, named Jim, was there that day and he, like the
others, received a seed. He went home and excitedly, told
his wife the story. She helped him get a pot, soil and
compost and he planted the seed. Everyday, he would water it
and watch to see if it had grown. After about three weeks,
some of the other executives began to talk about their seeds
and the plants that were beginning to grow.

Jim kept checking his seed, but nothing ever grew.

Three weeks, four weeks, five weeks went by, still nothing.

By now, others were talking about their plants, but Jim
didn't have a plant and he felt like a failure.

Six months went by -- still nothing in Jim's pot. He
just knew he had killed his seed. Everyone else had trees
and tall plants, but he had nothing. Jim didn't say
anything to his colleagues, however.

He just kept watering and fertilizing the soil - He so
wanted the seed to grow.

A year finally went by and all the young executives of the
company brought their plants to the CEO for inspection.

Jim told his wife that he wasn't going to take an empty
pot.

But she asked him to be honest about what happened. Jim
felt sick to his stomach, it was going to be the most
embarrassing moment of his life, but he knew his wife was
right. He took his empty pot to the board room. When Jim
arrived, he was amazed at the variety of plants grown by the
other executives. They were beautiful -- in all shapes and
sizes. Jim put his empty pot on the floor and many of his
colleagues laughed, a few felt sorry for him!

When the CEO arrived, he surveyed the room and greeted his
young executives.

Jim just tried to hide in the back.

"My, what great plants, trees, and flowers you have grown,"

said the CEO. "Today one of you will be appointed the next CEO!"

All of a sudden, the CEO spotted Jim at the back of the
room with his empty pot. He ordered the Financial Director
to bring him to the front. Jim was terrified. He thought,
"The CEO knows I'm a failure! Maybe he will have me
fired!"

When Jim got to the front, the CEO asked him what had
happened to his seed - Jim told him the story.

The CEO asked everyone to sit down except Jim. He looked at
Jim, and then announced to the young executives,
"Behold your next Chief Executive Officer!

His name is Jim!" Jim couldn't believe it. Jim
couldn't even grow his seed. "How could he be the
new CEO?" the others said.

Then the CEO said, "One year ago today, I gave
everyone in this room a seed. I told you to take the seed,
plant it, water it, and bring it back to me today. But I
gave you all boiled seeds; they were dead - it was not
possible for them to grow.

All of you, except Jim, have brought me trees and plants
and flowers. When you found that the seed would not grow,
you substituted another seed for the one I gave you. Jim was
the only one with the courage and honesty to bring me a pot
with my seed in it. Therefore, he is the one who will be the
new Chief Executive Officer!"
