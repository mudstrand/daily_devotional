05/13.09~~~food for thought~~~Why do some churches flourish and others don't? 

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"Ye shall be my witnesses" (Acts 1:8)

Our Lesson for Today:

A mark of Christ's Church is ~ His servants are witnesses to Him,
ever testifying of His wonderful love, of His power to redeem, of
His continual abiding presence, and of His wonderful power in
them...

This is the only weapon that the King allows His redeemed ones
to use. Without claiming authority or power, without wisdom or
eloquence, without influence or position, each one is called, not
only by his words but by his life and action ~ to be a living proof
and witness of what Jesus can do...

This is the only weapon they are to use in conquering souls and
bringing them to the feet of Christ...

Here we have the secret of a flourishing Church: every believer
a witness for Jesus. Here we have the cause of weakness of 
the Church: so few who are willing in daily life to testify that Jesus
is Lord...

Prayer Suggestion:
Lord teaches us one and all about the blessedness of so 
knowing Jesus and the power of His love, that we may find 
our highest joy in witnessing to what He is and has done in us...
