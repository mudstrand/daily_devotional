04/03/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ Be more concerned about what God thinks of you 
than what people think about you...(Acts 5:29)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul says: "Listen I will tell you a mystery: We will not all
sleep, but we will be changed ~

in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. for
the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable,
and we will be changed...(I Cor 15:51, 52) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Christian who are still alive when Christ returns will not have to die,
but will be transformed immediately...

A trumpet blast will usher in the new heaven and the new earth...

The Jews would understand the significance of this because trumpets
were always blown to signal the start of a great festivals and other
extraordinary events...

What will you be doing when the last Trumpet blows?
Will you be ready when the Lord returns?

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that I would always be 
focused on You, so that when You return you will find
me faithful. Forgive me be being less than faithful...Amen.

Keep looking up, even when we are not faithful
He is faithful, and will be faithful to the end...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
