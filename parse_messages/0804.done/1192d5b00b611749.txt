Our Bible Verses for Today:

Now about the collection for God's people; Do what I told the 
Galatian churches to do...

On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside 
a sum of money in keeping with his income, saving it up, so that
when I come no collections will have to be made...

Then when I arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men you
approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem...

If it seems advisable for me to go also, they will accompany me...
(I Cor. 16:1-4) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Each person was to set aside an amount proportionate to his income
and bring what he had set aside for the Lord's work. The Christians in 
Jerusalem were suffering from poverty and famine...

There are people today too who are suffering from poverty to the
point where they can not buy enough food or clothing for themselves.

Our churches should seek out the needs of people in our community
and on the mission field and be ready to support them in anyway we can.

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that You would give me a compassionate 
heart that I might not think only of myself but of the needs of others...Amen.

Keep looking up, and you will always have the SON in your eyes...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
