04/21/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ You cannot win if you do not begin... (2 Cor. 8:11)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul's says, "We are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are
being saved and to those who are preaching...

To the one we are the smell of death; to the other, the fragrance of life.
And who is equal to such a task?" (2 Cor. 2:15, 16) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

When Christians preach the Good News, it is good news to some and
repulsive news to others. Believers recognize the life-giving fragrance 
of the message. But to non-believers it smells foul, like death ~ their own...

Paul says, "Who is adequate" for the task of representing Christ? Well
our adequacy is always from God (1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 3:5). He has already
commissioned and sent us (Mt. 28:18-20)...

He has given us His Holy Spirit to enable us to speak with Christ's power.
He keeps His eyes on us, protecting us as we realize that God has equipped
us, we can over come our feelings of inadequacy...

In our serving Christ it requires that we focus on what He can do through
us, not on what we can't do by ourselves...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Forgive me when I doubt my capabilities,
Because You have told us that all things are possible with You.
So I pray Dear Father that You would turn my doubts into faith,
that I may realize that I can do all things in You...Amen.

Keep looking up, with Him not job is to great...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
