"Push" and "Pull" (Pro. 13:4)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Paul says, "If anyone has cause grief, he has not so much grieved me as he 
has grieved all of you, to some extent--not to put it too severely...

The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient for him...

Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will no be over-
whelmed by excessive sorrow...

I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him. The reason I wrote to you
was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything...

If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him, and what I have forgiven, if there was 
anything to forgive, I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake...
(2 Cor. 2:5-10) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul explains that it was time to forgive the man who had been punished
by the church and had evidently repented. Now he needed forgiveness, 
acceptance, and comfort...

Satan would gain an advantage if they permanently separated this man 
from the congregation rather than forgiving and restoring him...

Church discipline should seek restoration. There are two mistakes the church
often makes: being too lenient and not correcting mistakes ~ or being too
harsh and not forgiving the sinner...

There is a time to confront and a time to comfort...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, when the need arises to discipline a fellow
believer, help me to do so with a humble heart...Amen.

Keep looking up, and the Son will be in your eyes...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
