Thank U G-pa



A little long but worth reading and so true... Isn't she sweet?


WHEN YOU THOUGHT I WASN'T LOOKING


A message every adult should read because children 
are watching you and doing as you do, not as you say. 


When you thought I wasn't looking I saw you hang my 
first painting on the refrigerator, and I immediately 
wanted to paint another one. 


When you thought I wasn't looking I saw you feed a 
stray cat, and I learned that it was good to be kind 
to animals. 


When you thought I wasn't looking I saw you make my 
favorite cake for me, and I learned that the little 
things can be the special things in life. 


When you thought I wasn't looking I heard you say a 
prayer, and I knew that there is a God I could always 
talk to, and I learned to trust in Him. 


When you thought I wasn't looking I saw you make a 
meal and take it to a friend who was sick, and I 
learned that we all have to help take care of each 
other. 


When you thought I wasn't looking, I saw w you give of 
your time and money to help people who had nothing, 
and I learned that those who have something should 
give to those who don't. 


When you thought I wasn't looking I saw you take care 
of our house and everyone in it, and I learned we have 
to take care of what we are given. 


When you thought I wasn't looking I saw how you 
handled your responsibilities, even when you didn' t 
feel good, and I learned that I would have to be 
responsible when I grow up. 


When you thought I wasn't looking I saw tears come 
from your eyes, and I learned that sometimes things 
hurt, but it's all right to cry. 


When you thought I wasn't looking I saw that you 
cared, and I wanted to be everything that I could be. 


When you thought I wasn't looking I learned most of 
life's lessons that I need to know to be a good and 
productive person when I grow up. 


When you thought I wasn't looking I looked at you and 
wanted to say,'Thanks for all the things I saw when 
you thought I wasn't looking.' 


I AM SENDING THIS TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE I KNOW
WHO DO SO MUCH FOR OTHERS, 
BUT THINK THAT NO ONE EVER SEES.
LITTLE EYES SEE A LOT. 


Each of us (parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, teacher, friend) 
influences the life of a child. 

How will you touch the life of so many today? Just by 
sending this to someone else, you will probably make 
them at least think about their influence on others. 
Live simply. Love generously. Care deeply. Speak 
kindly. 


Leave the rest to God.
