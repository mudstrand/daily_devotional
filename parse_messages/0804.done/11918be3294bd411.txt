04/ 04/08 ~~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ The trouble with the guy who talks to fast is that he
often says something he hasn't thought of yet...(Eccl. 5:2)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the
mortal with immortality, the saying that is written will come true:
"Death has been swallowed up in victory."

"Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?"

The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law...(I Cor. 15:54-56) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Satan seemed to be victorious in the Garden of Eden (Gen. 3) and at the cross
of Jesus. But God turned Satan's apparent victory into defeat when Jesus rose
from the dead (Col. 2:15); (Heb. 2:14, 15)...

So, death is no longer a source of dread and fear. Christ overcame it, and one
day we will too...

The law will no longer make sinners out of us just because we cannot keep it.
Death has been defeated, and we have hope beyond the grave...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for paving the way to eternal
life. I thank You that all who believe in the finished work of Christ
no longer have to dread or fear death. I pray that a revival would 
come to world and that love for all man-kind would reign supreme...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is returning the way He left...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
