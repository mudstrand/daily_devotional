Subject: FW: Time For GOD




















Marlene Taravella














Read only if you have time for God 
Let me tell you, make sure you read all the way to the bottom. I almost deleted this email but I was blessed when I got to the end 











God, when I received this e-mail, I thought...



I don't have time for this... And, this is really inappropriate during work. 













Then, I realized that this kind of thinking is.... Exactly, what has caused lot of the problems in our world today. 













We try to keep God in church on Sunday morning... 













Maybe, Sunday night... 













And, the unlikely event of a midweek service. 













We do like to have Him around during sickness.... 













And, of course, at funerals. 













However, we don't have time, or room, for Him during work or play... 













Because.. That's the part of our lives we think... We can, and should, handle on our own. 













May God forgive me for ever thinking... 













That... There is a time or place where.. 













HE is not to be FIRST in my life. 













We should always have time to remember all HE has done for us. 













If, You aren't ashamed to do this... 













Please follow the directions. 













Jesus said, 'If you are ashamed of me, I will be ashamed of you before my Father.' 










Not ashamed? 










Pass this on ONLY IF YOU MEAN IT!! 










Yes, I do Love God. 










HE is my source of existence and Savior. 










He keeps me functioning each and every day. Without Him, I will be nothing. But, with Christ, HE strengthens me. (Phil 4:13) 





This is the simplest test. 










If You Love God... And, are not ashamed of all the marvelous things HE has done for you... 










Send this to ten people and the person who sent it to you! 




Now do you have the time to pass it on? 










Make sure that you scroll through to the end. 










Easy vs. Hard 










Why is it so hard to tell the truth but Yet so easy to tell a lie? 










Why are we so sleepy in church but Right when the sermon is over we suddenly wake up? 










Why is it so easy to delete a Godly e-mail, but yet we forward all of the nasty ones? 










Of all the free gifts we may receive, Prayer is the very best one.... 










There are no costs, but wonderful rewards... GOD BLESS! 










Notes: Isn't it funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world's going to hell. 










Isn't it funny how someone can say 'I believe in God' but still follow Satan (who, by the way, also 'believes' in God). 










Isn't it funny how you can send a thousand jokes through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing? 










Isn't it funny how when you go to forward this message, you will not send it to many on your address list because you're not sure what they believe, or what they will think of you for sending it to them 










Isn't it funny how I can be more worried about what other people think of me than what God thinks of me. 










I pray, for everyone who sends this to their entire address book, they will be blessed by God in a way special for them. 











And send it back to the person who sent it, to let them know that indeed it was sent out to many more
