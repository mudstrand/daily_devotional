04/14/08 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ No one ever said on their deathbed: I wish I would
have spent more time at work...( Eccl. 2:18; Col.3:23)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

On Him we have set our hope that He will continue to deliver us,

as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our
behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of
many...(2 Cor. 1:10b, 11) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul request prayer for himself and his companions as they
traveled to spread God's message...

Always remember to pray for pastors, teachers, missionaries,
and others who are spreading the Good News...

Satan is always challenging anyone making a real difference
for God...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear heavenly Father, help me to always remember those who
are doing Your work ~ I pray that You would protect them from 
the wiles of Satan. Give them wisdom ~ And give them a sensitivity 
to Your Holy Spirit's presence...Amen.

Keep Looking up, and you will always have the Son in your eyes...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
