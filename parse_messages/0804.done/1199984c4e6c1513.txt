Subject: Jury Duty Scam


Jury Duty Scam DO NOT DELETE WITHOUT READING ! 

This has been verified by the FBI (their link is also included below).
Please pass this on to everyone in your email address book. It is spreading
fast so be prepared should you get this call. Most of us take those
summonses for jury duty seriously, but enough people skip o ut on their
civic duty, that a new and ominous kind of fraud has surfaced. 

The caller claims to be a jury coordinator. If you protest that you never
received a summons for jury duty, the scammer asks you for your Social
Security number and date of birth so he or she can verify the information
and cancel the arrest warrant. Give out any of this information and bingo;
your identity was just stolen. 

The fraud has been reported so far in 11 states, including Oklahoma ,
Illinois , and Colorado . This (swindle) is particularly insidious because
they use intimidation over the phone to try to bully people into giving
information by pretending they are with the court system. The FBI and the
federal court system have ised nationwide alerts on their web sites, warning
consumers about the fraud.
