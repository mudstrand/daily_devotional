09/10/08~~~(food for thought)~~~It isn't your position that makes you happy
or unhappy, it's your disposition...(I Tim. 6:6, 7)

Our Bible Verse for Today:

In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins,
in accordance with the riches of God's grace

That He lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding...(Eph. 1:7-8) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

God showered His kindness on us ~ that is called God's "grace". This is
His voluntary and loving favor given to those He saves...

We can't earn salvation, nor do we deserve it. No religious, intellectual, or 
moral effort can gain it, because it comes only from God's mercy and love...

Without God's grace, no person can be saved. To receive it, we must acknowledge 
that we cannot save ourselves, that only God can save us, and that our only
way to receive this loving favor is through faith in Christ....

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You again today for Your love
and mercy, for without it I would be lost for all eternity. Help
me remove myself from the busyness of each day to look
up and give You thanks...Amen.

Keep looking up ~ that's all He asks...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
