Our Bible Verses for Today:

In Him we were also chosen, having been predestined according
to the plan of Him who works out everything in conformity with the
purpose of His will,

in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, might be for
the praise of His glory...(Eph. 1:11, 12) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

It has, and always will be, God's purpose to offer salvation to the world, 
which He planned since the beginning of time. God is sovereign, He is
in charge...

Oh so often our lives seem to become chaotic, but we can always rest
in this truth: Jesus is Lord, and God is in control. God's purpose to save 
you cannot be thwarted, no matter what evil Satan may bring...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You that no matter how chaotic
my life may seem, I still have this one abiding truth ~ "You are 
Lord, and still in control." I pray that today I would remain 
obedient to Your leading, so that there would be some order 
to my life...Amen.

Keep looking up, you can not go wrong if you follow Him...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
