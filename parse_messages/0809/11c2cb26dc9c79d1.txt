Our Bible Verse for Today:

Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,
to the saints in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus.
(Eph. 1:1) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

"Faithful followers of Christ Jesus" ~ What an excellent reputation!
Such a label would be an honor for any believer...

What would it take for others to characterize you as a faithful follower 
of Christ? 

We need to hold fast to our faith one day at a time: faithfully obeying 
God, in every detail of our lives...

Then, like the Ephesians, we will be known as a person who is faithful 
to the Lord...

Our Prayer for Today:
Help me to be sensitive to Your leading, that I may be characterized 
as a faithful follower. Help me to trust in You for every detail of my
life...Amen.

Keep looking up, all things are possible 
if we only believe...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
