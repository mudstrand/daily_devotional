are to cars...(Pro. 17:22)

Our Bible Verse for Today:

For He chose us in Him before the creation of the world
to be holy and blameless in His sight...(Eph. 1:4) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul says that God "chose us" this is to emphasize that salvation
depends totally on God. We are not saved because we deserve
it but because God is gracious and freely gives salvation...

We did not influence God's decision to save us, He save us 
according to His plan. SO, there is no way to take credit for our
salvation or to allow room for pride...

The mystery of salvation originated in the timeless mind of God
long before we existed. It is hard to understand how God could
accept us...

BUT because of Christ, we are holy and blameless in His sight.
Yes, God chose us, and when we belong to Him through Jesus
Christ, God looks at us as if we had never sinned...

All we can do is express our thanks for His wonderful love...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I could say thanks every day for
the wonderful gift of salvation, but it would never suffice
for this wonderful gift, and Your wonderful love. Help me 
to be better witness of Your grace and mercy...Amen.

Keep looking up, be an example of His love...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
