04/03?2011~~~food for thought~~~LET US NOT OVER-ESTIMATE OUR GOODNESS

Today's Verse:
The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, 
their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good." - Psalm 14:1 

Today's Lesson:
The true atheist is either foolish or wicked ~ foolish because he 
ignores that God exists ~ or wicked because he refuses to live by 
God's truths. . .

The truth of the matter is we all become atheists in practice when we
rely more on ourselves than on God. ~ The fool mentioned here is
someone who is aggressively perverse in his actions. . .

To speak in direct defiance of God is utterly foolish according to
the Bible. . .

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, when we despair because of the world's increasing
hostility or indifference to You, help us also to see the greatness of 
Your love and grace. . . Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through Me." ~ John: 14:6
