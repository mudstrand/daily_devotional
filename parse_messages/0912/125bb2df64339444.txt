12/23/09~~~food for thought~~~CHRISTMAS AT ITS BEST MEANS THE ENTHRONEMENT
OF JESUS CHRIST IN THE HUMAN HEART.

Our Bible Verse for Today:
We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you may 
have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and
with His Son, Jesus Christ...(I Jn. 1:3)

Our Lesson for Today:
The word fellowship is a big one in the New Testament. It comes from a root
meaning "to have things in common." Listen to what John is telling us, He says:
through the Christ Child, I can have back what Adam and Eve once had with God... 

They shared in all His blessings. They walked with Him in all His ways. For them 
life was a perpetual heaven because it was a perfect relationship with God... 

There is only one way back to such a blessed fellowship with the Father.
Only one way for sinners like me to stand next to God.
Only one way to look at Him and see Him smiling at me.
Only one way to stretch out my hand and have Him fill it with blessing after blessing.
Only one way for me to close my eyes for the last time and open them in heaven.
Through the baby in the Bethlehem manger and the Christ on the Calvary cross!

He came to earth:
He took on my flesh.
He became my brother, to make me His brother in God's family.
He came to seek and save a lost family.
He came to pay for my sins and plunged Himself into my hell so that 
I could again be one with my Father...

Prayer Suggestion:
Thank You, Lord Jesus, for restoring the fellowship
I now enjoy with the Father...Amen.
