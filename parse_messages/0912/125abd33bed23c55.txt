That's the group I'm working under. It's the only hope for our nation. 

A tiny cell group known by the name [Bin Prayin] we invite you in.

YOU Bin Prayin" ??? 



Terrorist Groups Operating in Churches 


Latest news reports are that five terrorist cell groups have been operating in many of our churches. They have been identified as: Bin Sleepin, Bin Arguin, Bin Fightin, Bin Complainin, and Bin Missin. Their leader, Osama Bin Lucifer, trained these groups to destroy the Body of Christ. The plan is to come into the church disguised as Christians and to work within the church to discourage, disrupt, and destroy.

However, there have been reports of a sixth group. A tiny cell known by the name Bin Prayin is actually the only effective counter terrorism force in the church. Unlike other terrorist cells, the Bin Prayin team does not blend in with whoever and whatever comes along.


Bin Prayin does whatever is needed to uplift and encourage the Body of Christ. We have noticed that the Bin Prayin cell group has different characteristics than the others. They have Bin Watchin, Bin Waitin, Bin Fastin, and Bin Longin for their Master, Jesus Christ to return.


Which cell group do you belong to?


And guess what, no church is exempt. However, you can spot them if you "bin lookin". Bin Prayin???


No, then you better get busy, cuz our country needs all the prayers you can pack in a day, not just when you are in church.


I "bin lookin"

YOU Bin Prayin" ???
