12/30/09~~~food for thought~~~YET ANOTHER NAME OF LOVE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
And He will be called ~ Prince of peace...(Isa. 9:6f)

Our Lesson for Today:
Wouldn't it be great if one morning when we turned on the TV that the headlines
were, "No War Anywhere in the World Today"?

When Isaiah calls the Christ Child the "Prince of Peace." he has more in mind than
world peace ~ He means more than the peace that would result if no nation anywhere
had any nuclear weapons of chemical bombs...

If every one of us choked off his selfishness and loved his neighbor as himself ~ if
everyone practiced the Golden Rule, doing unto others as he wanted them to do to him...
Such earthly peace would come about more if more people in this world were filled
with Jesus' real peace. The heavenly Prince of Peace came to bring the peace that
results when the war between God and man, cause by sin, is over...

He came to prepare the peace that floods the heart when man knows God is his dear
friend, not his dreaded Foe. He came to make possible the peace that assures the dying 
that heaven is their beautiful home, that their inevitable destination is not hell...

Yes I agree Jesus' peace surpasses all understanding ~ It enables me to live in my tense
world ~ It sustains me in moments of sorrow ~ It equips me to face eternity unafraid ~ Yes
I still need outward peace on this earth, but even more soI need the kind the Christ Child 
prepared with His manger and cross...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, fill my heart with the peace that comes
only through your payment for my sins...Amen
