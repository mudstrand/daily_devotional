12/08/09~~~food for thought~~~AND NOW FOR THE REST OF THE STORY...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"The Messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come,"
says the Lord Almighty...(Mal 3:1b)

Somewhere I saw a painting of the nativity. Angels gathered round
the Christ Child's manger with their songs of praise. But over in the 
corner one angel, holding a small cross it its hand, was wiping a tear
from its eyes. What a reminder! God Himself came to the manger
to go to the cross...

That's what Malachi tells us. When he calls Jesus the "Messenger of 
the covenant," he refers to the beautiful one-sided agreement that God
made with sinners already in the Garden of Eden...

There God Promised to our fallen parents that He would send His Son 
as the seed of the woman to crush Satan's head. Malachi says with
obvious joy, "The Messenger of the covenant [the promised Savior] 
will come."

This blessed season we can echo the prophets words but change 
the tense. "The Savior has come," By God's grace I can even add
as I kneel at His manger bed, "The Savior came for me." For me He 
left heaven's throne. For me He took on human flesh. To save me He
lived and died...

If that wonderful news doesn't fill me with joy, I might as well tear the 
December pages of the calendar or at least cancel the month's last week.
Jesus my Savior, is coming again. that's why I celebrate Christmas...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to sing with joy, "Joy to the world the Lord, 
my Savior, has come..." Amen.
