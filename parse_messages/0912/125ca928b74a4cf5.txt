12/26/09~~~food for thought~~~CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS EVERY DAY...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby,
who was lying in the manger...(Lk. 2:16)

Our Lesson for Today:
Shepherds came to kneel at Jesus' manger bed. These were people
who held one of the more menial jobs in life hurried to worship the
newborn Savior. That comforts me ~ by bring the shepherds, God is 
reminding us that whatever our station in life, we have a Savior...

From the moment of His birth, Jesus was ready to receive all sinners.
That baby was born to save me...

Mary and Joseph were there at Jesus' bed. From the little Scripture 
records about these two, we can learn something important about our faith.
They didn't hesitate but took God at His word, even when His words seemed 
impossible. God help me to do the same, especially with His promise of
salvation..

Yes Jesus was laid in a manger, never before or again will the world see a
baby like Him. ~ Only He was from all eternity ~ Only His birth was foretold
centuries before ~ Only He was virgin born ~ Only at His birth did angels sing ~ 
Only He was born to die for His fellowman ~ Only He deserves our worship...

Prayer Suggestion:
God, help me celebrate Christmas every day...Amen.

Ps.
Since God appeared in a manger, should we be 
surprised to find Him everywhere?
