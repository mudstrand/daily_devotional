12/09/09~~~food for thought~~~THE PURIFIER IS COMING...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
But who can endure the day of His coming? Who can stand when He 
appears? For He will be like a refiner's fire or a launderer's soap. (Mal. 3:2)

Our Lesson for Today:
I love working with old ~ OLD tractors, but at the end of the day my hands
are black and greasy. but I have a special soap which takes it all away...

"A launderer's soap," Malachi called the coming Savior. The word means 
strong stuff like I have in my shop. Like that soap, the coming Christ would
scrub human hearts clean from the impossible-to-remove grease of sin...

"A refiner's fire," Malachi also said. Like a super-hot smelter, the coming of
Christ would melt sin's impurities from precious human hearts. Hearts that the 
Savior has purified need not be afraid. They can stand holy when He returns
in judgment...

BUT hearts that reject the Christ will burn like the fire under the smelting furnace 
or like the lye eating away at the grease. Because of their unbelief, they will carry
their sins into hell's everlasting pain...

Who came for me at Christmas? Thank God I can answer, "Jesus, my purifier 
from sin." Because of Jesus I can say: "I am not what I ought to be. I am not what 
I wish to be. I am not what I hope to be. BUT by the grace of God I am not what I was."

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, and Savior, wash me clean from sin's grease
and power me for the fight against sin...Amen.
