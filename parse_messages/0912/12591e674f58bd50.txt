12/15/09~~~food for thought~~~THE HEAVENLY GUEST IS AT THE DOOR ~
WHO IS HE?

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Praise to the Lord. the God of Israel, because He has come and
has redeemed His people...as He said through His holy prophets
of long ago. (Lk. 1:68, 70)

Our Lesson for Today:
Zechariah, holding the baby John on his lap, didn't say, "Who cares?"
He saw in the heavenly guest the one promised by God through His
prophets. Centuries of waiting were almost over. In six months the
Savior would come...

No wonder Zechariah under the Spirit's guidance sang for joy. He saw 
even more. The Christ Child would be God Himself come to redeem 
His people. He would stand at the door as the eternal God come in
the flesh. Just think of it! God the Almighty ~ a little baby! God the
eternal ~ a few hours old! God the all-ruling ~ rocked in a mothers arms...

How do we describe this miracle of the ages except to point to the over-
whelming love behind it? Remember the first line of that song? it goes,
"The happy Christmas comes once more, the heavenly guest is at
the door." Yes God Himself has come from heaven to be our Savior.
That's reason enough to rejoice...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, fill my Christmas with happiness by
reminding me how You came to save me...Amen
