12/22/09~~~food for thought~~~CHRISTMAS BEGAN IN THE HEART OF GOD. IT IS 
COMPLETE ONLY WHEN IT REACHES THE HEART OF MAN...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and 
we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the 
Father and has appeared to us...( 1 Jn. 1:2)

Our Lesson for Today:
An old legend tell how at midnight on Christmas Eve all the animals pause
wherever they are and kneel. In this way they honor the Son of God, who 
once used their manger for His cradle...

As we pause to kneel this Holy Season, let us TRULY remember why...

Sometime I wish I could see Jesus as John did. Then I remember that its
not the physical but the spiritual closeness of Jesus that counts...

Through the Word, the Holy Spirit gives me eyes to see and a heart to believe 
in the incarnate Word of life. With His gift of faith, I see in the manger the eternal
God who came to bring me eternal life. That's why I kneel before Him...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, I thank You for faith's sight. Help me to kneel
in humble awe before Your gift of life. (Jesus Christ)...Amen.

It is Christmas in the heart that 
puts Christmas in the air...
