12/31/09~~~food for thought~~~GOD'S MERCIES ARE AS OLD AS ETERNITY
AND YET THEY ARE NEW EVERY MORNING.

Our Bible Verse for Today:
You know with all your heart and soul that not one of the good promises the
Lord your God gave you has failed. Every promise has been fulfilled...(Jos. 23:14)

Our Lesson for Today:
What do you see when you look back at the highway of this past year?
You know what I see? I see so many of my thoughts, words and deeds
lying in the ditch like so much litter...

How can I pick back up the trash of my words with which I've hurt people,
not to mention my Savior? ~ How can I pay the fine for littering the road of 
life with my sinful words and deeds? Oh how I've blown another year...

From the look back, I can only look up. ~ What do I see when I raise faith's 
eyes to Jesus, who is the same yesterday, today, and forever? ~ Wasn't He
there each time I came with the penitent plea, "God be merciful to me a sinner"?
Wasn't He there in His Word and Holy Supper to assure me: "Your sins are 
forgiven. Go in peace"? ~ Isn't He here today at the end of another year too one
last time repeat His sweet promises to me? ~ Hasn't He kept His promises
also for the lesser needs of my body? ~ Wont He continue to make all things
work together for my good?

That's right ~ not one of His good promises has failed. ~ That's why I comfortably
close out the old year and confidently enter the new one...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, thanks for all Your mercies this past year.
Please walk with me into the new one...Amen.

REMEMBER: New Year's Day is but a milepost on the way to eternity!
