12/18/09~~~food for thought~~~REJOICE IN THE LORD!

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say again: Rejoice! (Phil. 4:4)

Our Lesson for Today:
Rejoice? Isn't that what the Christmas season is all about?
What a shame it only comes once a year...

Paul wasn't thinking about people or presents when he encouraged believers
at Philippi, "to rejoice always." How could he have been? The apostle was
imprisoned at Rome, jailed unjustly for the crime of talking about his Savior.

Oh he knew what the usual exit from a Roman jail was ~ a head lost to the 
executioner's axe. Yet he urged his fellow believers, "Rejoice always."

"In the Lord," he reminded them. Here my friends is the key for joy that lasts 
from one Christmas to the next. As Paul put it, "You know the grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for our sakes He became poor, 
so that you through His poverty might become rich." (2 Cor. 8:9). And then he
added, "Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift." (2 Cor. 9:15)...

As believers we have a joy that never ends because we have a God whose
grace is unending. In Jesus He gave us the best gift He had, the Savior from 
sin in whom we can rejoice every day of our life...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, thank You for the gift of Your Son as my Savior.
Fill me with joy because of Him...Amen.
