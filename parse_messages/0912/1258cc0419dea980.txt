12?14/09~~~food for thought~~~CHRISTMAS ACCEPTANCE

Our Bible Verse for Today:
"I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered. "May it
be to me as you have said." (Lk. 1:38).

Our Lesson for Today:
In 11 more days, Christmas will be here. In 12, Christmas will be past.
Is that how it will go this year? Or will Christmas last all year? From Mary
we can gain the answer...

The angel's holy presence first filled Mary with fear. The angel's awesome
message filled her with questions. With both fear and questions erased, 
Mary had only one reaction. In simple faith she said, "I am the Lord's
servant. May it be to me as you have said." As God's humble servant 
she was willing to follow His commands. She found joy in doing what her
servant-God asked of her...

When will Christmas end for you? The answer is obvious. Jesus wants to 
be our Savior throughout our life. He wants to serve us with His forgiveness
all our days. He wants to take us to heaven on our final day. So we should
want to serve Him all our days...

So our question should be, "What can I do for You, Lord Jesus, who has done
so much for me?" Willing obedience is the best gift we can give God during
our lifelong Christmas...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, wrap my thoughts and my life around Jesus 
all the days of my life...Amen.
