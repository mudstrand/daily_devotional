12/03/09~~~food for thought~~~HAVE I GOT GOOD NEWS FOR YOU!!!

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Comfort, comfort my people, says your God. Speak tenderly to
Jerusalem, and proclaim to her that her hard service has been
completed, that her sin has been paid for, that she has received
from the Lord's hand double for all her sins...(Isa. 40:1, 2)

Our lesson for Today:
Yes, Isaiah had "good news" for Israel who was living in captivity.
God was going to end her separation from the homeland of Canaan.
Better still, He was going to end her separation from Him. Sin
separates people from God...

It builds a wall no sinner can crawl under, crash through, or climb over.
Only the Holy God, from whom sin separates us, can break down that wall.

Isaiah was to speak of "double" payment, so completely were her sins
gone. We might ask, "How?" Isaiah in many other verses told of the coming
virgin's Son. Of the Lamb going silently to the slaughter. Of the One on 
whom all sins were laid and by whom all sins were paid.

Better news than this Israel would never hear, Nor will we. This Advent season
it's time to kneel a little closer to Jesus' crib and beneath His cross. There we 
will hear the best news ever of how God sent Jesus to bring double payment for
all our sins...

Prayer Suggestion:
Lord, open my heart to receive anew the God News of sins
forgiven through Jesus...Amen.
