11/13/09~~~food for thought~~~CHRISTMAS AMAZEMENT...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"How will this be," Mary answered, "since I am a virgin?" The angel answered,
"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will over-
shadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God." (Lk. 1:34, 35)

Our Lesson for Today:
Mary knew biology. She knew it took two people to conceive a baby.
She also knew that she was still a virgin. In amazement she had to ask,
"How will this be?" the angels answer must have taken her breath away.
The Holy Spirit would miraculously begin Jesus' human life in her womb...

The virgin birth of Jesus, though disputed by some, is a very important
teaching. It reminds us that Jesus was "the Holy One" as the angel told Mary.
If you add a human father to Jesus' conception you would eliminate Him as 
the Savior...

From a human father and mother, Jesus would have inherited the same
sinful heart that we did. Also, the virgin birth should remind us that it was 
totally God's work. Man had no part in it. How could man bring about the 
incredible miracle of God's infinite love taking the infinite shape of true man?

Such a love-packed miracle can only be God's great doing...
Yes Christmas means amazement ~ Joy beyond measure 
because of God's love-powered miracles for us...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me sing loudly of Your amazing love
and what it has done for me in Jesus...Amen.
