11/12/09~~~food for thought~~~CHRISTMAS ANXIETY...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Mary was greatly troubled at his words...but the angel said to her, 
"Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God." (Lk. 1:29, 30)

Our Lesson for Today:
Yes Mary was the first one to have Christmas anxiety! Yes, Mary was afraid. 
But put yourself in her shoes and you will see why. In her day people looked 
down on unwed pregnant women. Also, what about her fianc√© Joseph? 
How would she ever explain it to him?

And that holy angel! Sinful people just simply cannot stand in the presence of
the holy God. They can't even stand with heads erect before one of God's angels.

"Do not be afraid, Mary,' the angel told her, "you have found favor with God."
God's favor flows from His grace. Yes this unexplainable pregnancy was the
reason for anxiety ~ BUT Jesus was the answer to Mary's Christmas anxiety
and can be ours too...

Any anxiety in your heart this Advent? The Savior in the manger won't mean much 
to you if you don't reexamine the reason for His coming. We really need to look past
the veneer we paste over our life and into our heart. The sight isn't pretty. We can no 
more kneel before Jesus' manger than Mary could stand before the angel. But God
has favored us too...

He sent His Son to remove our sins with His payment. He sent Jesus so we could stand
without anxiety before Him this blessed Christmas season...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord remove the fear from my sinful heart.
Fill it with joy because of my Savior's birth...Amen.
