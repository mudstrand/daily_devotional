12/16/09~~~food for thought~~~THE HEAVENLY GUEST IS AT THE DOOR
WHAT DOES HE BRING?

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because He has come and 
has redeemed His people. He has raised up a horn of salvation for us 
in the house of His Servant David, to shine on those living in darkness 
and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace."
(Lk. 1:68, 69, 79)

Our Lesson for Today:
Can you imagine the joy if, when Christmas comes, people everywhere
would reevaluate the gifts the Heavenly guest brings in His arms?

Zechariah sang of those gifts. "He has raised up a horn of salvation," he said.
Like so much garbage, Jesus tossed aside, sin ~ death ~ and the devil forever.
Victory over all three are the gifts the Savior brings...

Like the rising sun, Zechariah said, "Jesus came to shine on those living in darkness
and in the shadow of death." More than a child afraid of the night's darkness, I had
to be terrified of sin's blackness. Yes I was scared of death's darkness. No light ~
no hope ~ no joy ~ no heaven ~ no nothing ~ without the Savior at the door this
blessed season...

Does salvation's light seem as bright as ever? If not, it's time to go back to square 
one, to ask ourselves: "Am I a sinner? How much, not how little, Have I sinned?
Where do I deserve to go because of my sins? What would death be like without
Jesus? Then perhaps we'll be ready to sing with joy, "The happy Christmas comes
once more, the Heavenly Guest with His precious gifts is at the door...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, and blessed Savior, let Your salvation light
up my Christmas and my heart with joy...Amen
