12/02/09~~~food for thought~~~A SURE THING...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Look at the fig tree and all the trees. When they sprout leaves,
you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near.
Even so, when you see these things happening, you know
that the kingdom of God is near. (Lk. 21:29-31)

Our Lesson for Today:
Do you know what a "sure thing" is? Jesus had just finished speaking of the 
signs that would precede His coming. Signs in nature like floods and earthquakes.
Signs in society like wars and rumors of wars. Signs in the church like love for
the Word growing cold and false Christ's arising...

All these signs, He says, will occur before His return. All these signs, we might say, 
tell us that His coming is a sure thing... It's going to happen...

Have we become so wrapped up in the signs that we have forgotten the reason
for them? Have we become so wrapped up in our day to day activities that we
haven't even noticed what is happening in nature, in society and even the church???

Yes all these things (signs) are happening, the signs themselves aren't that important ~ 
BUT Who they point to is, which is the King of course. He wants each of us to be a part 
of His Kingdom of grace...

He wants His gospel to make us His very own. When He does, we are ready for His 
sure return. Then we can even pray for it to happen...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, this Advent season let the signs point my
heart heavenward to Your return...Amen.
