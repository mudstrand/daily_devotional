12/19/09~~~food for thought~~~SEEK THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD!

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near...(Phil. 4:5)

Our Lesson for Today:
How big is Christmas to you? Is it just sharing a greeting, sending a card?
What are your thoughts this time of the year? Is it what will I get from others?
What I gave them last year cost more than what they gave me?

Such thinking exhibits not a spirit of gentle concern for others but selfish 
concerns for self. Such thoughts rob one of the Christmas joy. an even 
greater robber of joy is preoccupation with oneself because of ones sins.

Yes, of course, we need to be concerned about our failures. BUT, knowing 
the Lord is near means we bring those sins to Him in repentance. We need
to trust His Word that He has plunged them into the depths of His forgiveness.

I'm thrilled that in His gentleness He does not deal with me as I deserve but 
forgives me for the sake of His Son. Just as God in His gentle love sent His
Son to wash away my sins, so I'm to respond with gentleness toward my
fellowman. God's gentleness in Christ is contagious. When we have it, we
spread it to others...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to be like Jesus ~ meek ~ lowly ~
loving ~ mild...Amen.
