12/05/09~~~food for thought~~~WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THE GOOD NEWS?

Our Bible Verses for Today:
In that day you will sing: "Praise the Lord! He was angry with me,
but now He comforts me. See God has come to comfort me. I
will trust in Him and not be afraid. The Lord God is my strength
and my song; He has become my salvation." (Isa. 12:1, 2)

Our Lesson for Today:
If you read all six verses of chapter 12 you will notice its all a hymn
of praise. What is the praise about? It is a description of the people's 
joy when Jesus Christ comes to reign over the earth...

Even now we need to express our gratitude to God, thanking Him, and 
telling others about Him. YES from the depths of our gratitude, we need
to be praising Him. AND we should share the Good News with others...
The Good News of how God turned His anger away and sent His Son to
be our salvation, that is truly a reason for joy...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord help me to share the joy of my salvation...Amen.
