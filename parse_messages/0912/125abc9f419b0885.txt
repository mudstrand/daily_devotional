12/20/09~~~food for thought~~~RELAX ~ IN THE LORD...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition,
with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God,
which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds
in Christ Jesus. (Phil. 4:6, 7)

Our Lesson for Today:
"Don't be anxious about anything," Paul said. I think we've all said, "Easier
said than done." Who doesn't have cares, even in this joyous season? The
experts tell us that during a holiday season like this, cares seem even greater...

All around us we hear "Merry Christmas," BUT often our lives are far from merry.
Have you ever thought, that God is unconcerned about your cares? That's not 
the remedy Paul offers. "Present your requests to God," he says...

God knows and cares and wants to do something about our cares. So He gently 
invites us, His children: "Tell me all about it. there is no fear I cannot remove. No
burden I cannot help you carry. No broken heart I cannot heal. No tear so bitter
I cannot wipe away. No sin, regardless how repeated, I have not forgiven."

Paul reminds us to bring our cares to the Lord, "With Thanksgiving." Complaints
are out of order. Can He who gave us the Savior withhold what we need in the 
changing scenes of life???

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me carry everything to You in prayer
with the confidence that is mine in Jesus...Amen.
