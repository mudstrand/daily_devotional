01/01/10~~~food for thought~~~MORE OF THE SAME

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Jesus is the same yesterday and today and forever...(Heb. 13:8)

Our Lesson for Today:
More of the same ~ that's what life seems to be for many of us.
Oh yes, some may have new experiences and excitement this new year, but
life for many of us will be one day strung behind the other with the same tasks
hovering over us and the same troubles settling on our shoulders. It doesn't
make much difference what number we write for the year...

But let us thank God one thing never changes:
Would we want a Lord who changes His mind and issues a recall for promises He made yesterday?
Would we want, a Lord who forgets His full payment for all our sins and now demands that we cover sin's debt?
Would we want, a Lord who closes the door to heaven on a whim that He once opened with His resurrection?

More of the same! That's what we need and that's what we have in our Savior Jesus, 
who is the same yesterday and today and forever...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord Jesus, fill our lives each day of this new year
with more of Your unchanging love...Amen. 

Have nothing to do with that which will not bear the test of time.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
