12/06.09~~~food for thought~~~LET'S JOIN THE CAROLERS...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Give thanks to the Lord, call on His name; make known among
the nations what He has done, and proclaim that His name is
exalted...(Isa. 12:4)

Our Lesson for Today:
"Give thanks to the Lord," Isaiah says. Even if we sound like a bullfrog 
in some pond, we should sing to the One who gave us the newborn King.
We should also use our life to thank the great Giver of Christmas...

"Make known among the nations what He has done," Isaiah also urged.
One sure way to increase Christmas joy is to share it. Not only should we 
join the carolers at Christmastime in singing "We Wish You a Merry Christmas."
We should use every opportunity each day to help bring to others the Good News
of the Savior sent by God's love...

I want them to have the same merry CHRISTmas I do, shouldn't you?
A merry Christmas? Yes, when we rejoice in Jesus our Savior and share
Him with others...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to sing loudly all year through...Amen.

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
