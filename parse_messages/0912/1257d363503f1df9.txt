12/11?09~~~food for thought~~~WHAT WOULD HE PREACH?

Our Bible Verses for Today:
John came...preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins...
After me will come one more powerful than I...He will baptize you with the Holy 
Spirit...(Mk. 1:4, 7, 8)

Our Lesson for Today:
What if John the Baptist came to be the guest speaker in your church?
What would he preach about???

I'm sure he would have something to say about repentance. That means he would 
talk about my sins. Some seem they would rather ignore sin, putting a blindfold
over the eyes of their conscience. They'd rather alibi for sin, pointing to others
who are worse. They'd rather sugarcoat sin, dusting it with sweet phrases like,
"cultural change."

But John would preach sin to me in plain terms. And I had better listen. If the Savior
in the manger is going to mean anything to me, and you, we need to know how much 
we need Him...

With even more gusto John would preach about the Savior. In his day he pointed hears 
all the way ahead to Christ's finished work. John saw Jesus, with His work of salvation 
finished, ascending back to heaven. He saw the ascended Savior sending His Holy Spirit 
to bring people to faith. He saw the Savior returning to judge the world...

What would he preach to us if he filled the pulpit of our churches today?
Above all, he'd say: "Remember the Savior who went to the cross and then
back to heaven. Remember how His salvation is complete. Remember how 
he's coming again to take you to heaven."

Let us pray that our pastors will preach John's sermon to us this Advent...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, remind me of my sins each day so that
I may rejoice on the day Jesus comes for me...Amen.
