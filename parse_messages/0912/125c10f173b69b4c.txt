12/24/09~~~food for thought~~~WHAT IF JESUS HAD NEVER BEEN BORN?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you;
He is Christ the Lord...(Lk. 2:11)

Our Lesson for Today:
Take a moment for this thought, If Jesus had never been born, there'd
be no salvation. 

Then Adam and Eve would still be crying, not only at Eden's door but in hell. 
Then the thief on the cross would have no answer to his plea for just a corner in paradise.
Then Paul would still be the chief of sinners.
Then you and I would be along with all sinners most miserable and sure only of punishment
in a never-ending hell...

If Jesus had never been born, I wouldn't be going to any services this
Christmas Eve. Nor tomorrow or ever, because what would I have to sing 
to hear about, to rejoice about? There would be no message of hope for 
my eager ears to hear...

Its bad enough to celebrate Christmas separated from loved ones.
But just think if there were no Jesus and no promise of eternal life.
There's a thought to make even the angels weep...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me sing tonight, "I am so glad when Christmas
comes, the night of Jesus' birth." Amen.

Lets keep Christ alive in our Christmas celebrations!!!

Let us look over our Christmas giving list. Let us be honest,
will the best gift we give be to Him whose birthday it is?
