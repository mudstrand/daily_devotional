12/28/09~~~food for thought~~~TRULY SEEING HIM...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
And He will be called...Mighty God. (Isa. 9:6b)

Our Lesson for Today:
When we look at the baby in the manger, one may fail to see Him as the might God...
One may say, "that's God who is to be my Rock and my fortress?"
"Why, a rock could so easily crush him in his helplessness."
One may say, "That's God who is my shield and my defender?"
"He himself must be defended from harm and shielded from the cold by His mother's arms."

I would answer, "Yes my friend, that baby will become the Horn of our salvation,
the Mighty God who with His power will toss our enemies of sin and death into the air."
Let's see Him for who He truly is...

That baby is the Mighty God who calms storms and heals men.
Even more do we see His might when with His powerful Word He sends the devil packing
in the wilderness. We also see His might when He shouts of sin's payment on the cross,
"It is finished."

Yes, we see His might even more when He leaves His tomb empty and assures us,
"Because I live, you also will live." And yes even more do we see His might when He arms us 
for our daily battle against Satan by giving us the "Sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God."

Yes, when Jesus, our Savior, stands at our side as the Mighty God, victory is always within reach.
With Him we can face any foe...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, be with me as my Mighty God so that I
may have power against all my enemies...Amen.
