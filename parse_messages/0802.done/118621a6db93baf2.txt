Thank you Cs.

a couple of years ago... 







Subject: Fwd: The old preacher







While watching a little TV on Sunday instead of going to church, I watched a Church in Atlanta honoring one of its senior pastors who had been retired many years. He was 92 at that time and I wondered why the Church even bothered to ask the old gentleman to preach at that age. 










After a warm welcome, introduction of this speaker, and as the applause quieted down he rose from his high back chair and walked slowly, with great effort and a sliding gate to the podium. Without a note or written paper of any kind he placed both hands on the pulpit to steady himself and then quietly and slowly he began to speak.... 


"When I was asked to come here today and talk to you, your pastor asked me to tell you what was the greatest lesson ever learned in my 50 odd years of preaching. I thought about it for a few days and boiled it down to just one thing that made the most difference in my life and sustained me through all my trials. The one thing that I could always rely on when tears and heartbreak and pain and fear and sorrow paralyzed me... the only thing that would comfort was this verse......... 




"Jesus loves me this I know. 

For the Bible tells me so. 

Little ones to Him belong, 

we are weak but He is strong..... 

Yes, Jesus loves me... 

The Bible tells me so." 

When he finished, the church was quiet. You actually could hear his foot steps as he shuffled back to his chair. I don't believe I will ever forget it. 

A pastor once stated, "I always noticed that it was the adults who chose the children's hymn 'Jesus Loves Me' (for the children of course) during a hymn sing, and it was the adults who sang the loudest because I could see they knew it the best." 

"Senior version of Jesus Loves Me" 

Here is a new version just for us who have white hair or no hair at all. For us over middle age (or even those almost there) and all you others check out this newest version of Jesus Loves Me. 





JESUS LOVES ME 

Jesus loves me, this I know, 
Though my hair is white as snow 
Though my sight is growing dim, 
Still He bids me trust in Him. 
(CHORUS) 
YES, JESUS LOVES ME.. YES, JESUS LOVES ME.. 
YES, JESUS LOVES ME FOR THE BIBLE TE LLS ME SO. 
Though my steps are oh, so slow, 
With my hand in His I'll go 
On through life, let come what may, 
He'll be there to lead the way. 
(CHORUS) 
When the nights are dark and long, 
In my heart He puts a song. 
Telling me in words so clear, 
"Have no fe ar, for I am near." 
(CHORUS) 
When my work on earth is done, 
And life's victories have been won. 
He will take me home above, 
Then I'll unde rstand His love 
(CHORUS) 
I love Jesus, does He know? 
Have I ever told Him so? 
Jesus loves to hear me say, 
That I love Him every day. 
(CHORUS) 


If you think this is neat, please pass it on to your friends. If you do not pass it on , nothing bad will happen, but you will have missed an opportunity to "Reach out and Touch" a friend or a loved one. 
God Bless Us All !!!
