Today's Verses: Ps. 40:9-10

I have told all your people about your justice. I have not been afraid to
speak out, as you, O Lord, well know.

10 I have not kept the good news of your justice hidden in my heart; I have
talked about your faithfulness and 

saving power. I have told everyone in the great assembly of your unfailing
love and faithfulness. 

Today's Thoughts:

David said he would speak of God's faithfulness and salvation to those
around him.

When we fully realize the impact of God's righteousness on our lives, we
will not be 

able to keep it hidden. We will want to tell other people what God has done
for us.

IF God's faithfulness has changed your life, don't be timid. It is natural
to share a 

good bargain with others or recommend a skillful doctor. So it should also
be natural 

to share what God has done for you. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, teach me the blessedness of knowing Jesus and the
power of 

His love, so that I may find the greatest joy in witnessing to what He is
and has done 

for me. . . Amen
