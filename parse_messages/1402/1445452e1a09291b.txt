Today's Verses: Ps. 40:16-17

16 But may all who search for You be filled with joy and gladness in You.

May those who love Your salvation repeatedly shout, "The Lord is great!"

17 As for me, since I am poor and needy, let the Lord keep me in His
thoughts. 

You are my helper and my savior. O my God, do not delay. 

Today's Thoughts:

We have in verse 16 a common and natural confession that should be on 

the lips of every Christian-"The Lord is great!" 

As saints and sinners, we are unable to keep God's Law perfectly, even
though

He requires that we do so. BUT by the power of His Word and Spirit and by
faith,

He instills in us a new desire-to live more perfectly.

Our Lord Jesus kept the Law perfectly and died on our behalf that we might
live 

with Him in His kingdom.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, help me, that by Your grace I might learn Your commandments more 

completely each and every day. Preserve me I pray, that by Your Holy Spirit

I will never become ungrateful and seek after this world's vanity or other
gods.

Help me to cling truly and solely to You, I pray in Jesus Name. . . Amen.
