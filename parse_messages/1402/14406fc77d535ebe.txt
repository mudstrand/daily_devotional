Today's Verses: Ps. 39:11-12

When you discipline us for our sins, you consume like a moth what is
precious to us. 

Each of us is but a breath. 
12 Hear my prayer, O Lord! Listen to my cries for help! Don't ignore my
tears. 

For I am your guest- a traveler passing through, as my ancestors were before
me. 

Today's Thoughts:

Once again we have a reminder that we should be mindful of our place and 

be submissive before the Almighty God. We should see that God's eternal 

nature is contrasted with our frailty-And that our time is limited and we 

should use it wisely-NOT living for the moment-BUT with our eternal 

home in mind. . .

Today' Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, help me always to offer my thankfulness for

Your grace and mercy each and every day. . . Amen.

He will not turn His face from you if you return to Him." (2 Chron. 30:9)
