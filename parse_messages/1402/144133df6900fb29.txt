Todays Verses: Ps. 39:13

Spare me so I can smile again before I am gone and exist no more.

Today's Thoughts:

By verse 13 it would seem that David was becoming impatient but before 

we make such a judgment call let us read vss.1-3 of chap. 40

Ps. 40:1-3

I waited patiently for the Lord to help me, and he turned to me and heard my
cry.

2 He lifted me out of the pit of despair, out of the mud and the mire. He
set my feet 

on solid ground and steadied me as I walked along.

3 He has given me a new song to sing, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will
see what 

He has done and be amazed. They will put their trust in the Lord. 

Further Thoughts:

Through David's waiting he had become discouraged-it's not always easy
waiting for God's help-

But David received 4 benefits from waiting: 

(1) God lifted him out of despair;

(2) He set his feet on solid ground,

(3) He steadied him as he walked, and

(4) He put a new song of praise in his mouth-

Quiet often blessings cannot be received unless we go through the trial of
waiting.

So let's remember to always pray for patience. . . 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, help me not to become discouraged while waiting on Your timing-

Help me remember that blessings come with patience. . . Amen.
