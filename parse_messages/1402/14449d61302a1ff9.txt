Today's Verses: Ps. 40: 7-8

Then I said, "Look, I have come. As is written about me in the Scriptures:

8 I take joy in doing Your will, my God, for your instructions are written
on my heart." 

Today's Thoughts:

"I take joy in doing Your will, my God." In John 4:34, 5:30 we see that
Jesus

portrayed this attitude of obeying and serving God. He came as the prophets 

foretold, proclaiming the Good News of God's righteousness and forgiveness 

of sins. 

How often have we excused ourselves from doing God's will-(witnessing for
Him)?

Have you ever used the excuse that your family or friends are not ready to
believe?

Well Jesus makes it clear that all around us there is a continual harvest
which waits 

to be harvested.

Don't let Jesus find you making excuses-If you look around you I am sure you
will 

find people ready to hear God's Word.

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that the mind of Christ be in me, to do Your
will 

in all things, that I may finish Your work-in Jesus name Amen.

Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus. (Phil. 2:5)
