Today's Verses: Ps. 40:1-3

I waited patiently for the Lord to help me, and He turned to me and heard
my cry

.2 He lifted me out of the pit of despair, out of the mud and the mire. He
set my feet 

on solid ground and steadied me as I walked along.

3 He has given me a new song to sing, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will
see 

what He has done and be amazed. They will put their trust in the Lord. 

Today's Thoughts:

Waiting for God to help us is not easy-but David received four benefits-

(1) God lifted him out of despair.

(2) God set his feet on solid ground.

(3) God steadied him as he walked, and

(4) God put a new song of praise in his mouth.

Often blessings cannot be received unless we go through the trial of
waiting. 

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

O Lord, keep me attached as a branch to Christ,

Who is the life giving vine. . . Amen.



Pastor Alvin and Marcie Sather

Jesus says: "I am the vine; you are the branches." John 15:5
