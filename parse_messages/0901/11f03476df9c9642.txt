Sat. 24/09~~~food for thought~~~God did not call us to be impure, but
to live a holy life...(1 Thess. 4:7)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Make every effort to live in peace with all men and to be holy;
without holiness no one will see the Lord...(Heb. 12:14)

But now that you have been set free from sin and have become 
slaves to God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the
result is eternal life...(Ro. 6:22)

Our Lesson for Today:

What are your thoughts about God? How far have we drifted from
the thought of His holiness???

I believe we need to recover a sense of awe and a profound 
reverence for God. We need to begin once again to view Him
again in the infinite majesty that alone belongs to Him who is the
Creator and Supreme Ruler of the entire universe...

We seem to have forgotten that there in an infinite gap in worth 
and dignity between God the Creator and man the creature, even
though man has been created in the image of God...

The fear of God should be a heartfelt recognition of this gap,
not a put down of man, but an exaltation of God...

Sometimes I think that we have magnified the love of God almost
to the exclusion of the fear of God. And because of this preoccupation 
we are not honoring God and reverencing Him as we should...

We should be magnifying the love of God, BUT while we revel in His
love and mercy, let us never lose sight of His majesty and His holiness...

Prayer Suggestion:
Let us remember to approach God as a holy and just God.
Let us remember to thank and praise Him for who He really is...
