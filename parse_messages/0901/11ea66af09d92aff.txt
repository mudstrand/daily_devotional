1/04/09 ~~~ (Always be mindful) ~~~ We were created in God's image...

Our Verses for Today:

When God created man, He made him in the 
likeness of God...Gen. 5:1

Yet, O Lord, You are our Father. We are the
clay, You are the potter; we are all the work
of Your hand...Isa. 64:8

Our Lesson for Today:

The question we should ask ourselves today is:
Do I have any joy in serving?

Many people, yes even Christians, live only to make a good 
impression on others or to please themselves. BUT selfishness
brings discord...

Because of this Paul often stressed spiritual unity, asking us to
love one another and to be of one spirit and purpose...

If we remain mindful of the fact that we were all created in the 
likeness of God, we will attempt to work together, caring for the
problems of others as if they were our problems. In doing so we 
will demonstrate Christ's example -- that of putting others first...

In doing so we will experience unity. Let us not be so concerned 
about making a good impression or meeting our own needs that
we strain our relationships in God's family...

Our Prayer for Today:
Pray that you would be less concerned about material things
yes even less concerned about self and more concerned 
about unity in the body of Christ.

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
