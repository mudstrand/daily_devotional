1/08/09 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ Examine your trials - Haven't they made you stronger?

Our Verses for Today:

We also rejoice in our sufferings. because we know
that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance,
character; and character, hope...(Ro. 5:3-4)

Our Lesson for Today:

How do we usually deal with trials in our life? I think it goes without
saying that we prefer things to go smoothly in our life, with the least 
amount of valleys in our life...

But of course we know that is wishful thinking, So let us look at some
of the advantages that the Bible says about having trials...

Lets look at James 1 beginning with verse 2

Dear brothers and sisters, whenever trouble comes your way,
let it be an opportunity for joy...

James doesn't say If trouble comes your way but whenever it does.
James assumes that we will have troubles and that it is possible to
profit from them...

The point here is not to pretend to be happy when we face pain but
to have a positive outlook (Let it be an opportunity for joy)

verse 3, 4 goes on to say:

For when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow.
So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully developed, you will
be strong in character...

We can't fully know the depth of our character until we see how we react
under pressure. It is easy to be kind and loveable towards others when
everything is going well, but can we still be kind when others are treating us
unfairly...

The reason we have trials is that God wants to make us mature and complete,
not to keep us from pain. Instead of complaining about our struggles, we should
see them as opportunities to grow...

Our Prayer should be:
Instead of complaining let us thank God for promising to be with us in rough
times. Ask God to help you solve your problems or to give you strength to
endure them...Then be patient...
