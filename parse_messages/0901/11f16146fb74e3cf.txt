Tue. 7/09~~~food for thought~~~Righteousness guards the man of integrity.
(Pro. 13:6a)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

May integrity and unrighteousness protect me, because my
hope is in You...(Ps. 25:21)

I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and
man...(Acts 24:16)

Our Lesson for Today:

A father has to be careful of his promises, because a real man
will follow through...

A real man is a man of integrity, that means going all out in 
everything he does...

When he says something, you can count on it, take it to the bank.
If I say I'm going to do something, you can consider it done...

The first time I violate that, my credibility is shot...

Our reputations are only as good as our last performance...

Unless the real men of this country, and there aren't many left,
come together and align themselves under God, we're headed
for catastrophe...

God is looking for men who will obey and be what He wants them 
to be...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord make it my ambition to lead a quiet life, to mind my 
own business and to work with my hands. Help me to keep all
my promises to You and to my neighbor...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
