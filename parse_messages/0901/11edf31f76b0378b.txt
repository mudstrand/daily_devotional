1/16/09~~~food for thought~~~With all that He does, God said, 
"I will never leave you nor forsake you."

Our Bible Verses for Today:

God will remain faithful, for He cannot disown Himself... 2 Tim. 2:14

The Lord is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those
who trust in Him... Nahum 1:7

Our Lesson for Today:

What do we do with our failures???

It would be a tragedy if my kids grew up knowing only that their
dad was a good husband and father. If they thought I expected 
them to live every minute of their lives the way they have seen me
live as they grew up, they would be frustrated and devastated if they
failed...

I want them to know what they didn't see, when I failed miserably 
and only came out of it by the grace of God...

As they grow older and able to understand, I'm committed to
being open and honest with them. I want them to know of my
mistakes so they can avoid them. I also want them to know my
mistakes because they will make their own, and I don't want
them to feel they are the first person in the family to fail...

I want to be able to sit with my kids and tell them some of the
things I have done. Not to glorify sin. Not to justify it. Not to
say everybody does it so it must be okay. Instead, because 
I'm not proud of it and because I don't want them to feel unique.

Most of all, I want them to know that by the grace of God, He
brought me through it and out of it, and He can do the same
for them...

Prayer Suggestions:

Pray that God will help you be honest and above board
when your children ask questions about your walk through
life. Pray that you will be able to share not only your victories,
but also your failures. We need to pray for added grace...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
