Thur. 22/09~~~food for thought~~~A friend loves at all times, and a brother
is born for adversity...(Pro. 17:17)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

My intercessor is my friend as my eyes pour out tears
to God...(Job 16:20)

A perverse man stirs up dissension, and a gossip separates 
close friends...(Pro.12:28)

Our Lesson for Today:

One of the best examples of male friendship is found in the book
of I Samuel.. Here we read about real male friendship, about a 
relationship that ran deep between Jonathan, the kings son and
David, a shepherd boy and God's future choice for the throne...

Their friendship was strong, it was built solidly on an inward
attachment rather than on an outer attachment or social status.
these men demonstrated a mutual acceptance of each other
despite their different social backgrounds...

David's interests were more important to Jonathan than his own,
and David felt the same way about Jonathan's interests...

If you take the time to study the friendship between David and
Jonathan, you will come away with a good understanding of what 
a healthy friendship between men can and should have...

Any definition of friendship should have the following:

* Unconditional love
* Personal enjoyment
* Mutual acceptance
* Mutual interests
* Mutual commitment
* Mutual loyalty

What we should recognize here is that, friendship involves a concern
for and involvement with the well-being of another person...

Prayer Suggestion:
We should pray that the definitions laid out above would
become a part of our character...
