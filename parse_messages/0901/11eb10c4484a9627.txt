1/07/09 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ No matter what our status is, we all have 
an obligation to declare God's power to 
the next generation...

Our Verses for Today:

I thought, "age should speak; advanced years should teach wisdom."
But it is the spirit in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that gives him 
understanding...(Job 32:7, 8)

Our Lesson for Today:

I'd like to share with you today what God's Word says about challenges.

Lets look at what Eph. 6:10ff has to say in regards to challenges.

Finally, be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power.
Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your
stand against the devils schemes.

For your struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, 
against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and
against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms...

Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of
evil comes, you maybe able to stand your ground...

How does this relate to our lives today?
First of all let us consider the brevity of our years on earth...

This should cause us to find new motivations to preserve
the values that will endure. Why should we work ourselves 
into an early grave, missing those precious moments with 
loved ones who crave our affection and attention?

It is a question that every man and woman should consider...

Let me leave you with this final word of encouragement for
those who are determined to slow the pace: Once you get 
from under constant pressure, you'll wonder why you drove 
yourself so hard for those years...

I have stood by many death beds and have yet to hear,
"I wish I would have taken on more challenges and spent
less time with friends and family."

Prayer 
We should always ask for a greater sensitivity to God's Spirit
and a greater understanding of God's Word...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
