Mon/19/09~~~food for thought~~~A faithful man will be richly blessed, but one who
is eager to get rich will not go unpunished...
Pro. 28:20

Our Bible Verses for Today:

For the Lord is good and His love endures forever;
His faithfulness continues through all generations...(Ps. 100:5)

Now it is required that those who have been given 
a trust must prove faithful...(1 Cor. 4:2)

Our Lesson for Today:

Biblical friendship calls for faithfulness. Whatever our circumstances
they should not affect our consistency...

In Ro. 12:15 Paul says: we are to "rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn 
with those who mourn."

Faithfulness is critical to a close relationship because we depend on those
who are close to us. Christ's deepest hurts occurred within His circle of
closest companions. David too was wounded emotionally more by the
treachery of his close friends than by the efforts of his enemies (Ps. 55:12-14).

Paul was also left to stand alone when he was deserted by Demas and others
(2 Tim 4:10).

A faithful friend keeps confidences. In Pro. we read that "A perverse man
stirs up dissension, and a gossip separates close friends" (16:28)...

Entering friendship involves revealing yourself in confidence to another,
thus becoming vulnerable. This is the way it should be, but at the same
time it is what makes betrayal so evil and faithfulness so virtuous...

Our Prayer Should be:
Pray that God would bridal your tongue from gossip and unloving words.
Pray that you would always speak the most charitable words about others...
