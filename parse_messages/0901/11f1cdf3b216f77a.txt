Wed. 28/09~~~food for thought~~~Keep on loving each others as brothers...
(Heb. 13:1)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Honor one
another above yourselves...(Ro 12:10)

Hatred stirs up dissension, but love covers over all
wrong...(Pro. 10:12)

Our Lesson for Today:

When Jesus was asked to name the greatest commandment
in the Scriptures, He didn't hesitate in the least. He told the 
young Lawyer, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart 
and with all your soul and with all your mind. Love your 
neighbor as yourself." (Mt. 22:37, 39)

Loving God, Loving others, and finding value in ourselves;
without a doubt, these three aspects of love are the most
effective weapons against the destructive power of low
self-worth...

Genuine love is a gift we give others. It isn't purchased by 
their actions or dependent upon our emotions at the moment...

It may carry with it strong emotional feelings, but it isn't supported
by them. Instead, it is a decision we make on a daily basis that
someone is specail and valuable to us. In fact, love for someone 
often begins to flow once we have made a decision to honor them...

Prayer Suggestion:
Pray for the fruit of the Spirit which is love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, and faithfulness; because 
with these gifts will bloom Christ-likeness
