Sat. 17/09~~~food for thought~~~We live by faith not by sight...(2 Cor. 5:7)

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Consequently, faith come from hearing the message, and
the message is heard through the word of Christ...(Ro. 10:17)

Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be men of courage;
be strong...(1 Cor. 16:13)

Our lesson for Today:

God is perfect and we are not. We are just humans, and he is,
well, God. So how can we relate to Him???

In the message of a pastor friend, he said Jesus is the answer.
He said we could relate to Him because even though He was 
perfect, He had also become a man. He said Jesus was the bridge...

And what this means is He paid for our sins. if we can accept that
and believe in Christ, then we are forgiven and know we are going 
to heaven...

Do you believe in God? Do you believe the Bible is God's message
to man? Do you believe what the Bible says? That all have sinned?
Do you want to become a Christian? If you have answered yes to
this questions, then just pray...

You may be asking: "How does one go about praying?
Remember that God being God knows what's on your mind so, all you
need to do is tell Him...

If you have done that then you can step from skepticism to belief...

Prayer suggestion:
Just have a one to one conversation with God...
You don't need to worry about fancy polished words.
Just be sincere!!!

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
