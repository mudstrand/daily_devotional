Texas Sheriff 
A man seeking to join a south Texas Sheriff's Department is being interviewed.

The Sergeant doing the interview says: 'Your qualifications all look good, but there is an attitude suitability test that you must take before you can be accepted.'

Then, sliding a service pistol across the desk, he says: 'Take this pistol and go out and shoot six illegal aliens, six meth dealers, six Muslim extremists, and a rabbit.'

'Why the rabbit?'

'Great attitude,' says the Sergeant. 'When can you start?'
