1/2/09 ~~~ Food for thought ~~~ Anger management...

Our Verses for Today:

An angry man stirs up dissension, and a hot tempered
one commits sins...

A man's pride brings him low; but a man of lowly spirit
gains honor...(Pro. 29:22-23) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

I don't know if everyone will agree with this, but to me it seems
as though we live in an age of rage...

Now by studying anger and its power, we can learn self-control
so that we do not need to lose our temper in rage or abuse
ourselves with resentment, but can defuse anger by resolving
circumstances...

We need to prayerfully seek how we can incorporate these resolutions
in our own lives:

. To keep my life centered on God, as best I can, recognizing
that when I do not, my natural self will generate things to become
angry about...

. To not condemn myself for feelings of anger...

. To do everything I can to avoid acting on the basis of anger...

. To clean up any problems I create as quickly as possible...

. To redirect the energy of anger away from hurting people and
toward improving conditions for people...

Every person who seeks God's help in the understanding and
resolution of his or her anger will receive that help...

Prayer for Today:
We need to pray for the miracle of God's love in us,
the miracle of His redemptive grace...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
