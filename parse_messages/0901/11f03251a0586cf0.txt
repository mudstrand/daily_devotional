Fri. 23/09~~~food for thought~~~Precious in the sight of the Lord is
the death of a saint...Ps. 116:15

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Christ died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep,
we may live together with Him...(I Thess. 5:10)

Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff,
they will comfort me...(Ps. 23:4)

Our Lesson for Today:

The question today is: How much faith is enough in our mourning?

I think that at one time or another we have all felt, it is more than we have...

Jesus once said that the amount of faith isn't important. If we have faith,
though it be as small as a mustard seed, nothing will be impossible...

I see faith in this instant as basic trust. We don't need a huge amount
of it in order to get on with our bereavement. In fact, if we worry about 
having a lot of faith, we may just miss the mustard seed we do have...

Remember the giver of this grain of faith is God, whose Son maintained
His faith. He went through His Gethsemane of grief with the word "Father"
still on His lips...

We too can go through the valleys and mountains of our bereavement journey
with "Father" on our lips. Oh yes our hearts may wonder, doubt and cry out
in pain, but these feelings will not obliterate our faith. Even when we think we
have lost that mustard seed, we will do well to remember that our Father is
faithful, for He has loved us first..

A Suggestion for Prayer:
Pray for the courage to cling to the Father...
Pray for a sensitivity to realize His presence...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
