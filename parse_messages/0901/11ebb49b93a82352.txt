1/09/09 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ Do not break your oaths, but keep the oaths
you have made to God...Mt. 5:33

Our Verses for Today:

Whoever acknowledges Me before men, I will also acknowledge
him before My Father in heaven...

But whoever disowns Me before men, I will also disown him
before My Father in Heaven... Mt. 10:32, 33

Our Lesson for Today:

We may come on hard times but if we remain committed in our 
Christian walk, God will be there to carry us through the tough 
times...

I would like to share a quote from Reggie White...

"The promises made, but not kept; the functions attended,
but not experienced; the hopes dreamed, but not put into
action -- commitment matters. There is no success for a
football player -- or a Christian -- without it...

Remember without commitment we cannot claim Jn. 14:6

I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the
Father except through Me.

Prayer for Today:
Let our prayers be that we will continue to walk in the Lord's
will...Commitment to the Lord is the answer to eternity with
Him...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
