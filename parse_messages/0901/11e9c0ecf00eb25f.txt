1/03/09 ~~~ (food for thought) ~~~ How to deal with anxiety...

Our Verses for Today:

Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you...
(I Pet 5:7)

Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans
will succeed... (Pro. 16:3)

Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry
about itself... (Mt. 6:34)

Our Lesson for Today:

Paul writes in Philippians "Do not be anxious." In one sense this is
like telling a person with a bad head cold no to sniffle and sneeze.
Or maybe its more like telling a wino to lay off the booze or a compulsive
gambler to stay away from the casino...

Is anxiety a disease or an addicition? Maybe it is something of both.
Partly, perhaps, because you can't help it, and partly because for
some dark reason you choose not to help it...

How often do we torment ourselves with detailed visions of the worst 
that can possibly happen???

Now Paul does not try to minimize the fact that we will have some bad 
things happen to us. He certainly must have suspect that something
bad would soon happen to him...

He does not try to explain them away as God's will or God's judgment 
or God's method of testing our spiritual fiber. He simply tells us that in 
spite of them--even in the thick of them--we are to keep in touch with the
One who transcends the worst things as He also transcends the best...

The best prayer in this case is ~~~ the 23 Psalm

The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
