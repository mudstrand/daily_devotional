Subject: THE LAW IS THE LAW












IN GOD WE TRUST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!




THE LAW IS THE LAW! 

I really love this one 

This is one of the better e-mails I have received in a long time! I hope this makes its way around the USA several times over!!!!! 

So Be It! 




THE LAW IS THE LAW 




So " if " the US government determines that it is against the ! 

law for the words "under God" to be on our money, then, 

so be it. 




And " if " that same government decides that the 

"Ten Commandments" 

are not to be used in or on a 

government installation, then, 

so be it. 




I say, "so be it," because I would like to be a 

law abiding US citizen. &nb sp; 




I say, "so be it," because I would like to think that 

smarter people than I are in positions to make good decisions.. 




I would like to think that those people have the 

American public's best interests at heart. 

BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I'D LIKE? 




Since we can't pray to God, can't Trust in God and cannot post His Commandments in Government buildings , I don't believe the Government and its 

employees should participate in the 

Easter and Christmas 

celebrations which honor the God 

that our government 

is eliminating from many facets of American life. 




I'd like my mail delivered on Christmas, Good Friday, Thanksgiving & Easter. After all, it's just another day. 




I'd like the " US Supreme Court to be in session on Christmas, Good Friday, Thanksgiving & Easter as 

well as Sundays." After all, it's just another day. 




I'd like the Senate and the House of Representatives 

to not have to worry about getting home for the "Christmas Break." After all it's just another day. 




I'm thinking that a lot of my taxpayer dollars could be saved, if all government offices & services would 

work on Christmas, Good Friday & Easter. It shouldn't cost any overtime since those would be just like any other 

day of the week to a government that is trying to be "politically correct." 

In fact.... 




I think that our government should work on Sundays (initially set aside for worshipping God...) be cause, after all, our government says that 

it should be just another day... 

What do you all think???? 




If this idea gets to enough people, maybe our elected 

officials will stop giving in to the "minority opinions" 

and begin, once again, to represent the "majority" 

of ALL of the American people. 

SO BE IT........... 




Please Dear Lord, 

Give us the help needed to keep you in our country! 

'Amen' and 'Amen' 

Touché! 




These are definitely things I never thought about but 

from now on, I will be sure to question those in 

government who support these changes. 




At the top, it says "I hope this makes its way around 

the USA several times over!!!!!" 

Let's see that it does.
