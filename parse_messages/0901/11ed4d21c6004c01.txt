1/14/09~~~(food for thought)~~~How do we deal with "ego" self-importance?

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be men of courage;
be strong. Do everything in love...(I Cor. 16:13, 14)

Now this is what the Lord Almighty says: "Give careful thought 
to your ways." Haggai 1:5

Our Lesson for Today:

I think that we all know many small men! Now I'm not talking about
small in stature--but men who think little, talk little, plan little.

they remind us of eagles staked to the ground, there's no soar to
them. Their ceiling is zero--and their horizons are pulled in to the
hub.

I'm not saying that these men are selfish (some of course are). But
it's just that they are preoccupied most of the time with their own little
area of knowledge...

They don't allow their minds to stretch and breathe. They don't think,
they just rearrange their prejudices. These people are indifferent to
problems other than their own. They have no concern for those things
which do not hold a personal reference. They refuse to be bothered!!!

We live in times which demand big men. Not men who are big shots 
(they're useless), but men who are big in heart and mind. Great men! 
Large-souled men!

We need men with a vision--whose feet are on the ground, but whose
eyes are on the far horizon. Men whose hearts God has touched. Men
committed--dedicated to God and His holy and high purpose! Men of
integrity!

Prayer Suggestions:
Pray for wisdom--Godly wisdom. Pray for a Christ-like
heart. pray for a sensitivity to God's purpose...
Let us also pray for our leaders, that they also will be 
sensitive to God's will...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
