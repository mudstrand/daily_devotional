Our Verse for Today:

"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature:
old things are passed away; behold, all things are become 
new." 2 Cor. 5:17

Our Thought for Today:

Today is a day for erasing the mistakes of the past year
from our minds. Today let us thank God for new beginnings.
Today let us ask his guidance and blessing for the coming 
year...

My prayer is: That you would have a blessed and healthy New Year.

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
