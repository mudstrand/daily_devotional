Fri. 30/09~~~food for thought~~~Be at peace with one another...(Mk. 9:50)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

When man's ways are pleasing to the Lord, He makes even
his enemies live at peace with him...(Pro. 16:7)

Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the
bond of peace...(Eph. 4:3)

Our Lesson for Today:

Someone once described the contrast between a good life and 
a godly life as the difference between the top of the ocean and 
the bottom. On top, sometimes it's like glass -- screen and calm -- 
and other times it's raging and stormy.

But hundreds of fathoms below, it is beautiful and consistent, always
calm, always peaceful...

Life around us in the world can go from one extreme to another, but
if we have Christ deep down in our heart we can have peace...

Prayer Suggestion:
Let us continue to pray that the Holy Spirit would help us in
every effort to do what leads to peace and mutual edification...

Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
