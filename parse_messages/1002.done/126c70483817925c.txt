02/13/2010~~~food for thought~~~WHAT I NEED TO DO, THAT I MAY 
RECEIVE GOD'S FORGIVENESS

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"If you forgive those who sin against you, Your heavenly Father
will forgive you. But if you refuse to forgive others, your Father
will not forgive your sins...(Mt. 6:14, 15)

Our Lesson for Today:
What a startling warning Jesus gives about forgiveness. If we refuse
to forgive others, God will also refuse to forgive us. WHY? Because
when we don't forgive others, we are denying our common ground as
sinners in need of God's forgiveness...

God's forgiveness of sin is not the direct result of our forgiving others,
but it is based on our realizing what forgiveness means (Eph. 4:32). YES
it is easy to ask God for forgiveness but very difficult to grant it to others.
Whenever we ask God to forgive us for sins we have committed, we should
ask, "Have I forgiven the people who have wronged me?

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, give me a forgiving heart so that I might
receive Your forgiveness...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
