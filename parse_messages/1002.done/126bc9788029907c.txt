02/11/2010~~~food for thought~~~GROWING IN OUR VALLEYS

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Peter and the others were very drowsy and had fallen asleep. Now they 
woke up and saw Jesus' glory and the two other men standing with Him.
As Moses and Elijah were starting to leave, Peter, not even knowing what
he was saying, blurted out, "Master, this is wonderful! We will make three 
shrines ~ one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."

Our Lesson for Today:
"Master this is wonderful!" Peter James and John experienced a 
wonderful moment on the mountain and didn't want to leave.

Sometimes we too have such an inspiring experience that we want to stay
where we are, away from the reality and problems of our daily life. Knowing
that struggles await us in the valley encourages us to want to linger on the
mountaintop. 

BUT staying on top of the mountain prohibits our ministering to others. 
Thus instead of becoming spiritual giants we would soon become 
dwarfed by our self-centeredness.

Yes we do need times of retreat and renewal, BUT only so we can return to minister
to the world. Our faith must make sense off the mountain as well as on it...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord I do thank You for the mountain top experiences,
but I also pray that You would help me to see that I need the
valley experiences, that I may grow in my faith...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
