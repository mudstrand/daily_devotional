Our Bible Verse for Today:
Jesus took the twelve aside and told them, "We are going up to Jerusalem, 
and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be
fulfilled." (Lk. 18:31)

Our Lesson for Today:
Here are some of the predictions of what would happen to Jesus:
Ps. 41:9 (the betrayal) ~ Isa. 53:4-7 (crucifixion) ~ Ps. 16:10 (resurrection)

The disciples had all these predictions, yet they didn't understand Jesus, apparently 
because they were more focused on what He said about His death and ignored what 
He said about His resurrection...Even though Jesus spoke plainly, they would not OR 
could not grasp the significance of His words UNTIL they saw the risen Christ face to 
face.

Even though we have the New Testament which tells us "The wages of sin is death,
but the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ or Lord." (Ro. 6:23), many
ignore the "wages part" but expect the "free gift" part...

Yes we are free to choose between two masters, (sin or Christ Jesus) it is either one 
or the other. You can not serve both...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me each day to serve Christ so that
I might receive Your free gift of eternal life...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
