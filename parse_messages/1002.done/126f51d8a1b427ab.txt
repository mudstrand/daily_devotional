02/22/2010~~~food for thought~~~WHY DON'T YOU BELIEVE???

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Jesus speaking ~ Can any of you prove Me guilty of sin? If I am
telling the truth, why don't you believe Me? (Jn. 8:46)

Our Lesson for Today:
Who can we believe these days? We've learned to take the words of the
salesman, the politician, and others with a "grain of salt." the more they urge
us, "Believe me," the more we back away. Thank God, there is one Person 
we can believe - totally. What He says, we can trust - completely...

Why do we need a sinless Jesus? ~ Because a sinless Jesus is one who 
never speaks a lie or stretches the truth. When He says He will never leave us 
or forsake us, we can take it as gospel truth. When He says our sins are plunged
into the depths of the sea, that promise also stands sure as the heavens above.
When He says He will walk with us through the shadow, He's going to be there. 

Jesus says, "Believe Me." ~ How foolish not to!!!

Prayer Suggestion:
Yes, Lord, I believe, by Your grace and the Spirit's working.
Help me to always do so...Amen.
Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
