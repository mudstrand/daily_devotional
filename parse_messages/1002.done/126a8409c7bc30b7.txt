02/07/2010~~~food for thought~~~"CAN'T YOU SEE HIM?"

Our Bible Verses for Today:
"No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived,
what God has prepared for those who love Him" ~ but God has
revealed it to us by His Spirit...(I Cor. 2:9, 10)

Our Lesson for Today:
People can try to tell us about the Savior. Preachers can try to point us to Him.
But when they ask, "Can't you see Him?" our answer can only be "No." Yes! 
Such is our horrible legacy from our first parent's sin in the Garden of Eden.
In our natural spiritual condition, God's wisdom of salvation in Christ is only
foolishness...

Until, THAT IS, God reveals His blessed truth to us by the Spirit. The Holy Spirit 
brings the Savior up close to us through the gospel. With the Word He not only 
points out Jesus but works to power faith within our unbelieving hearts. Not only 
does He ask, "Can't you see Him?" He also creates faith in us to know and trust 
Jesus as our only Savior. When the Holy Spirit does His work, I can see Jesus. 
And that's the most precious sight in the world...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord I thank You for Your Holy Spirit's power
to open my eyes to see and my heart to trust Jesus
as my Savior...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
