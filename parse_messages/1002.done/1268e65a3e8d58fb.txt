02/03/2010~~~food for thought~~~BUILT BY GOD...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's building...(I Cor. 3:9)

Our Lesson for Today:
Much to often we look at a building with a beautiful steeple and call
it the church, BUT God's church is not some stately building. The 
church is comprised of all believers in Christ...

Its construction began in the Garden of Eden when God proclaimed 
the promise of a Savior. The Holy Spirit has been its general contractor
throughout the years. His construction equipment has been the gospel in 
Word and sacrament...

Through the good-news of forgiveness, He works in the hearts of people.
He brings them in faith and mortars them as living stones into God's eternal
church...

"Built by God" is not just some abstract theological truth. Its my comfort.
Thank God for His work in my heart. What a gift of His grace that I am a
part of His church...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, may the Spirit keep me mortared
in Your church through the Gospel...Amen.

Pastor Alvin & Marcie Sather
The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can to the Father except by Me...Jn. 14:6
