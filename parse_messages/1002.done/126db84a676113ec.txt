02/17/2010~~~food for thought~~~BY FAITH WE ELIMINATE THE "IFS" IN LIFE...

Our Bible Verses for Today:
Then the devil took Him (Jesus) to the holy city and had Him stand
on the highest point of the temple. "If you are the Son of God," he
said, "throw Yourself down..." Jesus answered him, "It is written:
do not put the Lord your God to the test." (Mt. 4:5-7)

Our Lesson for Today:
"Try God out," Satan urged Christ with yet another temptation. Here we see again
that little "if" "If you are the Son of God, throw Yourself down." And then he even
quoted from Psalm 91 about how God has promised to protect His own...

Watch out when the prince of darkness masquerades as an angel of light. God
is to be trusted, not tested. His promises are to be humbly believed. In such
cases what are we to do? There is only one thing to do, Look to Jesus. "It is written," 
He answered, sending Satan flying with the cutting edge of God's almighty Word...

If we would swing the sword of the Spirit at Satan, he has to duck. When we train
to fight with God's Almighty Word, Satan has to slink in defeat...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, train me in Your Word so that I am armed for battle...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
