03/01/2010~~~food for thought~~~WERE YOU THERE?

Our Bible Verse for Today:
He was delivered over to death for our sins...(Ro. 4:25)

Our Lesson for Today:
Were you there? "Yes," we answer gladly on some occasions. BUT
not so gladly if it's an unpleasant situation. HOW ABOUT when asked
"Were you there when they crucified my Lord?"

Do we always pick up on the little pronoun in our verse? "Our sins,"
Paul said. ~ Oh how quick we pick up on the sins of others in Christ's
death. ~ Like the hatred of the Jewish leaders, ~ the cowardice of 
Pilate, ~ Judas' greed, ~ and the disciples' faintheartedness...

BUT what we see so easily in others seems to remain unseen in ourselves.
BUT Paul has set the record straight with that pronoun "our." ~ My
shortcomings, which no paint can cover up regardless how thick I apply
it, were part of the Calvary equation...

YES soldiers swung the hammer, but my sins pierced Him. Hell chained
Him in its torments, but my sins forged some of the links. There when they
crucified my Lord? Thank God, my happy answer can be "Yes" there seeing 
and believing what God's love did with all my sins...

Prayer Suggestion:
Thank You, Lord, for being there a Calvary as the only
one who could pay for my sins...Amen.

No one can come to The Father except through me." - John: 14:6
