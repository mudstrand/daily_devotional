02/02/2010~~~food for thought~~~THE GREATEST DELETE KEY...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
The blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from all sin... (I Jn. 1:7)

Our Lesson for Today:
It used to be we'd reach for the bottle of "white out," bush it on our mistakes,
and then type over them. Next came the erasing ribbon that lifted the type
from the page so we could make our corrections. Now we have the computer
with its delete key. How far we've come!!!

Now sin is not just some "typo" on the page of life that we can correct. Each
thought, word, and deed that goes astray offends God and earns us death.
whiting out sin in our memories won't work. Regardless of what we try, the
point remains to trouble us. Typing over sin with our own works won't do it
either. Those efforts only smudge our sins, leaving them clearly visible to the
divine judge. Even if we had some delete key for our sins, they'd still be in the
computer trash file, damning us before God...

There is only one way for sin to be erased. In fact, it's already been done.
At Calvary when His Son said, "It is finished," God hit the delete key on His 
heavenly computer. His Son's precious blood paid for every sin of every sinner...

Yes the sins were totally erased...

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to appreciate Jesus'
precious blood...Amen.

No one can come to the father except through me." - John: 14:6
