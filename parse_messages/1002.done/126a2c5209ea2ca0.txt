Our Bible Verse for Today:
There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ...(Ro. 8:1)

Our Lesson for Today:
Every pastor has been asked and had to answer one particular question.
Many Christians on a sickbed or in trouble have thought or said it. "God
must be punishing me for my sin," Yes this has been the comment or,
should we say the question. A troubled Christian needs an answer...

We need to listen closer to Paul's words! "There is now no condemnation,"
Write in the word punishment for condemnation, and you can see what he 
has in mind. There is no more punishment for me, no more sin that the
righteous judge is singling out for which to hit me with. Can that be so?
"Yes," Paul says, "For those who are in Christ Jesus."

Yes Christ Jesus has paid for all our sins, they are totally and completely 
gone. Because the Spirit has brought me to faith in Jesus I am wholly holy
in God's eyes, cleansed from sin's every stain clothed with Jesus' robe of 
righteousness...

Yes God has already charged Jesus for your sin and accepted the payment 
rendered. So how can He be charging us again for it???

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, fill my heart with the peace that comes from
knowing Jesus has paid for all my sins...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
