02/12/2010~~~food for thought~~~GRACE SAYS IT ALL

Our Bible Verses for Today:
For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith ~ and this
not from yourselves, it is the gift of God ~ not by works, so that
no one can boast...(Eph. 2:8, 9)

Our Lesson for Today:
Do I understand that people are carried to heaven not because of what 
they do or don't do but because of God's generosity? ~ Do I appreciate
that people enter God's heaven purely through His grace? ~ Grace is
the rich word for some gift completely undeserved, something I in no
way have coming...

Why should God send His Son to rescue me from an eternity in hell that 
I so richly deserve? ~ Why should He single me out of the sea of humanity 
to hear the news of His Salvation? ~ Why should He struggle with my rebellious
heart and bring me to faith in Jesus as my only Savior? ~ WHY? WHY? WHY?

Grace is the only word that fits ~ it really is! It is as our Bible verse today says:
"By grace you have been saved ~ through faith ~ it is the gift of God ~ 
not by works ~ so that no one can boast." Our faith is not even something
we can boast about it too is a gift...

Prayer Suggestion:
Thank You Lord, for Your love, mercy, and grace that saved
a wretch like me...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
