02/19/2010~~~food for thought~~~A QUIET SPIRIT LISTENS TO JESUS...

Our Bible Verse for Today:
Martha came to Jesus and said, "Lord, doesn't it seem unfair to You that
my sister just sits here while I do all the work? But the Lord said to her, 
"My dear Martha, you are so upset over all these details! There is really 
only one thing worth being concerned about. Mary has discovered it ~ 
and I won't take it away from her." (Lk. 10: 40, 41, 42)

Our Lesson for Today:
Martha didn't realize that in her desire to serve, she was actually neglecting
her guest. Are you so busy doing things for Jesus that you're not spending
any time with Him? Don't let your service become self serving...

Jesus did not blame Martha for being concerned about household chores.
He was only asking her to set priorities. It is possible for service to Christ
to degenerate into mere busywork that is totally devoid of devotion to God...
(Phil. 3:13, 14; Ps. 27:4)

Prayer Suggestion:
Dear Lord, help me to not let my desire to serve 
become self serving...Amen.

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
No one can come to the Father except through me." - John: 14:6
