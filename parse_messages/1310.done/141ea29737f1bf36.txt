Today's Verses: Ps. 19:1-2

The heavens proclaim the glory of God. The skies display his craftsmanship.

2 Day after day they continue to speak; night after night they make him
known.

Today's thoughts:

It goes without saying that we are surround by God's craftsmanship. 

The heavens give dramatic evidence of His existence-His power-His love-His
care.

To say that the universe happened by chance is absured.



As you look at God's handiwork in nature and the heavens-thank Him for such
magnificent 

beauty and the truth it reveals about the creator. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for all the evidence we have of Your
power, love, 

and existence. I thank You for the beauty of Your creation, in Jesus name. .
. Amen.
