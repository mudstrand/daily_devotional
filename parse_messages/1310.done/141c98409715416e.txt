Today's Verses: Ps. 18:1-3

I love you, Lord; you are my strength.2 The Lord is my rock, my fortress,
and my Savior; my God is 

my rock, in whom I find protection. He is my shield, the power that saves
me, and my place of safety.

3 I called on the Lord, who is worthy of praise, and he saved me from my
enemies. 

Today's Thoughts:

The protect that God affords His people is limitless-and it can take many
forms.

David characterized God's care with five military symbols. God is like:

(1) A rock that can not be moved by any who would harm us.

(2) A fortress or place of safety where the enemy cannot follow.

(3) A shield that comes between us and harm.

(4) Strength of salvation, a symbol of might and power.

(5) A stronghold far above our enemies. . .



David praises God for His glorious works and blessings through the years.

If you need protection, look to God.

Seek true peace-not in earth, but in heaven;

not in men, nor in any other creature, but in

God alone. (Thomas /a Kemps)

May the God of peace Himself give you peace at all

Times and in every way. 2 Thess. 3:13 NIV
