I have no problem sending this to EVERYONE. Please consider doing the same,

Did you notice whom Obama threatened when he wasn't getting his way on
raising the debt ceiling? 



He threatened not to pay:

Social Security Retirees

Military Retirees

Social Security

Disability

Federal Retirees.





Now let this sink in really well...

He did not threaten to stop payments to illegal aliens.

He did not threaten to take frivolous benefits such as Internet access away
from violent inmates.


He did not offer to fire some of the thousands of unnecessary federal
employees that he hired.

He did not offer to cut down on his or his wife's frivolous gallivanting
around--- $20 Million already spent on family vacations. (One Million on a
Flordia golf outing). All our money...why not?

He didn't threaten farm subsidies.

He did not threaten not to pay the senators and representatives or any
oftheir staff.

He did not threaten to take benefits away from welfare recipients or to stop
the free cell phones they get.

He did not threaten the food stamp programs.

He did not threaten to reduce payments in foreign aid.


He did not threaten to cut back on anything that involves his base voters.

The list could go on and on. He is in full political mode!

Why are we allowing this person to destroy this wonderful country with his
selfishness and his lies? Have WE lost our blooming minds!!!!!!! !His type
of change is killing our country. He needs to be stopped. Do not forget
about his tactics when it's election time 2014. Get out and Vote in the
mid-term election - 2014. Support the people in the House and Senate that
are willing to cut taxes and spending. Let's make 2014 - the beginning of a
turn-around. Forget change. We want our $$$$$$$$$ back and we want to take
our country back!

We the people are coming.



Only 86% will send this on. Should be 100%. What will you do?


ONE FLAG, ONE LANGUAGE, ONE NATION UNDER GOD!


IN GOD WE TRUST
