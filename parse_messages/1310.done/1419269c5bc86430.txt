Today's Verse: Psalms 16:10-11 

For you will not leave my soul among the dead or allow your holy one to rot
in the grave.

11 You will show me the way of life, granting me the joy of your presence
and the pleasures of living with you forever. 

Today's Thoughts:

We see here that David is confident that God would not leave him in the
grave.

Many people fear death because they cannot control or understand it. As
believers, 

we can be assured that God will not forget us when we die. He will bring us
to life 

again to live with Him forever. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, help me appreciate every day, Your many blessings. 

Let me count them one by one with a grateful heart. May I at no 

time forget Your benefits when the desire of my heart has not 

yet been granted. Thank You for the promise of the resurrection. . . Amen.

A righteous man is cautious in friendship-Pro. 12:26 NIV



Character is so largely affected by associations that we cannot-

afford to be indifferent as to who and what are friends are.

(M. Hulburd)
