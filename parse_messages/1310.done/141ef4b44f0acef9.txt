Today's Verses: Ps. 19:7-9

7 The instructions of the Lord are perfect, reviving the soul. The decrees
of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple.

8 The commandments of the Lord are right, bringing joy to the heart. The
commands of the Lord are clear, giving insight for living.

9 Reverence for the Lord is pure, lasting forever. The laws of the Lord are
true; 

Today's Thoughts:

How often have we thought of the law as something that keeps us from having
fun?

Oh excuse me-I guess that was when we were young and foolish!



In these verses we see just the opposite: God's law revives us-makes us
wise-brings 

joy to our heart-gives insight-warns us-and rewards us. God's laws are
guidelines and 

lights our path, rather than chains on our hands and feet. They point at
danger to warn us, 

then points at success to guide us. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, bless me each day with Your presence and 

guide and direct me this coming week. Amen.
