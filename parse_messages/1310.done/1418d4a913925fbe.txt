Today's Verse: Psalms 16:9 

No wonder my heart is glad, and I rejoice. My body rests in safety. 

Today's Thoughts:

David Had found the secret to joy-True joy is far deeper then happiness;

we can feel joy in spite of our deepest troubles-Happiness is temporary

because it is based on external circumstances, but joy is lasting because

it is based on God within us. . .



As we consider His daily presence, we will find contentment-As we understand

the future He has for us, we will experience joy-

Don't base your life on circumstances, but on God. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Heavenly Father, Your goodness has opened Your hands to supply all my

Needs-and Your love has protected me from harm-But You have also opened

Your heart and drawn me closer to Yourself with Your forgiving mercies,

Truly, You are wonderful. . .In Jesus name.Amen.

Let us do good to all people. Gal. 5:10 NIV



All that is necessary for evil to triumph

is for good people to do nothing.

(Edmund Burke)
