Today's Verse: Ps. 19:14

14 May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing to
you, 

O Lord, my rock and my redeemer. 

Today's Thoughts:

Would you change the way you live IF you knew that every word and thought
would 

be examined by God first? David asks that God approve his words and
thoughts as 

if they were offerings brought to the altar. 



As you begin each day, determine that God's love will guide what you say and
how you think. . .

Today's Prayer Suggestion:

Dear Lord, create in me a clear heart so that my words and deeds would be
pleasing to You.

Continue to be with me and all Your people until journey's end, most
gracious Savior and Lord. Amen.

Who is a God like You, who pardons sin and

forgives the transgressions. . . Micah 7:18 NIV
