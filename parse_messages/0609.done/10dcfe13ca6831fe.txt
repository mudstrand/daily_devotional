GOOD MORNING!!!...(food for thought)...The Fellow who does things that count
doesn't usually stop to count them...(Phil. 4:13, 14)

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus says: "I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know
his master's business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I
learned from My Father I have made known to you." (Jn. 15:15) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

Because Jesus is Lord and Master, He should call us servants, instead, He calls us friends.

How comforting and reassuring to be chosen as Christ's friends...Because He is Lord and 
Master, we owe Him our unqualified obedience, but most of all, Jesus asks us to obey Him 
because we love Him...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, how comforting it is to know that you consider me
to be Your friend...I thank You for Your love O Lord...I pray that my love for 
you would shine in all that I do...Amen.

Keep looking up, for I feel the Lord has a blessing for you today...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather

I just want to say thanks from my brother for all
your prayers...He had 5 by-passes done and has 
even surprised the nurses and doctors as to all
that he is able to do within 24 hrs.

God bless you all!!!
