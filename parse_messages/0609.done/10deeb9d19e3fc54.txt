Good Morning!!!...(food for thought)...Take care of your character and your
reputation will take care of itself...(I Tim 4:8)

Our Meditation for Today:

Jesus says, "All this I have told you so you won't go astray...They will put
you out of the synagogue, in fact a time is coming when anyone who kills
you will think he is offering a service to God...(Jn. 16:1,2) NIV

Our Thought for Today:

In Jesus last moments with His disciple he warns them, (1) about further persecution.
(2) He told them where, when. and why He was going away. (3) He assured them that 
they would not be left alone, but the Spirit would come...

Jesus knew what lay ahead, and He did not want the disciples' faith shaken or destroyed.

God wants you to know that you are not alone. You have the Holy Spirit to comfort you,
teach you truth, and help you...

Our Prayer for Today:

Dear Heavenly Father, What You said about persecution is now taking place
not only in places like Iraq and other countries, but we also see You being
put out of our schools, and other public places...I pray that once again You 
would be accepted everywhere...And that a revival in this country would take
place...Amen.

Keep looking up, He wants to speak with you...
You're in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather...
