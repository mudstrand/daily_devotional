08/14/08~~~(food for thought)~~~Those who deserve love the least
need it the most...(Mt. 5:44)

Our Bible Verse for Today:

The entire law is summed up in a single command:
"Love your neighbor as yourself."

If you keep on biting and devouring each other, watch out
or you will be destroyed by each other...(Gal. 5:14, 15) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

When we are not motivated by love, we become critical of others.
We stop looking for the good in them and see only their faults.
soon the unity of believers is broken...

Have you talked about someone behind their back? Have you been
focusing on the shortcomings of others instead of their strengths?

You need to remind yourself of Jesus' commandment to love others
as you love yourself (Mt. 22:39)...

When you begin to feel critical of someone, make a list of the person's
positive qualities. If there are problems that need to be addressed, it
is better to confront in love than to gossip...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, help me to be more tender hearted.
Help me to speak in the most charitable way about my neighbor.
Help me to always remember Your commandment, to love
others as I love myself...Amen.

Keep looking up, in love...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
