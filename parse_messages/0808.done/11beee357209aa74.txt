08/23/08~~~(food for thought)~~~Take care of your character and your reputation
will take care of itself...(I Tim 4:8)

Our Bible Verse for Today:

Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying one another.
(Gal 5:26).

Our Lesson for Today:

Everyone needs a certain amount of approval from others.
But those who go out of there way to secure honors or to 
win popularity with a lot of people become conceited and 
show that they are not following the Holy Sprit's leading...

Those who look to God for approval won't need to envy 
others. Because we are God's sons and daughters. 
We have His Holy Spirit as the loving guarantee of His
approval...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your love and concern for
me. I thank You that Your Son took my place on the cross paying
my debt for my sins...Amen.

Keep looking up, believing in His Son...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
