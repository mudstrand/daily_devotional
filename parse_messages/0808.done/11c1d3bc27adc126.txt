09/01/08~~~(food for thought)~~~The only preparation for tomorrow is
the right use of today...(Mt. 6:34)

Our Bible Verse for Today:

May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the
world...(Gal. 6:14) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

The world is full of enticements. Every day we are confronted
with subtle cultural pressures. The only way to escape these
destructive influences is to ask God to help crucify our interest
in them, just as Paul did...

How much do the interest of this world matter to you?

My suggestion is to read Gal. 2:20 and 5:24 for more on this concept...

Our Prayer for Today;
Dear Heavenly Father, forgive me for the times I have
fallen prey to the influences of the world. Help me to
crucify my interests in them...Amen.

Keep looking up, we can do all things 
through Him who loves us...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
