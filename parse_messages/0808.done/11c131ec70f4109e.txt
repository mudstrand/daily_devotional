08/30/08~~~(food for thought)~~~We can accomplish more in one hour with
God than in one lifetime without Him...(Mt. 19:26a)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying
to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is
to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ...

Not even those who are circumcised obey the law, yet they want 
you to be circumcised that they may boast about your flesh...(Gal. 6:12, 13) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Some of the Judaizers were emphasizing circumcision as proof
of holiness ~ but were ignoring the other Jewish laws...

People today too often choose certain principle or prohibitions and
make them the measure of faith. Some may frown on drunkenness but 
ignore gluttony. Others may despise promiscuity but tolerate prejudice.

The Bible in its entirety is our rule of faith and practice ~ We cannot
pick and choose the mandates we will follow...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to always remember, sin is sin ~
whether the act is tolerable or horrendous, in God's eyes it is still
s-i-n. Help me to examine my own actions before I pass judgement
on others...Amen.

Keep looking up, size up others through God's eyes...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
