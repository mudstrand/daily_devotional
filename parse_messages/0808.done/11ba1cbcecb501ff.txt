08/08/08~~~(food for thought)~~~If you don't want the fruits of sin, stay out
of the devil's orchard...(II Thess. 5:22)

Our Bible Verse for Today:

It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, 
then, and do not let yourself be burdened again by a yoke 
of slavery.,,(Gal. 5:1) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

Christ died to set us free from sin and a long list of laws
and regulations... 

Yes Christ came to set us free ~ but not free to do 
whatever we want because that would lead us right 
back into slavery to our selfish desires...

Yes thanks to Christ, we are now free and able to do
what was impossible to do before ~ to live unselfishly.

Those who appeal to their freedom so that they can have 
their own way or indulge in their own desires are falling
back into the slavery of sin...

But we need to be careful that we do not put the burden of
law keeping on Christians. We must stand against those who 
would enslave us with rules, methods, or special conditions 
for being saved or growing in Christ...

Remember, "We are saved by grace alone ~ through faith alone." 

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for sending Your Son Jesus Christ,
to set me free from my sins. Help me to not use my freedom so as to
become a slave again to sin. Bless my e-mail friends today with good 
health and safety...Amen.

Keep looking up, His grace is sufficient...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
