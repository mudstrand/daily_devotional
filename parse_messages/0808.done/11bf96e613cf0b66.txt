08/25/08~~~(food for thought)~~~the hardest secret for a person to keep is~
his/her opinion of themselves...(Ro. 12:3)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Brothers if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should 
restore him gently. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.

Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of 
Christ.

If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives 
himself...(Gal. 6:1-3) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

No Christian should ever think that he or she is totally independent 
and doesn't need help from others, and no one should feel excused 
from the task of helping others...

The body of Christ ~ the church ~ functions only when the members
work together for the common good. Do you know someone who 
needs help?

Is there a Christian brother or sister who needs correction or 
encouragement? Humbly and gently reach out to that person 
(Jn. 13:33, 35)

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, Help me to be sensitive to the needs of 
others, so that I may humbly reach out and help my sisters and 
brothers in Christ...

And Help me to be humble enough to accept help when I need it. 
Guide me in the way of righteousness I pray in Jesus name...Amen.

Keep looking up, He is there for you...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
