08/29/08~~~(food for thought)~~~The poorest of all men is not the man without
a cent but the man without a dream. (Pro. 29:18a)

Our Bible Verses for Today:

Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time 
we will reap a harvest if we do not give up...

Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people,
especially to those who belong to the family of believers...(Gal. 6:9, 10) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

I believe we have all found it to be discouraging to continue
to do what is right when we receive no words of thanks or see
any tangible results...

But Paul challenged the Galatians, and he challenges us to
keep doing good and trust God for the results. In do time.
we will reap a harvest of blessing...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I love doing good, but patience is not
one of my long suits. So I pray help me to be patient ~ help
me to trust You for the final results of my labors ~ for I know
down deep that You do reward those who are faithful. Help
me to trust in Your timing I pray in Jesus name...Amen.

Keep looking up, God knows what is best...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
Pastor Al & Marcie Sather
