08/15/08~~~(food for thought)~~~Faith is daring the soul to go beyond what
the eyes can see...(2 Cor. 5:7).

Our Bible Verse for Today:

So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires
of the sinful nature...

For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and 
the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature. They are in conflict
with each other, so that you do not do what you want...(Gal 5:16, 17) NIV

Our Lesson for Today:

How can we be certain if our desires are totally pure???

Well if your desires are to have the desires listed in Gal. 5:22, 23
then you know that the Holy Spirit is leading you. BUT at the same 
time, be careful not to confuse your subjective feelings with the 
Spirit's leading...

Being led by the Holy Spirit involves the desire to hear ~ the readiness 
to obey God's Word ~ AND the sensitivity to discern between your 
feelings and His prompting...

Live each day controlled and guided by the Holy Spirit. THEN the words
of Christ will be in your mind ~ the love of Christ will be behind your
actions ~ AND the power of Christ will help you control your selfish desires...

Our Prayer for Today:
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your Holy Spirit's leading, and teaching,
help me to always be sensitive to His presence. Help me to discern between my
feelings and His prompting...Amen.

Keep looking up, and He will give you discernment...
You are in the prayers of two who care...
