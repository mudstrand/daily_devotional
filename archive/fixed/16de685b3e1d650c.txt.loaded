A WORDLESS PRAYER (read Jn. 5:1-15)
===================================================================
verse:

[Jesus] asked him, “Do you want to get well?” (Jn. 5:6)

===================================================================
reflection:

Jesus visited a well-known pool near one of Jerusalem’s
gates. The place was called Bethesda, literally a house of
mercy. When an angel stirred the pool the first one to step
in would be healed. Jesus approached a man who had lain
beside the pool for 38 years and asked if he wanted to get
well. The patient could have answered, “Of course I do, why
do you think I’ve been laying here?” But he answered Jesus,
who was unknown to him, with respect: “Sir … I have no one
to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. The man
had not spoken words of prayer, but Jesus knew the man’s
desire. He said, “Get up . . . and walk” (Jn 5:8).
Immediately the man got up and walked. Sincere prayer may
consist of many words, a few words, or none-at-all. What is
important is He who searches our hearts knows the mind of
the Spirit, who intercedes for the believer in accordance
with God’s will” (Ro. 8:26-27). Our Lord knows what is in
our heart when in faith we come to Him with words or
without.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord Jesus, You see our need even before we speak, and You
know the desires we can’t put into words. Search my heart,
meet me with Your mercy, and speak the healing command that
lifts me to walk in faith. Teach me to trust the Spirit’s
intercession and to come to You—whether with many words,
few, or none at all. Amen. (AI)
