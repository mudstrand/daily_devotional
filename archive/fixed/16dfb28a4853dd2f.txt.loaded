SPIRITUAL GROWTH (read I Pet. 2:1-3)
===================================================================
verse:

Like newborn babies, crave spiritual milk, so that by it you
may grow up in your salvation. (I Pet. 2:2)
===================================================================
reflection:

What Is Needed in This Life: The people the apostle
addressed in his letter were New Christians. Spiritually
speaking they were babies. A good beginning had been made,
but newcomers in the faith need to grow. As we should see
the apostle clearly explained how spiritual growth comes
about. The proper nourishment for beginners is the “pure
spiritual milk,” the simple Word of God. It teaches that all
people are sinners and that Jesus Christ is their only
Savior: and are redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, a
lamb without blemish or defect (I Pet. 1:18-19) Our calling
is to be Christians who daily grow in the knowledge and
faith of Christ.

===================================================================
prayer:

Father, nourish me with the pure spiritual milk of Your
Word, that I may grow daily in the knowledge and faith of
Christ. Keep my heart humble like a newborn, hungry for
truth, and anchor me in the precious redemption won by
Jesus’ spotless blood. Make my beginnings mature into
steadfast obedience and living hope. Amen. (AI)
