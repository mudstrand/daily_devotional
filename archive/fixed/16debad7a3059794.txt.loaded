JESUS COMES OUR WAY (read Mk. 10:46-52)
===================================================================
verse:

As Jesus and His disciple … were leaving the city, a blind
man, Bartimaeus … was sitting by the roadside begging. (Mk.
10:46)
===================================================================
reflection:

Everyone of us, at one time or another, experience some kind
of distress. If it isn’t a physical disability it is
something else: financial worries, health concerns, career
challenges, loneliness, or any number of other challenges.
But there is help and hope. We are greatly blessed to have
Jesus, Helper and Healer, come our way. The Savior, having
made us His own, comes our way on the feet of human
messengers: friends, family, and fellow Christians in whose
hearts the love of God is working. The question before every
Christian should be: How can we be a messenger for Christ to
people in need.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord Jesus, Helper and Healer, meet us in every
distress—body, mind, and spirit—and bring Your comfort and
hope. Fill our hearts with Your love so we become Your
messengers: attentive to needs, swift to pray, generous to
serve, and brave to bear Your gospel. Send us to the lonely,
the worried, and the hurting, that through our hands and
words they may meet You. Amen. (AI)
