USING OUR HINDSIGHT
===================================================================
verse:

For You make me glad by Your deeds, Lord; I sing for joy at
what Your hands have done. (Ps. 92:4) - (read: Ps. 111)

===================================================================
reflection:

I've always thought you can see the hand of God best with
our hindsight. Looking back it is easier to understand why
He placed us in the home that He did; why He brought certain
people and circumstances into and out of our lives. In my
own life, I get a lot of clarity (though not perfect) about
the wise and loving ways of God as I reflect on the ways He
has managed my journey by "What God's have done" (Ps. 92:4).
Looking ahead, though, is not always so clear. Have you ever
had that lost feeling when the road ahead seems twisted,
foggy and scary? Before you move into life's next big
adventure, stop and look into the rear view mirror of days
gone by, and joyfully realize that God meant it when He
said, "Never will I leave you, never will I forsake you." So
we can say with confidence, "The Lord is my helper; I will
not be afraid" (Heb. 13:5-6) With the promise of God's
presence and help in mind, we can move ahead with utmost
confidence.


===================================================================
prayer:

Heavenly Father, thank You for Your steadfast promise that
You will never leave us nor forsake us, giving us strength
and courage as we face uncertain and difficult paths. Help
us to look back with gratitude on Your faithfulness and to
move forward with confidence, knowing Your presence
accompanies us always. May this assurance calm our fears and
empower us to trust You fully in every circumstance. Amen.
