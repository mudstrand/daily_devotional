===================================================================
verse:

When the fullness of time had come, God sent forth His Son
born of a woman, born under the law. (Gal.4:4)

===================================================================
reflection:

(When the right time came) God sent His Son to die for our
sins. The Jews had been waiting and waiting for the
Messiah—but God’s timing was perfect. I think we have all
been guilty of wondering if God will ever answer our
prayers; BUT we must never doubt Him or give up hope. At the
right time He will respond. Are you waiting on God’s timing?
Trust His judgment and trust that He has your interests in
mind.

===================================================================
prayer:
Sovereign God, thank You that Your timing is perfect and
Your plans are good. When my heart grows weary in the
waiting, steady my faith, quiet my doubts, and fix my hope
on Your faithful character. Help me trust Your judgment,
align my desires with Your will, and rest until Your right
time arrives. Amen. (AI)
