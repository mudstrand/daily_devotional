OUR WELL-STOCKED WARDROBE (read Mt. 6:25-34)
===================================================================
verse:

“What shall we wear?” (Mt. 6:31)

===================================================================
reflection:

There is much more to the question that is asked in Mt.
6:31. If Jesus would not have come as our Savior, we would
have asked, “What shall we wear?” with regard to the
spiritual clothes we need as we stand before God on the Last
Day and every day. Thank God we know His answer to the
question, “for He has clothed me in garments of salvation
and arrayed me in a robe of righteousness” (Isa. 61:10) The
Gospel bid us to trust in the atoning merit of Jesus Christ
and be clothed in the robes of righteousness.

===================================================================
prayer:

Righteous Father, thank You that in Christ You have clothed
me with garments of salvation and a robe of righteousness.
Quiet my anxious questions, and teach me to trust the
atoning merit of Jesus rather than my own efforts. Let me
walk each day robed in Your grace, rejoicing in the Gospel
that covers and renews me. Amen. (AI)
