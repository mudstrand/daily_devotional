NAMES WRITTEN IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE

===================================================================
verse:

O Lord, the hope of Israel, all who forsake You will be put
to shame. Those who turn away from You will be written in
the dust. (Jer. 17:13) - (read Col. 2:6-15)

===================================================================
reflection:

To have one’s name written in the dust is to stand under
God’s judgement for one’s sins. When a woman taken in
adultery was brought before Jesus, He bent down to write on
the ground with His finger. Jesus went to the cross so we
might have eternal life and have our names written, not in
sand or dust, but in granite. Those who believe in Jesus as
their Savior and Lord have been enrolled “In the Lamb’s book
of life” (Rev. 21:27). They are not only saved, but safe—
safe in the hands of Jesus, where no enemy can reach them of
delete their names from God’s list.

===================================================================
prayer:

Heavenly Father, we thank You for the powerful reminder in
the story of Jesus writing in the dust, showing Your mercy
over judgment. Through Christ's sacrifice, our names are not
written in dust but engraved eternally in the Lamb's Book of
Life, securing our salvation and safety in Your loving
hands. Help us to live with the assurance of Your grace,
confident that nothing can erase the salvation You've
secured for us. Amen. (AI)
