AND THEN SOME
===================================================================
verse:

Jesus taught the "and then some" principle. In the
Sermon on the Mount He said. "And whoever compels
you to go one mile, go with him two. (Mt. 5:41)
===================================================================
reflection:
Let's look closely at the words of a successful
businessman when asked what the secret was
to his success. He merely said " A Then Some"
He had learned early in life that the difference
between average people and truly successful
people could be summed up in these three words.
Top people did what was expected "And Then Some!"

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord, teach me the way of “and then some”—to serve beyond
what’s expected, give beyond what’s convenient, and love
beyond what’s required. Shape my work and witness with
excellence, integrity, and generosity, so that in all things
I reflect Your heart. Strengthen me to go the extra mile
with joy for Your glory. Amen. (AI)
