Today's Subject: MISPLACE LOVE (read Ps. 115)
===================================================================
verse:
Their idols are sliver and Gold, mad by human hands.
(Ps. 115:4)

===================================================================
reflection:

Many things strive for our affection, and time, and attention,
and it seems we continually need to evaluate where we're
focusing our lives. Because of this God's people are exhorted
to find their security in Him and not other gods (Jug. 18:13-16).
Jesus reiterated this in His discussion of the commandments:
"Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your
soul and all your mind" (Mt. 22:37). The Lord alone is our
"help and shield" (Ps. 115:9). May we reserve our worship
for Him. God is most worthy of our affection.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord, turn my heart from every rival love and fix my trust
in You alone—my help and my shield. Teach me to love You
with all my heart, soul, and mind, and to reserve my worship
for You who are worthy above all. Guard my focus, order my
affections, and center my life on Your glory. Amen. (AI)
