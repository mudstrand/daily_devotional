CALL 91:1 
===================================================================
verse:

Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in
the shadow of the Almighty. (Ps. 91:1) - (read Ps. 91)

===================================================================
reflection:

The phone numbers 9-1-1 in the United Sates will get you in
touch with emergency help. Its so simple even preschoolers
know what it is for, and how to use it. Often many
situations we find ourselves in cannot be remedied by human
rescores. Many of our crises require divine assistance. When
that happens, we can call a different kind of 9-1-1 ---
Psalm 91:1. There we will find the help and protection of
the Almighty God. When we face the crises of life, we often
try to survive on our own. We forget that what we need most,
is God's protection and the comfort of His presence, which
are available for the asking. We need not faer life's dark
shadows when we abide under the shadow of God's wings.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord God, thank You for being our refuge and strength, our
shelter in times of trouble as Psalm 91:1 assures us. Help
us to dwell continually under Your protective shadow,
trusting fully in Your mighty care. When life's storms come,
may we find comfort and peace in Your presence, knowing You
are our ever-present help and protector. Amen. (AI)
