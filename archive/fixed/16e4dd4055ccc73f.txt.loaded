GIVING SINCERE THANKS TO OUR CREATOR
===================================================================
verse:

Let us come into His presence with thanksgiving; let us make
a joyful noise to Him with songs of praise. (Ps. 95:2) -
(read Ps. 95)
===================================================================
reflection:

If we are totally honest I believe we would all have to say,
we struggle to come into God’s presence with the excitement
and humility that is spoken of in Psalm 95. But thankfully
the palmist directs us to not self-generate emotions but to
remember the God we worship. He is our Creator, who has
formed and protected us by his strong hands. And much
more—He is our Good Shepherd, who has made us the sheep of
His loving hands. Dear Lord lead us into your presence with
thanksgiving and joy.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord Jesus, as the psalmist of Psalm 95 invites us, lead us
to come into Your presence with thanksgiving and joyful
praise. Help us to worship You with hearts full of
gratitude, recognizing You as our Creator and Good Shepherd
who lovingly guides and protects us. May our worship be
sincere and filled with joy, drawing us closer to You each
day. Amen. (AI)

praise. (Ps. 95:2)

Food for Thought:

If we are totally honest I believe we would all have

to say, we struggle to come into God’s presence

with the excitement and humility that is spoken of

in Psalm 95. But thankfully the palmist directs us

to not self-generate emotions but to remember the

God we worship. He is our Creator, who has formed

and protected us by his strong hands. And much

more—He is our Good Shepherd, who has made us

the sheep of His loving hands. Dear Lord lead us into

your presence with thanksgiving and joy.
