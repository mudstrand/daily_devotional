KEEP GOING FOR GOD 
===================================================================
verse:

They will still bear fruit in old age, they will stay fresh
and green. (Ps. 92:14) - (read Ps. 92)

===================================================================
reflection:

A familiar saying goes something like this: "Old age is a
matter of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't
matter!" Dr's. tell us to stay active as long as we can. but
far to many folks hit middle age and put the body in
neutral. It seems that many Christians too often put their
service for Jesus Christ in the same inactive mode. Each of
us has a responsibility to God, as long as He gives us
physical and mental strength, to work heartily "as working
for the Lord" (Col. 3:23). The Psalmist said that the
righteous "will still bear fruit in old age" (Ps. 92:14).
Lets make sure that old age doesn't stop us from bearing
fruit. We need to keep going for God.

===================================================================
prayer:

Heavenly Father, thank You for Your promise in Psalm 92:14
that the righteous will still bear fruit in old age,
remaining fresh, green, and full of life. Help us to
continue serving You diligently with the strength and wisdom
You provide, no matter our age. May our lives always reflect
Your righteousness and bring glory to Your name as we
steadfastly follow You. Amen. (AI)
