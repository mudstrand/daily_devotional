THE GUARDIAN ANGELS (read Ps. 91)
===================================================================
verse:

[God] will command His angels concerning you to guard you in
all your ways. (Ps. 91:11)

===================================================================
reflection:

Much has been said about and written about angels. There are
book, songs, movies and even web sites. When the Psalmist
declares that angels attend us in all our ways, the
understanding is that we have their coverage as we discharge
our God-pleasing, Christian vocation. The promise does not
extend to activities that are sinful or that put God to the
test. When Satan tempted Jesus to leap from the highest
point of the temple, he quoted this psalm but left out some
important words. Our Lord refused to yield to this
temptation, for He knew the omitted phrase “in all your
ways” did not assure Him of angelic protection for such a
foolish act. The function of angels is threefold: to praise
God to carry out his commands and to serve mankind.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord God, we thank You for the promise in Psalm 91 that You
command Your angels to protect us in all our ways. Help us
to live in Your will and not test Your mighty protection
with foolishness. May we walk faithfully in Your path,
trusting that Your angels attend to us, carrying us safely
as we serve You. Give us humility to follow Jesus' example
by not forcing Your hand but resting in Your gentle care.
May we praise You for Your faithful provision through Your
angels and Your abiding presence. Amen. (AI)

Thoughts for Today:

Much has been said about
and written about angels. There

are book, songs, movies
and even web sites. When the
Psalmist declares that angels
attend us in all our ways, the understanding is that we have their coverage
as we discharge our God-pleasing, Christian vocation. The
promise does not extend to activities that are sinful or that put God
to the test.
When Satan tempted Jesus to leap from the highest point of
the temple, he quoted this psalm but left out
some important
words. Our Lord refused to yield to this temptation,
for He
knew the omitted phrase “in all your ways” did not assure
Him of angelic
protection for such a foolish act. The
function
of angels is threefold: to praise God to carry out his commands and to serve mankind.
