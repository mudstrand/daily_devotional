GOD'S SIGN THROUGH NATURE 
===================================================================
verse:

Jesus said: “When you see a cloud rising in the west,
immediately you say, ‘it’s going to rain,’ and it does.”
(Lk.12:54) - (read Lk. 12:54-59)

===================================================================
reflection:

How Good Are We At Interpreting Signs? For most of recorded
history, the world’s principal occupation was farming. The
farmer depended directly on the weather for his livelihood.
He needed just the right amount of sunshine and rain, to
make his living, and he grew skilled at interpreting natural
signs. Jesus was announcing an earthshaking event that would
be much more important than the year’s crops—the coming of
God’s Kingdom. Just as dark clouds forewarned of a
rainstorm, there were signs that the Kingdom would soon
arrive. But Jesus’ hearer’s though skilled at interpreting
weather signs, were intentionally ignoring the signs of the
times.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord Jesus, open our eyes to see the signs of the times that
point to Your coming Kingdom. Help us not to ignore or
reject these signs but to prepare our hearts and lives to
welcome You. Grant us the wisdom and faith to live in
anticipation, trusting in Your promises and living according
to Your will. Amen. (Al)

How
Good Are We At Interpreting Signs?

For
most of recorded history, the world’s principal

occupation
was farming. The farmer depended

directly
on the weather for his livelihood. He needed

just
the right amount of sunshine and rain, to make

his
living, and he grew skilled at interpreting natural

signs.
Jesus was announcing an earthshaking event

that
would be much more important than the year’s

crops—the
coming of God’s Kingdom. Just as dark

clouds
forewarned of a rainstorm, there were signs

that
the Kingdom would soon arrive. But Jesus’

hearer’s
though skilled at interpreting weather signs,

were
intentionally ignoring the signs of the times.
