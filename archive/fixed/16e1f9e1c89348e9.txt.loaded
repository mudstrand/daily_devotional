SIN and SALVATION 
===================================================================
verse:

All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are
justified freely by His grace through the redemption that
came by Christ Jesus. (ro. 3:23-24) - (read Ro. 3:21-26)

===================================================================
reflection:

The first truth is law, The Bible’s message of the reality
of sin. Through our first parents. Adam and Eve, sin has
come down on all humanity. Sin exacts death as the penalty.
The next truth is Gospel, God’s grace extending to all. This
grace means free, unearned, and unmerited salvation: the
forgiveness of sins, the promise of eternal life, and
spiritual newness. Salvation by God’s grace comes to us
through the merits of Christ, who atoned for the sin of the
world. The triad of truths “by grace alone,” “for Christ’s
sake alone,” and “though faith alone” has a fourth dimension
sola Scriptura. This is to say that the Bible is the only
source of what is taught in the church. By believing in
Christ as the risen Lord and Savior we become the
beneficiaries of His righteousness and holiness.

===================================================================
prayer:

Heavenly Father, thank You for the gift of Your Law that
reveals our need for salvation and Your Gospel that offers
grace through Jesus Christ. Help us to embrace Your Word
fully, trusting not in our own works but in the
righteousness You provide by faith alone. May Your Spirit
guide us to live in the freedom and newness that comes from
Your grace, rooted firmly in Your Word. Amen. (AI)

Truths to Remember:

The first truth is law,
The Bible’s message of the

reality of sin. Through our
first parents. Adam

and Eve, sin has come down
on all humanity. Sin

exacts death as the
penalty.

The next truth is Gospel,
God’s grace extending to

all. This grace means free,
unearned, and unmerited

salvation: the forgiveness of sins, the promise of

eternal life, and
spiritual newness. Salvation by God’s

grace comes to us through
the merits of Christ, who

atoned for the sin of the
world.

The triad of truths “by
grace alone,” “for Christ’s sake

alone,” and “though faith
alone” has a fourth dimension

sola Scriptura. This is to say that the Bible is the only

source of what is taught
in the church.

By believing in Christ as
the risen Lord and Savior we

become the
beneficiaries of His righteousness and

holiness.
