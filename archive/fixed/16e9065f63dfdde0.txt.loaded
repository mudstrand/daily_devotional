THINK OF THOSE WHO HAVE LESS THAN YOU

verse:
But my God shall supply all your need according to his
riches in glory by Christ Jesus. Philippians 4:19 (AI)

===================================================================
reflection:

A mother and her two children were destitute. In the depth
of winter they were nearly frozen, and so the mother took
the cellar door off its hinges and set it up in front of the
corner where they crouched down to sleep so that some of the
draft and cold might be kept from them. One of the children
whispered to her, “Mother, what do those do who have no
cellar door to put up in front of them?” Have you ever
thanked God for your many blessings and prayed for those who
have less than you?

===================================================================
prayer:

Gracious Provider, thank You for the blessings I too often
take for granted—shelter, warmth, and daily provision. Open
my heart to remember those with less, and move me to pray
and act with compassion. May I trust Your promise to supply
every need, and be generous in sharing with others. Amen.

Thought for (11-22-2019)

A mother and her two
children were destitute.

In the depth of winter
they were nearly frozen,

and so the mother took the
cellar door off its

hinges and set it up in
front of the corner where

they crouched down to
sleep so that some of the

draft and cold might be
kept from them. One of

the children whispered to
her, “Mother, what

do those do who have no
cellar door to put up

in front of them?” Have you ever thanked God

for your many
blessings and prayed for those

who have less than
you?
