OUR WORST ENEMY IS OVERCOME (read Rev. 12:7-12)
===================================================================
verse:

The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called
the devil, who leads the whole world astray. (Rev. 12:9)
===================================================================
reflection:

In my human reasoning, I believe Satan struck in the Garden
of Eden first to get even with God for throwing him out of
heaven. For this he became an avid enemy of God, he could
not avenge himself on the Lord. So Satan turn to Adam and
Eve, the very crown of creation whom God had made in His own
image. As we all know he hasn’t quit yet: “the whole world
is under the control of the evil one” (I Jn. 5:19). Take
note of this, the world is given over to all the fruits of
the flesh: “sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery;
idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of
rage, selfish ambition, dissension, factions and envy;
drunkenness, orgies, and the like” (Gal. 5:19-21). All the
while Satan tempts people to the greatest sin of
all—UNBELIEF. BUT CHRIST PAID IT ALL ON THE CROSS.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord God, we acknowledge that Satan, once an angel created
by You, became prideful and rebelled against Your authority.
His rebellion began before the fall of humanity and led to
his expulsion from heaven. Unable to take vengeance on You,
he turned his hatred toward Adam and Eve, the crown of Your
creation made in Your image. Through deceit and temptation
in the Garden of Eden, Satan introduced sin into the world,
and ever since, "the whole world is under the control of the
evil one" (1 John 5:19). Protect us from the fruits of the
flesh and the greatest sin of unbelief. Thank You, Lord
Jesus, for paying it all on the cross and conquering sin and
Satan. Strengthen our faith to remain steadfast in Your
grace and truth. Amen. (AI)

Verse for Today:

The great dragon was
hurled down—that ancient serpent

called the devil, who
leads the whole world astray. (Rev.
12:9)

Thoughts for Today:

In my human reasoning, I
believe Satan struck in the Garden

of Eden first to get even
with God for throwing him out of

heaven. For this he became
an avid enemy of God, he could

not avenge himself on the
Lord. So Satan turn to Adam and

Eve, the very crown of creation
whom God had made in His

own image. As we all know he hasn’t quit yet: “the whole

world is under the control
of the evil one” (I Jn. 5:19). Take

note of this, the world
is given over to all the fruits of the

flesh: “sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry

and witchcraft; hatred,
discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish

ambition, dissension, factions
and envy; drunkenness, orgies,

and the like” (Gal.
5:19-21). All the while Satan tempts people

to the greatest sin
of all—UNBELIEF. BUT CHRIST PAID IT
ALL

ON THE CROSS.
