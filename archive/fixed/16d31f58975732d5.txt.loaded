PERSISTENCE IN PRAYER (read Lk. 18:1-8)
===================================================================
verse:

Will not God bring about justice for His chosen ones, who
cry out to Him day and night? (Lk. 18:7)

===================================================================
reflection:

Scripture asks us to pray diligently. Ro. 12:12 says: “Be
joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.”
So the question is: what does it mean to pray without
ceasing? Really What does God want us to do? Well God has
given us work to do. As well as rest periods. To pray
unceasingly means to be diligent in prayer. Morning prayers,
evening prayers, table prayers, and prayers in special
circumstances, this adds up to the diligence God wants. Many
are the inducements for praying faithfully, especially the
invitation of Christ to come to Him with our burdens, lay
them on Him, and find rest for our souls. Our Lord does
provide for our needs, for He Himself is our rest, and our
peace.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord Jesus, teach us to pray without ceasing—not by being in
constant verbal prayer, but by having hearts continually
dependent on You and aware of Your presence throughout the
day. Help us to bring our burdens, joys, and needs to You
often, trusting Your invitation to find rest for our souls.
Strengthen us to be diligent in prayer, knowing it connects
us to Your peace and provision. May prayer be our first
response in every circumstance, keeping us faithful and
close to You at all times. Amen. (Al)

Thoughts for Today:

Scripture asks us to pray
diligently. Ro. 12:12 says:

“Be joyful in hope,
patient in affliction, faithful in

prayer.” So the
question is: what does it mean to

pray without ceasing? Really What does God want

us to do? Well God has
given us work to do. As well

as rest periods. To pray
unceasingly means to be

diligent in prayer.
Morning prayers, evening prayers,

table prayers, and prayers
in special circumstances,

this adds up to the
diligence God wants. Many are

the inducements for
praying faithfully, especially

the invitation of Christ
to come to Him with our

burdens, lay them on Him, and
find rest for our

souls. Our Lord does
provide for our needs, for

He Himself is our rest,
and our peace.
