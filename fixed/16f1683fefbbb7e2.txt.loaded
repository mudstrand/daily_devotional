DO YOU RECOGNIZE CHRIST IN CHRISTMAS?
===================================================================
verse:

And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in
swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there
was no room for them in the inn. Luke 2:7 (AI)

===================================================================
reflection:

Now if I told you to write the word “Christmas” then as you
think about the word, write the first though that flashes
though your mind. This test was given to 40 psychology
students. Here are some of the answers;
“tree—holly—mistletoe—presents—turkey—holiday— carols--and
Santa Claus,” but not one had written, “the birthday of
Jesus.” As there was no room in the inn so long ago, there
is no room for Him today in the celebration of Christmas.
This Christmas let each of us give our hearts as a present
to our Lord Jesus Christ, Who gave so much for us.


===================================================================
prayer:

Lord Jesus, make room in my heart where the world has
crowded You out—let my first thought of Christmas be Your
birth and Your love. I give You my heart as my gift: rule my
desires, reorder my priorities, and let my celebration honor
You above all. May my life proclaim that there is room for
You here, today and always. Amen. (AI)

Today’s Thought: (12-18-2019)

Now
if I told you to write the word “Christmas” then as

you think about the word, write the first though
that

flashes
though your mind. This test was given to 40

psychology
students. Here are some of the answers;

“tree—holly—mistletoe—presents—turkey—holiday—

carols--and
Santa Claus,” but
not one
had written,

“the birthday of Jesus.” As there was no room
in the

inn
so long ago, there is no room for Him today in the

celebration
of Christmas. This Christmas let each of

us
give our hearts as a present to our Lord Jesus

Christ, Who gave so
much for us.
