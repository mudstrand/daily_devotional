CHRISTIANS NEED TO STAND UP AND BE HEARD
===================================================================
verse:

When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but
when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn. Proverbs
29:2 (AI)

===================================================================
reflection:

What am I talking about? All we need to do is
listen to the news and see that Christians need
to vote for people with Christian values or we
will no longer have a say in who will lead the
country in the future. Our vote will no longer
be counted. The leader will be decided before
hand.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord, grant us wisdom and discernment to honor You in how we
steward our vote. Raise up leaders of integrity, justice,
and truth, and give Your people unity, courage, and peace as
we engage faithfully. Help us trust Your sovereignty while
acting responsibly for the good of our communities and
nation. Amen. (AI)
