THE TRUE OWNER

===================================================================
verse:

All thing have been created through Him and for Him.
(Col. 1:16) - (read Ps. 95:1-7)

===================================================================
reflection:

It is easy to take for granted all the material and
spiritual blessing that God has given us. That's why we need
to stop and remember that Scripture says the true owner of
all we possess is God's: "Everything in heaven and earth is
yours. Yours, Lord, is the kingdom: You are exalted as head
over all" (1 Cor. 29:11). Even our bodies do not belong to
us. You are not your own; you were bought with a price. We
are so abundantly blessed with good thing! Let us never take
our heavenly Father for granted, but use wisely and
gratefully all that He has given us. God gives blessings to
us so we can give glory to Him.


===================================================================
prayer:

Heavenly Father, we acknowledge that everything in heaven
and earth belongs to You, including our very lives and all
we possess. Help us to live with grateful hearts, using
wisely all that You have entrusted to us for Your glory.
Teach us to remember that we are stewards, not owners, and
to honor You in every area of our lives with the blessings
You generously provide. Amen. (AI)
