A NEW RULE 
===================================================================
verse:

He will respond to the prayer of the destitute; He will not
despise their plea. (Ps. 102:17) - (read Ps. 102:1-17)

===================================================================
reflection:

The writer of Psalm 102 Knew the importance of prayer. He
knew that God cares for us and wants to hear from us, so
start something new and take at least five minutes each
morning asking for His blessings on the day. The Lord wants
to hear from you in your destress. Your new rule just may
have a big impact on your family or someone close to you.
(remember) Prayer is an acknowledgement of our need for God.

===================================================================
prayer:

Heavenly Father, thank You for the assurance that You hear
our prayers and desire to bless our days. Teach us to make
time each morning to pour out our hearts to You, trusting
that You listen and care deeply for every need and distress.
May this daily habit strengthen our faith and positively
impact those around us. Amen. (AI)
