THE SON OF GOD SLEEPS

===================================================================
verse:

Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. (Mk. 4:38)

===================================================================
reflection:

That Jesus slept, is truly meaningful as well as comfort-
ing. It proves that God had assumed a true human nature. He
did not pretend to be human, was not an actor who came on
stage as somebody else. He was in fact a true human-being
who fit Himself into our situation. He knows from personal
experience what it means to be bone tired, to need rest
in-the-midst of life’s storms, to be able to bear only so
much physically and emotionally. What this tells us is we
have a Savior who is able to “Sympathize with our weaknesses
… one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet
was without sin” (Heb. 4:15)


===================================================================
prayer:

Heavenly Father, thank You for the beautiful truth that
Jesus, fully human, experienced fatigue and rest just as we
do. In the midst of life's storms, may we find comfort
knowing that our Savior sympathizes with our weaknesses and
rests in perfect peace, fully trusting in Your sovereign
care. Teach us to trust You with the same confidence,
resting in Your presence even when the storms rage around
us. Amen. (AI)
