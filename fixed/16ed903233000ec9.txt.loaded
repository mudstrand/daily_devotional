HOW DO WE HALLOW THE NAME OF GOD.
===================================================================
verse:

In the Lord's prayer, Jesus prayed. "Our Father who art in
heaven, hallowed be Your name." (Mt 6:9)

===================================================================
reflection:

To hallow the name of God is to regard it as holy, to treat
it differently from all other names. one of the ten
commandments warned, "You shall not misuse the name of the
Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless
who misuses His name" (Exod. 20:7). Those who hallow the
name of God take special care to avoid light, meaningless
profane reference to God.

===================================================================
prayer:

Holy Father, teach me to honor Your name as sacred—on my
lips, in my thoughts, and through my actions. Guard me from
careless or empty speech, and fill my mouth with reverence,
gratitude, and truth. Let my life hallow Your name before
others today. Amen. (AI)
