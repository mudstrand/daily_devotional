A LIFE-AND-DEATH ISSUE (read Ps. 90:1-10)
===================================================================
verse:

Our days may come to seventy years, or eighty, if our strength endures;
yet the best of them are but trouble and sorrow, for they quickly pass,
and we fly away. (Ps. 90:10)

===================================================================
reflection:

Like people since Adam and Eve, we suffer the effects of sin, and death
is certain (Ro. 6:23). Yet we can live with hope and joy, because God sent
His Son to die for our sins. Jesus conquered death when He rose from the
grave. And if we receive Him as our personal Savior and Lord, we too can
experience God's forgiveness and look forward to being with Him in heaven
for ever. Have you faced and settled this life-and-death issue?

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord Jesus, thank You for conquering sin and death and
offering forgiveness and everlasting life to all who receive
You. Give me grace to face this life-and-death issue with
faith—trusting Your cross and resurrection—and fill me with
living hope and joy. Secure my heart in You today, and keep
me ready for the day I see You face to face. Amen. (AI)
