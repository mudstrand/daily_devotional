THANKFUL RESPONSE (read Ps. 116)
===================================================================
verse:

I love the Lord because He hears and answers my prayers.
Because He bends down and listens, I will pray as long as I
have breath. (Ps. 116:1-2)

===================================================================
reflection:

God is so responsive that you can always reach Him. He bends
down and listens to your voice. This writer’s love for the
Lord had grown because he had experienced answers to his
prayers. If you are discouraged, remember that God is near,
listening carefully to every prayer and answering each one
in order to give you His best. Worship is a thankful
response and not a repayment For what God has done.

===================================================================
prayer:

Near and gracious God, thank You for bending low to hear my
voice and for answering with what is best. When I am
discouraged, remind me that You are close; let my worship be
a grateful response to Your faithful love, not a striving to
repay it. Teach me to trust Your timing and rest in Your
nearness today. Amen. (AI)
