WHO IS THE GREATEST (read Mk. 9:33-37)
===================================================================
verse:

“If anyone wants to be first, he must be the very last, and
the servant of all.” (Mk. 9:35)

===================================================================
reflection:

Jesus sat down to set the twelve straight: “If anyone wants
to be first, he must be the very last.” Jesus didn’t stop
with words. He gave the group an object lesson in humility.
He placed in their midst, a child who personified the kind
of faith and love that should mark every disciple, young or
old. The person who has a childlike—not childish—faith is a
true representative of Christ.
===================================================================
prayer:

Lord Jesus, thank You for teaching us that true greatness
comes from humble, childlike faith. Help us to embrace the
trust, dependence, and openness that children show, not with
childishness but with sincere humility. Teach us to follow
Your example by putting others first and receiving Your
kingdom with a pure heart. May our faith be marked by love
and simplicity, reflecting Your grace every day. Amen. (AI)

Thoughts for Today:

Jesus sat down to set the
twelve straight: “If anyone

wants to be first, he
must be the very last.” Jesus

didn’t stop with words. He
gave the group an object

lesson in humility. He
placed in their midst, a child

who personified the kind
of faith and love that should

mark every disciple, young
or old. The person who has

a childlike—not childish—faith
is a true representative

of Christ.
