FISHING FOR PEOPLE 
===================================================================
verse:

“Come, follow Me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers
of men.” (Mk. 1:17) - (read Mk. 1:14-20)

===================================================================
reflection:

The fish symbol ICHTHYS is an abbreviation confession of
faith—shorthand for the Greek Isus Christos Theou Hyios
Soter: Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior. The fish symbol is
fitting because Jesus drew His first disciples from
fishermen, from two sets of brothers: Peter and Andrew and
James and John. Of course we know, fish were used in some of
His miracles. As called and commissioned apostles, Peter and
the others went into the world as fishers of people to let
down the net of the Gospel, and they were effective. “The
disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord
worked with them and confirmed His Word by the signs that
accompanied it” (Mk 16:20). The ICHTHYS symbol is a reminder
that Jesus Christ is our Savior calling us to be fishers of
people and “to give an answer to everyone who asks you to
give the reason for the hope you have” (I Pet. 3:15).

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord Jesus, You called Your disciples to be fishers of
people, drawing many into Your saving grace. Help us to
carry the ICHTHYS confession of faith boldly in our hearts,
sharing the hope we have in You with those around us. May we
be faithful apostles in our time, spreading Your Word and
living as witnesses of Your love and salvation. Amen. (Al)

Today’s Verse:

“come, follow Me,”
Jesus said, “and I will make you

fishers of men.” (Mk. 1:17)

Food for Thought:

The fish symbol ICHTHYS is
an abbreviation confession

of faith—shorthand for the
Greek Isus Christos Theou

Hyios Soter: Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior.

The fish symbol is fitting
because Jesus drew His first

disciples from fishermen,
from two sets of brothers:

Peter and Andrew and James
and John. Of course we

know, fish were used in
some of His miracles.

As called and commissioned
apostles, Peter and the

others went into the world
as fishers of people to let

down the net of the Gospel,
and they were effective.

“The disciples went out
and preached everywhere,

and the Lord worked with
them and confirmed His

Word by the signs that accompanied
it” (Mk 16:20).

The ICHTHYS symbol is a
reminder that Jesus Christ

is our Savior calling us
to be fishers of people and

“to give an answer
to everyone who asks you to

give the reason for
the hope you have” (I Pet. 3:15).
