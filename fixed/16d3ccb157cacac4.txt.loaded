IT IS ALWAYS DAYTIME (read Jn. 3:16-21)
===================================================================
verse:

Whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it
may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done
through God. (Jn. 2:21)
===================================================================
reflection:

Jesus came to be the light of the world. He spoke the truth
of God’s Word as it sheds light on sinfulness and the truth
of God’s grace. All we have to do is have faith in Christ as
the one and only Savior. Faith brings forgiveness, peace
with God, light to guide us day by day, and everlasting
life. Now all God’s people can stand in the light of God’s
Word. Believers have nothing to hide, there is no need to be
secretive, no need to sit in darkness while it is day. Ask
God to let you bask in the sunshine of His love in Christ.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord Jesus, You are the Light of the world who shines in the
darkness and gives us the light of life. Help us to walk
faithfully in Your light, trusting You to guide us each day
with Your truth and grace. Fill our hearts with Your peace,
so we have nothing to hide but live openly in the joy of
Your love. May Your light shine through us to draw others to
Your saving presence. Amen. (Al)
