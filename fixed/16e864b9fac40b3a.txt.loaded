THANKFULNESS COMES FROM THE HEART
===================================================================
verse:

With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering,
forbearing one another in love. Ephesians 4:2 (AI)

===================================================================
reflection:

From An Embarrassed Waitress: A young girl sat at the
counter of an ice cream store. “How much is an ice cream
Sunday?” she asked. “Fifty cents,” the waitress answered
with hardly a glance at the child. The girl opened her fist
and counted her coins. She asked, “how much is a dish of
plain ice cream?” Annoyed, the waitress snapped, “thirty
five cents!” The girl counted out 35 cents and handed it to
the waitress. “I’ll take the plain Ice cream.” The waitress
took the money without a word and brought the ice cream.
After the small customer had eaten and left, while the
waitress was cleaning up, suddenly became flushed with
shame. There, neatly beside the dish were two nickels and
five pennies—her tip. What kind of heart do you have?
===================================================================
prayer:

Lord, give me a humble and attentive heart that notices the
worth of every person, especially the small and overlooked.
Form in me kindness, patience, and generous love, so my
actions honor others as You do. Make my everyday encounters
a quiet witness to Your grace. Amen. (AI)

From An Embarrassed Waitress:

A young girl sat at the
counter of an ice cream store.

“How much is an ice cream Sunday?”
she asked.

“Fifty cents,” the waitress
answered with hardly a

glance at the child. The girl
opened her fist and counted

her coins. She asked, “how
much is a dish of plain ice

cream?” Annoyed, the
waitress snapped, “thirty five

cents!” The girl counted
out 35 cents and handed it

to the waitress. “I’ll
take the plain Ice cream.” The

waitress took the money
without a word and brought

the ice cream. After the
small customer had eaten and

left, while the waitress
was cleaning up, suddenly

became flushed with shame.
There, neatly beside the

dish were two nickels and
five pennies—her tip.

What kind of heart do
you have? Pastor Al
