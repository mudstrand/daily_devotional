WHY ONLY ONE DAY
===================================================================
verse:

In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in
Christ Jesus concerning you. 1 Thessalonians 5:18 (AI)
===================================================================
reflection:

Charles Dickens said that we are somewhat mixed up here in
America—he told an audience that instead of having one
Thanksgiving Day each year we should have 364. “Use that one
day for complaining and griping,” he said. “We should use
the our 364 days to thank God for His many blessings, He has
showered upon us. I AGREE WITH THIS IDEA!

===================================================================
prayer:

Gracious God, turn my heart from grumbling to gratitude, not
just for a day but every day. Open my eyes to the countless
blessings You shower upon me, and teach me to give thanks in
all circumstances as an act of trust and worship. Let a
spirit of thanksgiving shape my words, my work, and my
witness. Amen. (AI)
