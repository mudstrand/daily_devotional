INFLUENCE OTHERS FOR GOOD
===================================================================
verse:

I have set you an example that you should do as I have done
for you. (Jn. 13:15)
===================================================================
reflection:

Sometime people are misled by those they respect. All
Christians need to be on guard, so that they don't mislead
children or those weak in the faith so they sin. Jesus has
sharp words for those who cause "One of these little ones
who believe in Me to sin" (Mt. 18:6). How good it is, when
Christians help someone grow in faith and understanding. Its
like when parents bring up their children "In the training
and instruction of the Lord" (Eph. 6:4). Remember such
instruction is often given by example; attitudes are caught
rather than taught. We have the greatest example In Jesus
when it comes to serving others.


===================================================================
prayer:

Lord Jesus, You warn us with sharp words about the
seriousness of causing "one of these little ones who believe
in Me to sin" (Matthew 18:6). These "little ones" are all
believers, especially those who are vulnerable or new in
faith. We pray for protection for them, that they may grow
strong in faith and be shielded from sin and false teaching.
Help us to be examples that nurture, not cause stumbling; to
instruct with care and love. May our attitudes reflect Your
servant heart, so others grow in grace by our actions and
words, following Your perfect example. Amen. (AI)
