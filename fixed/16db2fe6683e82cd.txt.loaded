RETRACING ONE’S STEPS
===================================================================
verse:

The Lord said to him, “Go back the way you came.” (I Kings
19:15)

===================================================================
reflection:

Many people try to run away from God, only to be found by
Him and told, “Go back the way you came.” No disgrace
follows such a return. One does not lose self-respect or the
esteem of others to admit the mistake of choosing a wrong
destination and the wrong way of getting there. People who
like the prodigal-son in Jesus’ parable, come back to God to
find His ready acceptance. Those who go into hiding because
they are discouraged, as Elijah was, can return to God and
to the service into which He called them. “The problem . . .
is to find out which way God is going and to go that way.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord God, thank You for Your unfailing love that welcomes us
back no matter how far we have strayed. Like the prodigal
son, help me to find the courage to return to Your embrace
without shame or fear. Guide me to follow the path You have
set, trusting in Your mercy and readiness to restore. May I
always listen for Your voice pointing the way and walk
faithfully in Your light. Amen.
