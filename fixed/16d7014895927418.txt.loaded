ARE MARRIAGES MADE IN HEAVEN (read Gen. 24:50-610
===================================================================
verse:

They called Rebekah and asked her, “Will you go with this
man?” “I will go,” she said. (Gen. 24:58)

===================================================================
reflection:

Our Lord leads us in the right direction. He, conceived by
the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary, declares, “What
God has joined together, let man not separate” (Mt. 19:6).
God guides us, urging us to do His will. Husbands and wives,
lovingly and serving one another, are a portrait of Christ
loving the church and giving up His life for her. Let us
pray that God, for Jesus sake, may help us to always Regard
marriage as honorable. No marriage so honored is accidental.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord Jesus, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of
the Virgin Mary, You teach us that what God has joined
together, no one should separate (Matthew 19:6). Help
husbands and wives to love and serve one another faithfully,
reflecting the love and sacrifice You have for Your church.
May every marriage be honored and protected, and may couples
seek to live in unity and grace, understanding that no
honorable marriage is accidental but a sacred gift from God.
Guide us to regard marriage with reverence and commitment
for Your glory. Amen. (AI)

born of the Virgin Mary, declares,

“What God has joined

No marriage so honored is accidental.
