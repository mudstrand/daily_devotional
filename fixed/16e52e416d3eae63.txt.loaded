HAVING AN ATTITUDE OF THANKS AND PRAISE

===================================================================
verse:

Enter His gates with thanksgiving, and His courts with
praise! Give thanks to Him; bless His name. (Ps. 100:4)
===================================================================
reflection:

“Enter His gates with thanksgiving, and His courts with
praise.” (this to me is even speaking of the church today)
The emphasis is that this is God’s place. I remember my
mother talking about her dad, how he would make all her
brothers remove their caps when they entered through the
gates of the church yard; because it was God’s holy place.
How unfortunate it is that we have lost this respect for
God’s property, and often for God Himself. Let this be our
prayer: “Fill us with joyful praise and thanksgiving as we
seek to serve you!"
===================================================================
prayer:

Lord, restore in us a holy reverence for Your house and Your
presence. Fill our hearts with thankful praise as we enter,
our lips with worship, and our lives with service that
honors You. Teach us to treat what is Yours with joy,
gratitude, and awe. Amen. (AI)

Subject: HAVING AN ATTITUDE OF THANKS AND PRAISE

(read Ps. 100)

Verse for Today:

Enter His gates with
thanksgiving, and His courts

with praise! Give thanks
to Him; bless His name.

(Ps. 100:4)

Thoughts of How it Once
Was:

“Enter His gates with
thanksgiving, and His courts

with praise.” (this to me is even speaking of the

church today) The emphasis
is that this is God’s

place. I remember my
mother talking about her

dad, how he would make all
her brothers remove

their caps when they entered
through the gates of

the church yard; because
it was God’s holy place.

How unfortunate it is that
we have lost this respect

for God’s property, and often
for God Himself. Let

this be our prayer: “Fill us with joyful praise and

thanksgiving as we seek
to serve you!”
