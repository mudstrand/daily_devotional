FINDING THE BLESSINGS OF LIFE
===================================================================
verse:

Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits.
Psalm 103:2 (AI)

===================================================================
reflection:

If we were given a dish of sand, and told there were
particles of iron in it, we might look for them with our
clumsy fingers and be unable to detect them. But if we were
given a magnet, to sweep through the sand, it would draw the
most invisible particles to itself. The thankless heart is
like our clumsy fingers, in the sand, it discovers no
mercies, but let the thankful heart sweep the day, and as
the magnet finds the iron, so the thankful heart will find
some heavenly blessings. Let us take time once again this
Thanksgiving Season, to examine our heart.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord, give me a thankful heart that finds Your blessings in
every moment, just as a magnet draws hidden treasures from
the sand. Help me to remember and count Your mercies, even
when they are not obvious. Let gratitude shape my outlook
and fill my days with praise for all You have done. Amen.

Today's Food for Thought:

If we were given a dish of
sand, and told there were

particles of iron in it,
we might look for them with our

clumsy fingers and be unable
to detect them. But if

we were given a magnet, to
sweep through the sand,

it would draw the most
invisible particles to itself. The

thankless heart is like our clumsy fingers, in the sand,

it discovers no mercies,
but let the thankful
heart
sweep the day, and as the magnet
finds the iron, so
the thankful heart will find some
heavenly blessings.

Let us take time once
again this Thanksgiving Season,

to examine our heart.

Pastor
Al.
