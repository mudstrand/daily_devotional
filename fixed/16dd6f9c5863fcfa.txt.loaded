PEOPLE COME FIRST (read Mk. 2:23-28)
===================================================================
verse:

For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Galatians 5:14 (AI)

===================================================================
reflection:

The well-being of the people was always to be of most
importance to the Lord. The Sabbath Law, Jesus taught, was
never intended to prevent works of love or needful action
when someone was in need. The law of love always takes
precedence. For us as New Testament people, our freedom is
clearly established. Jesus eliminated the ceremonial does
and don’ts. He fulfilled the whole law of God for us by His
obedience, His death on the cross, and His resurrection.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord Jesus, thank You for fulfilling the law and freeing us
to walk in the law of love. Teach me to use my freedom to
serve, to choose mercy over mere rule-keeping, and to meet
need with compassionate action. Let Your love be the measure
of my Sabbath and the motive of my every deed. Amen. (AI)
