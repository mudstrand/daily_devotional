OPEN THE GIFT PACKAGE
===================================================================
verse:

Mary brought forth her firstborn Son, and wrapped
Him in swaddling cloths and laid Him in the manger, because
there was no room for them in the inn.  (Lk. 2:7) 

===================================================================
reflection:

There was a gift for each of us left under the Tree of Life
2,000 years ago by Him whose birthday we celebrate today.
The gift was withheld from no man. Some have left the
packages unclaimed. Some have accepted the gift and carry it
around, but have failed to remove the wrappings and look
inside to discover the hidden splendor. The packages are all
alike: in each is a scroll on which is written, “All that
the Father hath is thine. Take and live!” Please do not
neglect to accept this gift and open it and receive the
wonderful promise.

===================================================================
prayer:

Giver of every good gift, thank You for the priceless
treasure given in Christ—the gift offered to all without
reserve. Stir our hearts not only to accept this gift but to
unwrap it fully, to believe Your promise, “All that the
Father has is yours,” and to live from its hidden splendor
each day. Keep us from neglect and awaken us to the riches
of Your grace, that we may take and live in You. Amen. (AI)

Today’s
Thoughts:

There
was a gift for each of us left under the Tree of Life
2,000 years ago by Him whose birthday we

celebrate
today. The gift was withheld from no man. Some
have left the packages unclaimed. Some have accepted
the gift and carry it around, but have failed to
remove the wrappings and look inside to discover the
hidden splendor. The packages are all alike: in each
is a scroll on which is written, “All that the Father
hath is thine. Take and live!” Please do not neglect
to accept this gift and open it and receive the
wonderful promise.
