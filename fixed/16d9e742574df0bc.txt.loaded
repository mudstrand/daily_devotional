STAYING CONNECTED (read Jn. 15:1-8)
===================================================================
verse:

“I am the Vine, you are the branches. If a man remains In Me
and I in him, he will bear much fruit.” (Jn. 15:5)

===================================================================
reflection:

In our spiritual lives, we need to be connected to the
higher power—God—to be effective in glorifying Him and
serving others. Jesus uses the illustration of a vine and
its branches. He identifies Himself as the vine and his
followers as branches. Jesus says, “No branch can bear fruit
by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear
fruit unless you remain in Me” Jn. 15: 4). We need to be
connected to the power source—Jesus Christ—if there are to
be the sweet grapes of the Words and works of Love. By the
power of the Holy Spirit, we were born again and given
faith. Faith is the critical connection.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord Jesus, You are the true Vine, and we are the branches.
Help us to remain closely connected to You, drawing our
strength, life, and purpose from Your presence. May Your
Spirit bear fruit in our lives, showing love, kindness, and
faithfulness. Teach us to abide in You so that without You,
we can do nothing, but with You, we flourish and glorify the
Father. Amen.  (AI)

can you bear fruit
unless you remain in Me” Jn. 15: 4).
