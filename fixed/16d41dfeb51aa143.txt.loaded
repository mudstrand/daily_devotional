GOD--THE WORLD'S LAND-LORD (read Ps. 24)
===================================================================
verse:

The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it, the world,
and all that lives in it. (Ps. 24:1)

===================================================================
reflection:

God desires that we be faithful and thoughtful stewards of
all His creation. Also belonging to God as His precious
possessions are the people inhabiting the earth. Christians
recognize God’s ownership of them as His people. He has not
only made them He has redeemed them. “You are not your own.
You were bought with a price” (I Cor.6:19-20). St. Peter
told us what that price was: “The Precious blood of Christ,
a lamb without blemish or defect” (I Pet. 1:19). God is our
Landlord; we are mere renters, tenants, stewards.

===================================================================
prayer:

Heavenly Father, thank You for entrusting us with the gift
of creation and the precious lives of others. Help us to be
faithful stewards of Your gifts, caring for the earth and
loving our neighbors as You have loved us. Guide us to use
wisely and share generously all that You have entrusted to
us, reflecting Your love and compassion in our daily lives.
May our actions honor You and bring glory to Your name. Amen
(Al).

Verse for Today:

The earth is the Lord’s,
and everything in it, the world,

and all that lives in
it. (Ps. 24:1)

Thoughts for Today:

God desires that we be
faithful and thoughtful stewards

of all His creation. Also belonging to
God as His precious

possessions are the people
inhabiting the earth. Christians

recognize God’s ownership
of them as His people. He has

not only made them He has
redeemed them. “You are not

your own. You were
bought with a price” (I Cor.6:19-20).

St. Peter told us what that
price was: “The Precious blood

of Christ, a lamb
without blemish or defect” (I Pet.
1:19).

God is our Landlord; we
are mere renters, tenants, stewards.
