CAN YOU FIND 16 BOOKS OF THE BIBLE
===================================================================
verse:
"Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."

Psalm119: 105 (AI)

===================================================================
reflection:
I once made a remark about the hidden books of the Bible. It was a lulu. Kept people
looking so hard for the facts and for others it was a revelation. Some were in
a jam, especially since the names of the books were not capitalized, but the
truth finally struck home to numbers of readers. To others it was not a real
job. We want it to be a most fascinating few moments for you. Yes, there will
be some real easy ones to spot. Others may require judges to help them. I will
quickly admit it usually takes a minister to find one of them, and there will
be a loud lamentations when it is found. A little lady says she brews a cup of
tea so she can concentrate better. See how well you can compete. Relax now for
there really are sixteen names of books in the Bible in this story.

===================================================================
prayer:
Lord God,
Thank You for the joy of Your Word and the way it hides truth in plain sight. As we read and reflect, open our eyes to see what we often overlook and our hearts to receive what You reveal. Give us patience to search, wisdom to understand, and delight in every discovery—whether simple or subtle. Let Your Scriptures guide us, comfort us, and unite us in wonder. Help us to cherish not only the names of the books but the Living Word to which they point, Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen. (AI)
