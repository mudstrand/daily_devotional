THANKFULNESS OUR FIRST PRIORITY 
===================================================================
verse:

I will thank the Lord because He is just: I will sing
praises to the name of the Lord Most High. (Ps. 7:17) -
(read Ps. 7:10, 11)

===================================================================
reflection:

During a time of great evil and injustice, (sounds a little
like now doesn’t it?): David was grateful that God is just
and fair. I imagine we have all wondered how many honest
people there are left in the world, but we can be assured
and thankful that God will continue to bring justice and
fairness when we involve Him in our activities. If you ever
feel you are being treated unfairly, ask the One who is
always fair and just to be with you. Then thank Him for His
presence. (read Isa. 42:1-6)

===================================================================
prayer:

Heavenly Father, in times of injustice and uncertainty, we
are grateful that You are the just and fair Judge who brings
righteousness to the world. Help us to trust Your perfect
justice and involve You in all our activities, knowing You
are always with us in every circumstance. Thank You for Your
presence that comforts and strengthens us to face whatever
comes our way. Amen. (Al)

During a time of great

there are left in the world,

but we can be assured and thankful that God will

continue to bring justice
and fairness when we involve

Him in our activities. If
you ever feel you are being
