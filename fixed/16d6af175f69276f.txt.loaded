STEADFASTNESS AMID SUFFERING (read Jm. 5:7-12)
===================================================================
verse:

You have heard of Job’s perseverance and have heard Of what
the Lord finally brought about. (Jm. 5:11)

===================================================================
reflection:

It is had to imagine how Job, a pious man, could endure the
staggering losses he suffered. Losses were his oxen, sheep,
camels, family, and health. How did Job react? He said, “The
Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; may the name of the
Lord be praised: (Job. 1:21). Job is an example to us. His
unwavering faith led him to celebrate Easter and the
Resurrection long before Jesus came into the world, because
he confessed, “I Know that my redeemer lives, and that in
the end He will stand upon the earth. And after my skin has
been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God; I myself
will see Him with my eyes— I, and not another” (Job.
19:25-27). May God grant you steadfast faith amid suffering.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord God, like Job, who endured staggering losses of oxen,
sheep, camels, family, and health, help us to trust in Your
sovereignty and faithfulness. May we, like Job, be able to
say, "El Señor dio, y el Señor quitó; bendito sea el nombre
del Señor •" (Job 1:21), rejoicing in Your holy name even
amid suffering. Strengthen our faith to hold fast to the
assurance that our Redeemer lives and that in the end, we
will see You with our own eyes (Job 19:25-27). Grant us
steadfastness and hope through every trial, knowing You are
near. Amen. (AI)
