THE RIGHT FOCUS (read Ps. 90)
===================================================================
verse:
Satisfy us. . .With Your unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and
be glad All our days. (Ps. 90:14)

===================================================================
reflection:

We call Life's older years the "sunset years." Or "the
golden years." For some they are. But for many others, even
Christians, the "sunset years" often turn into bitterness
and despair. As I have noticed contented older people, I
have learned that it is our focus more than our feelings
that determine the sort of people we are. One time an
elderly lady told me that "old age is not for sissies!." But
her groans turned into praise for God. What is your focus
today, regardless of your feelings? Is it one of gratitude
for Jesus and His gift of eternal life? If so, you'll grow
sweeter as you grow older. What you will be tomorrow depends
on the choices you make today.
===================================================================
prayer:
Faithful Lord, fix my focus on You in every season,
especially in my sunset years. Trade bitterness for
gratitude, fear for hope, and groans for praise as I
remember Jesus and His gift of eternal life. Shape my
choices today so that I grow sweeter, wiser, and more like
Christ tomorrow. Amen. (AI)
