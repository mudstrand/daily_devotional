GOD OVERRULES HUMAN ERROR (read Gen. 50:15-21)
===================================================================
verse:

You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to
accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.
(Gen, 50:20)

===================================================================
reflection:

God has a way of turning human errors so it fulfills His
will. This truth clearly emerges from the story of Joseph in
the Old Testament, where his brothers because of their
jealousy sold him into slavery. Through this act Joseph rose
from slavery into leadership. Turning to the New Testament,
we see even more clearly how God turned the hatred of Jesus’
enemies into the good of mankind, turning the brutal
crucifixion into the once-for-all sacrifice of His Son.
While God carries out His will, the evildoers are still
accountable to Him for their sins. Let us praise our Lord
for all His blessings to us.


===================================================================
prayer:

Lord God, Your ways are higher than ours, turning human
mistakes into part of Your divine plan. Like Joseph, who was
sold into slavery by his brothers but rose to save many, You
transform what seems broken into blessings. Through the
suffering and sacrifice of Your Son Jesus, You have redeemed
the world, turning evil into our salvation. Help us to trust
in Your providence, praising You for Your mercy and
faithfulness in all things. Amen. (AI)
