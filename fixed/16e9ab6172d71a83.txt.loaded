EMBARRASSING THANKLESS PEOPLE
===================================================================
verse:
In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in
Christ Jesus concerning you. 1 Thessalonians 5:18 (AI)

===================================================================
reflection:

One morning a mother took her three children to a restaurant
for breakfast. The smallest of the three children sat at the
very end of the row. She saw that other people began eating
as soon as they were served without stopping to give thanks.
When the food was served to her, she shouted out to her
mother: “Mommy, don’t people ask the blessing in this
place?” You can imagine the embarrassment of those present.
Her mother tried to hush her. But the waitress said to
little Mary, “Yes we do, sister! You give thanks!”
Amazingly, at that very moment everybody else also bowed
their heads and offered thanks. Embarrass them and maybe you
will bring them to their senses to say, “Thank You God.”

===================================================================
prayer:

Father, give us childlike courage to pause and bless You
openly, that our gratitude might awaken thanksgiving in
others. Teach us to honor You before every meal and in every
moment, remembering that all we have comes from Your hand.
Let public thankfulness become a gentle witness to Your
goodness. Amen. (AI)

Today’s Food for
Thought: (11-24-2019)

One morning a mother took
her three children to a

restaurant for breakfast. The
smallest of the three

children sat at the very end
of the row. She saw

that other people began eating
as soon as they were

served without stopping to
give thanks. When the

food was served to her,
she shouted out to her mother:

“Mommy, don’t people ask
the blessing in this place?”

You can imagine the
embarrassment of those present.

Her mother tried to hush
her. But the waitress said to

little Mary, “Yes we do,
sister! You give thanks!”

Amazingly, at that very moment
everybody else also

bowed their heads and
offered thanks. Embarrass them

and maybe you will bring them to their senses to say,

“Thank You God.”
