TEMPLES OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
===================================================================
verse:

Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy
Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? (I
Cor. 6:19) - (read I Cor. 6:12-20)

===================================================================
reflection:

Our whole make-up belongs to God. We confess God to be the
maker of heaven and earth, and so is also Creator of each
person’s body and soul. But there is more. Not only do we
belong to God because He made us and the Son of God redeemed
us, but also because the Holy Spirit lives in us to
enlighten us with His gifts, sanctify us, and keeps us in
the true faith. So it is important that we welcome Him
through holy living.

===================================================================
prayer:

Heavenly Father, Creator of body and soul, we thank You for
making us and redeeming us through Your Son. We are grateful
that Your Holy Spirit dwells within us to enlighten,
sanctify, and keep us in true faith. Help us to welcome and
honor the Spirit by living holy lives that reflect Your love
and grace. Amen. (Al)
