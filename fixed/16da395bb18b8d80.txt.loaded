THE POWER OF LOVE (read Jn. 15:9-17)
===================================================================
verse:

“Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his
life for his friends.” (Jn. 15:13)

===================================================================
reflection:

Jesus the Bread of Life, gained salvation for all when in
love He became an atoning sacrifice on the cross. He called
His disciples His friends, telling them that love prompted
Him to lay down His life for them. What’s more, His
redeeming, life-give love extends to all mankind, including
His enemies. “When we were God’s enemies, we were reconciled
to Him through the death of His Son” (Ro. 5:10). “Christ
died, that’s history. . .Christ died for you and me, that’s
salvation. “AMEN”

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord Jesus, You are the Bread of Life who loved us so deeply
that You laid down Your life as the perfect atoning
sacrifice on the cross. Your death reconciled us to the
Father, even when we were His enemies, showing the boundless
reach of Your redeeming love. Help us to remember that Your
sacrifice is not just history but our present salvation and
hope. May we live each day in gratitude for the grace You
have given us through Your sacrificial love. Amen.  (AI)
