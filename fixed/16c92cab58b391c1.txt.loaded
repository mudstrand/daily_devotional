THE NEED OF MERCY
===================================================================
verse:


For he never thought of doing a kindness, but hounded to
death the poor and the needy and the brokenhearted. (Ps.
109:16) - (read Ps. 109: 21-31)

===================================================================
reflection:

Many of us have experienced the pain that David expressed in
Psalm 109. When he was hurt and vulnerable, insensitive
people took advantage of him. Certainly, if he had sinned,
he needed their loving correction. Anyone with the mind of
Christ should not act unmercifully toward a brother or
sister in the body of Christ. Rather, we must "Show Mercy"
(V. 16 NKJV). A hurting person needs a helping hand, not an
accusing finger.

===================================================================
prayer:

Heavenly Father, in times of hurt and betrayal, help us to
respond with mercy and compassion rather than bitterness and
accusation. Grant us the grace to be a support to those who
are vulnerable and hurting, reflecting Christ's love in all
our interactions. Teach us to show mercy as You have shown
to us, bringing healing where there is pain. Amen. (AI)
