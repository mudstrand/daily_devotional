UNBELIEF, A STOPPER (read Mk. 6:1-6)
===================================================================
verse:

Jesus could not do any mighty works. … He marveled Because
of their unbelief. (Mk. 6:5, 6)

===================================================================
reflection:

When celebrities come home, their communities often welcome
and honor them. Not so with Nazareth and Jesus. Why was
that? The reason for shutting the door to Jesus was
unbelief. They went so far as to try and throw Him off a
cliff in order to kill Him. There is no greater barrier to
the work of Jesus Christ than unbelief. Remember Jesus
Christ works by love. He witnesses to the love of God that
does not abandon sinners but pleads with them to accept Him
in faith and thus obtain the salvation He procured. He wants
to come in and share with us the gifts He brings
===================================================================
prayer:

Lord Jesus, we see how Your own hometown rejected You
because of unbelief, shutting the door to Your invitation of
love and salvation. Yet, Your love never ceases to call us,
pleading with sinners to turn to You in faith. Help us to
open our hearts without hesitation, trusting in Your mercy
and grace. May we receive You as our Friend and Savior,
welcoming the gifts You bring that transform and save.
Strengthen our faith so that unbelief will no longer be a
barrier to Your work in our lives. Amen. (AI)

unbelief. (Mk. 6:5, 6)

Thoughts for Today:

When celebrities come
home, their communities often

welcome and honor them.
Not so with Nazareth and

Jesus. Why was that? The
reason for shutting the door

to Jesus was unbelief.
They went so far as to try and

throw Him off a cliff in
order to kill Him. There is no

greater barrier to the
work of Jesus Christ than unbelief.

Remember Jesus Christ
works by love. He witnesses

to the love of God that
does not abandon sinners but

pleads with them to accept
Him in faith and thus obtain

the salvation He procured.
He wants to come in and

share with us the gifts
He brings
