GOD'S SURPASSING WISDOM (read Eph. 2:8, 9)
===================================================================
verse:

It is by grace you have been saved. (Eph. 2:8)

===================================================================
reflection:

Here is a thought that passes our understanding. It has to
do with our relationship between God’s universal grace—the
fact that God wants all people to be saved (I Tim. 2:4)—and
salvation by God’s grace alone. If God predestines and gives
the power to believe, why doesn’t He do this for all?
Perhaps in eternity we will understand. In the mean-time let
us faithfully adhere to the truths of salvation God has
revealed in His Word. Let us remember we are all sinners,
incapable of self-salvation. To save us, God sent His Son to
redeem us, and He continues to send His Holy Spirit to
create and confirm faith in us. How thankful we should be
for the work God has performed in us and through us
proclaims it to others.

===================================================================
prayer:

Heavenly Father, thank You for Your amazing grace that calls
all people to salvation through Jesus Christ. We acknowledge
that only by Your Spirit's work are we awakened to faith and
drawn into a saving relationship with You. Help us to trust
fully in Your revealed truths, even when mysteries remain
beyond our understanding. May Your Holy Spirit continue to
create and strengthen our faith, guiding our lives to
proclaim Your saving love to others. Amen. (AI)

Thoughts for Today:

Here is a thought that
passes our understanding. It has

to do with our
relationship between God’s universal

grace—the fact that God
wants all people to be saved

(I Tim. 2:4)—and salvation
by God’s grace alone. If God

predestines and gives the
power to believe, why doesn’t

He do this for all? Perhaps
in eternity we will understand.

In the mean-time let us
faithfully adhere to the truths of

salvation God has revealed
in His Word. Let us remember

we are all sinners,
incapable of self-salvation. To save us,

God sent His Son to redeem
us, and He continues to send

His Holy Spirit to create
and confirm faith in us. How

thankful we should be for
the work God has performed

in us and through us
proclaims it to others.
