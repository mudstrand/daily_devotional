JESUS THE WAY TO HEAVEN (read Jn. 14:1-140
===================================================================
verse:

“You know the way to the place where I am going. . . . I am
the Way and the Truth and the Life.” (Jn. 14:4, 6)

===================================================================
reflection:

In vs. 5 Peter should have known the answer to his question
“how do we know the way?” But he wasn’t 100% sure. Because
of the answer he received the all Important point is now
clear to us. We now know where we are going and we know the
Way. In this reading Jesus prepares His disciples for His
departure. He was returning to His Heavenly Father, but they
were to travel on to be His witnesses in the world. Jesus is
the one and only Son of the Father, and the one and only Way
to Him. He reconciled us to God by bearing our sins to
Calvary’s cross and leaving them there.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord Jesus, You are the Way, the Truth, and the Life. When
Peter asked how to know the way, You revealed that You alone
are that Way. You reconcile us to God by bearing our sins on
the cross, opening the path to the Father. As Your
disciples, help us to follow You faithfully, knowing there
is no other path to salvation but through Your sacrifice and
resurrection. May we be confident in this truth and boldly
witness to others about the hope we have in You. Amen. (AI)

Thoughts for To Day:

In vs. 5 Peter should have
known the answer to his

question “how do we know
the way?” But he wasn’t

100% sure. Because of the
answer he received the

all Important point is now
clear to us. We now know

where we are going and we
know the Way. In this

reading Jesus prepares His
disciples for His departure.

He was returning to His Heavenly
Father, but they

were to travel on to be His
witnesses in the world.

Jesus is the one and only
Son of the Father, and the

one and only Way to Him. He
reconciled us to God

by bearing our sins to Calvary’s
cross and leaving

them there.
