NO ONE IS TO SMALL
===================================================================
verse:

[Zacchaeus] wanted to see who Jesus was, but being a short
man he could not see. (read Lk. 19:3)

===================================================================
reflection:

Zacchaeus, the tax collector in Jericho, was small but that
did not keep him from seeing Jesus or Jesus from seeing him.
Life’s circumstances— height, age, income—are of no
significance to Jesus. Because of original sin, we are all
on the same level in the sight of God. In Christ, the
Mediator, He has compassion on us all. Our Lord is concerned
about little people. He accepts and blesses the little
children we bring to Him in Holy Baptism. The Lord has a
heart for all.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord Jesus, just as You saw Zacchaeus despite his small
stature and past, see me with compassion and love. Remind me
that life's circumstances do not limit Your care and grace.
Help me to trust in Your heart that embraces all, especially
the little and overlooked. May I come to You with childlike
faith, knowing that in Your sight, I am deeply valued and
blessed. Amen. (AI)
