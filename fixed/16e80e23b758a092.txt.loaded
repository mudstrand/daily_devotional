TRUE GRATEFULNESS
===================================================================
verse:
And we know that all things work together for good to them
that love God, to them who are the called according to his
purpose. Romans 8:28 (AI)

===================================================================
reflection:

Thoughts from Matthew Henry: When Matthew Henry was robbed,
that very night he prayed: “I thank Thee, first because I
was never robbed before; second, because although they took
my purse, they did not take my life; third, because although
they took my all, it was not much; and fourth, because it
was I who was robbed, and not I who robbed.” Let us practice
this type of attitude.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord, give me the grace to find reasons for gratitude even
in difficult circumstances. When trials come, help me to
trust Your sovereignty and count my blessings rather than my
losses. Shape my heart to be thankful for Your protection,
provision, and the privilege of integrity, even when life is
hard. Amen. (AI)
