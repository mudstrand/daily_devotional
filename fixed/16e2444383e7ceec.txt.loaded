CHRISTIANS as SAINTS

===================================================================
verse:


Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share
in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light.
(Col. 1:12) - (read Col. 1:5-13)

===================================================================
reflection:

Christians: even before they enter the kingdom of light in
heaven, are people who let the light of the Gospel shine
through in their lives. In all they say and do—and in all
the evil things they leave undone—they give evidence of
their commitment to God, the Father of lights. How do people
become saints who let the light shine through? It begins
when the Holy Spirit enlightens them through the Gospel and
Holy Baptism, bring them to faith in Jesus Christ, as their
Savior. To declare Christian as bona fide saints is not to
say that they are perfect. They are sinners still because of
their continuing spiritual weakness. But sin does not rule
their lives; Jesus Christ does.

===================================================================
prayer:

Heavenly Father, sanctify us through Your Word and truth,
and fill us with the power of Your Holy Spirit. Help us to
live lives that reflect Your holiness, shining as lights in
the world even amidst spiritual weakness. May our faith
remain firm in Jesus Christ, who rules over sin and leads us
to eternal life. Amen. (AI)

Verse for Today:

Giving thanks to the
Father, who has qualified you to

share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom

of light. (Col. 1:12)

Food for Thought:

Christians: even before they enter the kingdom of light

in heaven, are people who
let the light of the Gospel

shine through in their
lives. In all they say and do—and

in all the evil things
they leave undone—they give

evidence of their
commitment to God, the Father of

lights. How do people
become saints who let the light

shine through? It begins
when the Holy Spirit enlightens

them through the Gospel
and Holy Baptism, bring them

to faith in Jesus Christ,
as their Savior. To declare

Christian as bona fide saints
is not to say that they are

perfect. They are sinners
still because of their continuing

spiritual weakness. But
sin does not rule their lives;

Jesus Christ does.
