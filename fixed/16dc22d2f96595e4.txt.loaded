ONE LORD JESUS CHRIST (read I Cor. 1:10-17)
===================================================================
verse:

Is Christ divided? (I Cor. 1:13)
===================================================================
reflection:

When Paul asked the Corinthian church, “Is Christ divided?”
He was referring to the division in the congregation with
some saying they followed Paul or Apollos or Cephas, and the
like. This Paul maintained, is dividing Christ and
effectively destroying the unity of faith in Christ. Paul
told the church, “there is one body and one Spirit— just as
you were called to one hope when you were called—one Lord,
one faith, one Baptism; one God and Father of all” (Eph.
4:4-6). Satan as always tried to divide Christ, and so
destroying the unity in the church


===================================================================
prayer:

Lord Jesus, You are the one true Head of the Church, and we
thank You for calling us into unity through one Spirit, one
faith, and one baptism. Help us to resist divisions and
instead focus on You as our Lord and Savior. May we remember
that no human leader was crucified for us-only You-and that
our loyalty belongs solely to You. Unite our hearts in love
and purpose, so that we may reflect Your oneness and glory
to the world. Amen. (AI)
