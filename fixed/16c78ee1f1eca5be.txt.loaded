MAKE A JOYFUL SHOUT

===================================================================
verse:

Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth. (Ps.100:1) -
(read Ps. 100)


===================================================================
reflection:

The songwriter of Ps. 100 took his allegiance to the Lord
seriously and wanted others to do the same. When we were
kids, we were told to sit still and be quiet in church.
(right?) But, God's goodness and grace should motivate us to
freely express our love and allegiance to the Lord. We need
to push back the boundaries of restraint and lean what is
means to be expressive in our praise to God. Worship is a
time to focus on our Creator, Redeemer, and Shepherd, and
celebrate what He has done for us.

===================================================================
prayer:

Heavenly Father, may all our prayers, worship, and praise
flow from a heart that honors Your greatness and worthiness,
not from a desire for what we can gain. Help us to focus on
You, cherishing the relationship we have with You above all
else. May our worship be a true reflection of Your infinite
value and majesty, done solely for Your glory and not our
benefit. Amen. (AI)
