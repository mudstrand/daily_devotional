GRACE AND TRUTH IN CHRIST (read Jn. 1:1-14)
===================================================================
verse:

The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us. . .
Full of grace and truth. (Jn. 1:14)

===================================================================
reflection:

In the realm of spiritual beliefs, truth is even more
precious. God reveals His truth abundantly in His Word and
He broadcasts it in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. But people
are preoccupied with self-centered pursuits. They have not
tuned in. Both their reception and their perception leave
much to be desired. Because this has been true since the
fall into sin, God sent His truth to earth in the person of
Jesus Christ.

===================================================================
prayer:

Lord God, Your truth is precious and abundant, revealed
fully in Your Word and supremely in the Gospel of Jesus
Christ. Yet, many are distracted by self-centered pursuits
and fail to receive or perceive this truth. Since the fall
into sin, You sent Jesus to be the living Word, the perfect
revelation of Your love and grace, so that we might know and
follow You rightly. Help us to tune our hearts and minds to
Your truth and to live by it faithfully every day. Amen.

Thoughts for Today:

In the realm of spiritual
beliefs, truth is even more precious. God reveals His truth
abundantly in His
Word and He broadcasts it in the Gospel of
Jesus
Christ. But people are preoccupied with self-centered
pursuits. They have not tuned in. Both their reception
and
their perception leave much to be desired.
Because this
has been true since the fall into sin,

God sent His truth to
earth in the person of Jesus Christ.
