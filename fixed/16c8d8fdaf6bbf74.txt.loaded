BEWARE OF QUICK FIXES

===================================================================
verse:

But they soon forgot what they had done and did not wait for
His plan to unfold. (Ps. 106:13) - (Ps. 106:1-15)

===================================================================
reflection:

How many of us have been guilty of praying only in a crisis.
How many of us have a "Quick fix" mentality that sees God
mainly as a problem solver. And when merciful solutions
come, He is courteously thanked, then more or less forgotten
until the next crisis. If you read Psalm 106: 1-15 you will
see that it contains a serious warning against dismissing
God from our lives--as if that was possible. Anticipate
great things from God, but don't expect Him to come at your
beck and call. Instead, be at His beck and call, eager to
fulfill His will. Ask God to accompany you through life's
dark pathways. But instead of dismissing Him when your
special needs are met, cling to Him as if your life depended
on it. It does! REMEMBER GOD IS NOT A VENDING MACHINE. . .

===================================================================
prayer:

Heavenly Father, help us to remember Your unwavering
faithfulness through all the trials and temptations we face,
just as Your people did in Psalm 106. May we never treat You
as a convenience for quick fixes, but always remain at Your
beck and call, eager to fulfill Your will. Teach us to rely
on You daily, trusting in Your mercy and grace to guide us
through life's dark paths without forgetting to praise You
in all circumstances. Amen. (AI)
