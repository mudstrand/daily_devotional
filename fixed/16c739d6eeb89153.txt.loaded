ONLY FOR HIM

===================================================================
verse:

I will sacrifice a thank offering to You and call on the
name of the Lord. (Ps. 116:17) - (read Ps. 95)

===================================================================
reflection:

Many think our Godward actions such as: prayer, singing,
worship and reading Scriptures, are done as safety devices
to prevent the Lord from zapping us. When we think of God
that way, we will have wrong motives for any God-directed
action. That kind of thinking leads us to pray and worship
God for personal gain or approval. Our worship of the Lord
is not done so we can somehow benefit. Instead, every
heavenward thought or action should be done out of honor for
Him and His greatness. Sure, we benefit when we turn our
attention to God, but that should not be our motivation. It
is not for us we worship God. It should always be for Him.
We don't worship God to gain His benefits--we already have
them.

===================================================================
prayer:

Heavenly Father, may all our prayers, worship, and praise
flow from a heart that honors Your greatness and worthiness,
not from a desire for what we can gain. Help us to focus on
You, cherishing the relationship we have with You above all
else. May our worship be a true reflection of Your infinite
value and majesty, done solely for Your glory and not our
benefit. Amen. (AI)
